As the left main tank quantity was decreasing more rapidly than the right, I had the FO (First Officer) go to the cabin for a visual inspection of the area around the left engine. He returned to the flight deck and reported nothing unusual. All other flight deck switches and indications were normal.Given the rate of the growing imbalance, approaching 700 lbs less in the left versus right tank, we decided to commence the Fuel Imbalance QRH checklist. As the checklist would direct a shutdown of the #1 engine, we requested priority handling with Center and began a diversion to ZZZ. We completed the checklist as we descended, accomplished a single-engine landing, and proceeded to the gate otherwise uneventfully.		Upon reaching FL 340 cruise altitude, the Captain noticed that the left fuel indicator showed approximately 500 lbs less than the right tank. We also noticed that the left fuel indications (quantity and lbs) were decreasing faster than the right indications. It was a ferry flight with only the two Pilots and two FAs (Flight Attendants) onboard, so the Captain had me go to the rear and look for indications of fuel leak. Using the wing lights and a flashlight I carry I was unable to see any loss of fuel occurring.Upon returning to the flight deck, the Captain had the QRH out and was looking at the procedure. At this time it reached its max imbalance of 700 lbs. We executed the QRH checklist. It required the shutdown of the left engine. The Captain coordinated with ATC and requested priority handling for fuel, and we diverted to ZZZ. The descent, approach, and landing were uneventful. We executed the QRH until the procedure was complete.		B737-700 flight crew reported a growing fuel imbalance during cruise and the subsequent decision for an in-flight engine shut down and diversion to another airport.

We stopped the aircraft and began looking for any configuration error that could be causing the light to go off. We looked all over the flight deck, including the overhead panel, and could find nothing out of place or anything that would trigger this horn and light. It was a flaps 1 takeoff and they were at 1 and showed 1. The trim was properly set at between 5 and 6 to my recollection. The speed brake was down and stowed; and we checked it, jiggled it, it was definitely where it was supposed to be. All the door lights were out as well as the PSEU (Proximity Switch Electronics Unit) light.I had flown the airplane once that day and had no issues at all, so we put the flaps back up, waited a beat, and then reset the flaps to 1. The Captain then performed another throttle burst. We could not get the warning horn or the light to go off this time. We re-checked the configuration and probably did two handfuls of throttle bursts to make sure, and we could not get the issue to repeat itself. The airplane appeared fine. We continued our taxi and received our lineup and wait clearance and eventual take off clearance. It was the Captain's takeoff and the takeoff roll was normal. V1 was 132 knots. At 125 knots I was opening my mouth to call V1 as the aircraft continued accelerating; and at that very instant, the warning horn and light went off. The Captain performed the RTO per the QRH. After completing this, we then pulled the brake cooling data from the performance system; and it said we could return to the gate and required 50 minutes of brake cooling. We gave all the information to Maintenance and called Dispatch and Maintenance Control.		Our takeoff warning horn activated during the throttle check portion of the Before Takeoff Checklist. I stopped the aircraft, and we checked for all the items that would activate the takeoff warning horn. We did not find anything that was out of position to trigger the takeoff warning horn-flaps were at 1, trim in the green band, speed brake lever handle down and stowed, all door lights were out, and no PSEU light. As we troubleshot the takeoff warning horn, we made sure the speed brake handle was down and stowed, and we cycled the flaps from Flaps 1 to UP and back down to Flaps 1. After doing that, the takeoff warning horn could not be activated again. I must have tested the throttles and tried to active the takeoff warning horn 8-10 times before taking the aircraft onto the runway for takeoff. Both the First Officer and I agreed that the takeoff warning horn problem was resolved before we proceeded to taxi again to the runway for takeoff. Auto throttle was engaged for our takeoff. V1 was at 132 knots. At 125 knots we got the takeoff warning horn and the takeoff configuration warning light. I felt the aircraft fell into the unsafe category at that time and announced 'reject' and performed the Rejected Takeoff procedure per the QRH. After running the QRH, we calculated the RTO brake cooling requirement to be 50 minutes at the gate. We returned to the gate and gave all the information we had to Maintenance.		B737-700 flight crew reported a rejected take off after the T/O Configuration Warning Light and T/O Warning Horn sounded at 80 knots.

We assumed this was an ECAM associated with our current deferral F/CTL AIL SERVO fault and decided to continue rather than abort. When at a safe altitude, we reviewed the ECAM in detail and concluded that this was a separate issue and we should have aborted.		On takeoff from ZZZ [Runway] XX, we received an ECAM at about 60 kt. for Ground Spoiler 3+4, which we thought was associated with the Aileron Servo Fault deferral. I elected to continue the takeoff and once airborne we were able to tell that it was indeed a separate issue. We should have rejected the takeoff. Unfortunately, the Aileron Servo Fault deferral generated multiple transient ECAMs during start and power changes and we became accustomed to them. They went away in a second or two. On the takeoff roll, we thought it was yet another transient and associated ECAM. I had talked to the inbound Captain who gave us the jet initially in ZZZ1 and he mentioned that there were a lot of stray ECAMs associated with the deferral and it probably added to my thinking that this was another one of those. Airborne, we ran the QRH checklist and determined our landing distances for ZZZ1, made the write-up, and landed normally.		A320 flight crew reported receiving a Spoiler System ECAM alert on takeoff and elected to continue the takeoff. At altitude and reviewing the ECAM alert, flight crew discovered takeoff should have been rejected and wrote up the alert for maintenance.

The flight had been uneventful all the way through the approach. We were cleared for the visual approach to Runway XX at ZZZ, and after contacting Tower, we were given our landing clearance. Aircraft were landing and departing on Runway XX as well as departing on Runway XYR. I did not specifically hear a takeoff clearance for an aircraft for Runway XX while we were on final. At 400 ft. AGL, an aircraft entered Runway XX. The Captain said out loud that this didn't look right and I commented that the aircraft may be crossing the runway where an FBO is on the other side but it seemed closer than what the Tower usually allowed. The aircraft then made the ninety degree turn to lineup on the runway and immediately started taking off. At that instant the Captain already said he was going around, and before I could say anything [to] the Tower, the Controller directed us to go-around. We were then given a right turn and altitude to climb. The Captain performed a smooth and normal go-around and we were handed off to Departure. Approach re-vectored us for the visual back to Runway XX, where we landed without further incident and taxied to the gate.Go-around when an aircraft entered red landing runway while on short final.		Landing configuration, Runway XX (ZZZ). We were cleared to land. Aircraft entered the landing runway at approximately 500 ft. AGL. We initiated a go-around, and circled back to land with no further incident. Go-around due to aircraft on landing runway. Radio congestion, increase awareness of surroundings at a busy facility.		B737-700 flight crew reported a ground conflict during short final resulting in a go-around.

Speed assigned 170. Flaps 5 selected. At ILS GP and course intercept experienced wake turbulence. Brief stick shaker due to wake turbulence roll. Added power, recovered, stayed on ILS path and advised ATC of the encounter. Turned back on auto pilot/ throttle and shortly confirmed we were good to continue the approach. Landed without incident.Carry more speed above yellow bar, I could have configured to flaps 10.	Reporter stated wake encounter was stronger than they expected.	Wake turbulence was encountered during an ILS approach to Runway 16R in SEA after receiving approach clearance. Prior to GS intercept and maintaining 4,000 ft. at an issued speed of 170 knots, the aircraft unexpectedly jolted and rolled with varying pitch, momentarily activating the stick shaker due to the wake. Immediate recovery was conducted with a small variation in altitude while tracking the LOC path. After stabilizing the aircraft it was determined that sufficient distance remained to safely continue the approach and landing, which was conducted without incident. ATC was advised of the encounter. Maintaining extreme vigilance of wake turbulence is imperative at all times, even in the absence of an ATC transmitted 'wake turbulence' caution.		B737-900 Flight Crew reported encountering wake turbulence on descent into SEA.

Only the artificial horizon, amber SPD flag and amber ALT flag remained. The First Officer PFD retained all data and the B autopilot remained engaged. About a minute after the loss of the Captain PFD, all information returned. A complete review of Airspeed Unreliable checklist was completed. About five minutes later, the problem returned for about double the time (2 minutes). We contacted Dispatch and had them bring 737 Maintenance into the crew phone app connection. After a brief discussion, it was determined the aircraft would be grounded at our destination ZZZZ1 and it would be best to return to ZZZ (350 miles away) to have the problem resolved. We landed in ZZZ uneventfully without declaring an emergency (the Captain's PFD was working normally during the descent and arrival). Background information: Two days prior to our departure, the AML noted a ladder had fallen on the Captain window and AOA (Angle Of Attack) vane. The Captain window was replaced.				B737-800 pilot reported loss of the Captain's PFD in cruise. After discussion with Dispatch and Maintenance, it was decided to perform and air turn back to prevent the aircraft from being grounded at an out station.

ZZZ switched runways. We were able to brief and prepare for the new northbound flow, but it caused numerous operational issues, as many aircraft were waiting for arrivals to the old runway. We taxied single engine, due to congestion. Following startup of [Engine] #1, a slight split throttle situation was observed, but we only taxied forward the length of the aircraft so it was not significant or consistent to warrant further investigation. Compounding the limited ramp and ground space at ZZZ, ATC needed 20 miles separation for northbound departures. We were cleared for takeoff with an aircraft on final and another just clearing the runway. After transferring aircraft control, the PF (Pilot Flying) called set takeoff thrust with A/T (autothrottles) engaged and the PM (Pilot Monitoring) missed the 80-knot call, instead calling 90 knots. The #2 Engine had stabilized IVO (within 0.1-0.3 %) takeoff thrust at the 90-knot call. Since HOLD engaged, the PM attempted to manually match the N1's, but was unable to manually match the #1 Engine. During climb out, the #2 Engine would not advance beyond approximately 87% with AT engaged though the FMC and AT were commanding a higher %. The PM requested and granted control of the engines, disengaged the A/T and attempted to manually advance the #2 Engine to climb thrust. The engine would still not advance beyond approximately 87%, though the white command bar was responding correctly to the manual throttle input and the white arc was visible on the N1 gauge and the #1 engine reacted normally while physically matching the #2 throttle position. No other engine vibrations or anomalies were noted. After cockpit coordination, the PM requested priority handling, received clearance for a lower altitude than assigned and a vector off of the assigned SID. Using Crew coordination, we verified that each of us was seeing the same indications and response from the #2 engine. The PF placed the #2 Engine thrust lever to idle, we ran the checklist with a plan to divert to ZZZ1, while shooting a precautionary single engine approach and keeping the #2 Engine in idle, where it was operating stable and within parameters. We coordinated with ATC and ZZZ1 Operations, who assisted with a patch through to Dispatch Desk. We coordinated with the F/As (Flight Attendants), made a PA, prior to starting our approach into ZZZ1, ran numbers for a flaps 15 landing and ran brake cooling numbers which indicated a 50 minute at the gate cooling time. We transferred aircraft control and the Captain took over the PF duties, while shooting a precautionary single engine visual backed up with an ILS to XXL into ZZZ1. We touched down normally, taxied clear, coordinated with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) #1, who indicated no anomalies were observed. We taxied uneventfully to the gate where the passengers deplaned normally to be accommodated on a later flight under the same flight number. We completed coordination with ZZZ1 Maintenance, Dispatch, Supervisor on Duty, Operations Center Chief Pilot on Call, Manager on Call and Scheduling, while completing Page XXXXXXXX of the logbook.		We were cleared for takeoff on Runway XX, with an aircraft on final and another just clearing the runway. After transferring aircraft control, as the PF (Pilot Flying), I called for takeoff thrust with the A/T (Autothrottle) engaged. The takeoff was completely normal, and I was unaware of any engine abnormalities until approximately 1,000 feet. During climb out, the #2 Engine would not advance beyond approximately 87% with A/T engaged, even though the FMC and A/T were commanding a higher rating by approximately 1-2%. The Captain (PM) requested and was granted control of the engines, disengaged the AT and attempted to gently advance the #2 Engine to climb thrust. The engine would still not advance beyond approximately 87%, though the white command bar was responding correctly to the manual throttle input. The white arc was visible on the N1 gauge and the #1 Engine reacted normally while physically matching the #2 throttle position. No other engine vibrations or anomalies were noted. After cockpit coordination, the PM (Pilot Monitoring) requested priority handling, received clearance for a lower altitude and a vector off the assigned SID. Using crew coordination, we verified that each of us were seeing the same indications and response from the #2 Engine. We decided to place the #2 engine thrust lever to idle, ran QRH the checklist with a plan to shoot a precautionary single engine approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ1, which was in sight at this time. The #2 Engine operated normally at idle, in a stable condition, within all expected parameters.  We coordinated with ATC, coordinated with ZZZ1 Operations who assisted with a patch through to Dispatch, coordinated with the F/As (Flight Attendants), made a PA prior to starting our approach into ZZZ1, ran numbers for a flaps 15 landing and ran brake cooling numbers which indicated a 50 minute cooling time, and safe to accomplish at the gate. We transferred A/C (aircraft) control and the Captain took over the PF duties for the precautionary single engine approach and landing. We touched down normally, taxied clear, coordinated with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) #1 who observed nothing unusual about the #2 Engine. We taxied uneventfully to the gate where the passengers deplaned normally to be accommodated on a later flight. The Captain completed coordination with ZZZ1 Maintenance, Dispatch, Supervisor on Duty, Company Operations Chief Pilot on Call, Manager on Call, and I contacted Scheduling, to discuss a plan to complete the remainder of our trip.		B737 flight crew reported a diversion after engine power loss on takeoff.

Aircraft X, ZZZ-ZZZ1. Cruising at FL 380, at XA20 CT, we got an instantaneous #2 Engine LO Quantity 20% and flashing white box. All other oil indications were normal, as well as engine. Prior to event, oil quantities were normal and matched closely. We assessed that we could end up single engine soon, and started looking for nearest suitable airports, if we needed to do that. Additionally, started to review QRC/QRH in preparation for a possible engine failure or shutdown. We coordinated with ZZZ2 Center, for a lower altitude and airspeed. Assigned FL 350, then soon after FL 320. Slowed to74. At XA30 CT, contacted (Company) Dispatch and advised them of our situation, also short conversation with Maintenance. He advised, follow QRH guidance.Top Of Descent, followed soon after, and we continued our assessment of possible landing airports as we monitored the #2 engine. The quantity slowly went down, but would tick up sporadically, then continue down, very slow. While on the arrival branch point, we decided to request preferential coordination direct to ZZZ1. Final approach it was reading 10%, then went to 6% at landing. Landed ZZZ1 Runway XXR uneventfully. While taxi back to terminal, it increased to 20% and remained there at shutdown. Our constant question was, 'what is the limit, zero, or a predetermined %, when the motor would fail?'The next day, I called Maintenance to ascertain if they had found anything out. Maintenance said they were still looking at it with GE Tech Support and had come across Main Bearing and Main Bearing Seal failure, but it wasn't definitive yet. He did tell me that oil was bypassing into another container or void space where it shouldn't go.				B737 Captain reported an Engine Oil Quantity Lo annunciation while at cruise. The flight crew continued the flight to the destination airport while monitoring oil quantity.

Apparently, this was night 1 of three days that the system was to be purposely down for maintenance of some sort. While the timing worked well for the US/domestic operation (middle of the night), it was right in the middle of the day for the [foreign] operations. The aircraft would not 'Auto Initialize', which of course, begins the sequence of automatic data links to the aircraft. After a crew discussion, the consensus was to manually input the route.The entire crew was present, and coordinated the correct loading of the route. It was then discussed, that the weights would not data link, as well as any performance information. Ultimately, we were shut down until the data link came back up. Eventually, the system slowly returned, but in a very reduced capacity. The auto init function was utilized, as well as all the performance information: the predicted takeoff data, final weights, and final takeoff data. As a side note, the flying FO (First Officer), did the load at the gate, and the final load after engine start. After a normal takeoff and climb, FO went to crew rest, as he was the Flying Pilot. FO relief pilot took the right seat. Near the fir boundary, at cruise altitude, the Center Controller told us that the ADS-B info did not match our flight number. The language barrier was significant, as this was not a typical ATC conversation, and several attempts were made to confirm what the problem was. After investigating several areas where we may have had a disconnect, I believe that we realized the flight number that would normally have data-linked to the route page was empty. We then consulted the [stored information] to determine the correct format for that input. Initially, I believe we input Aircraft Y, rather than Aircraft X. After the flight info was input, we received no other notification of the flight number mismatch, and assumed that the problem had been corrected. It is my understanding that was the case. In any case, the system reset caused us a great deal of trouble, both here and three days later when conducting the last flight of the trip pairing. Automation is a sensational thing when it works correctly.				B777 Captain reported having problems with the aircraft data link resulting in their flight number not matching with Foreign ATC displays.

At the top of descent, Captain flying, the Captain's airspeed started to roll back and the auto throttles started to move forward as the aircraft started down. We subsequently received 'IAS disagree' annunciations. Captain performed the memory items for airspeed unreliable and we leveled out. As a crew we determined that the FO (First Officer) and standby airspeed were matched, and asked ATC to confirm our ground speed because the wind readout seemed erroneous. We maintained our filed route. We advised ATC, maintained our filed route and continued to ZZZ. ZZZ1 was not an option with the 1/16 mile reported fog. We did not feel comfortable returning to ZZZ2 with the severity of the situation, not knowing if the FO's side would possibly fail. We had to manage the QRH, start down, [and] change the approach from the RNP to the LDA as we would have 1 FD for the approach. While continuing the descent the Captain's airspeed bled to 45 kts. and the airplane cycled through its aural warnings but we never received the stick shaker. While on the arrival and approach the weather was fluctuating from 10SM to 1 3/4 due to a fog bank. The rapidly changing weather conditions were not helpful but we prepared for a possible go around by briefing the go around pitch and power settings. We were able to pick up the field about 6 miles out and landed uneventfully with the FO flying.We have practiced this scenario in the simulator [which] provided valuable experience to deal with the scenario in real life.		We experienced a failure of the Captain's airspeed indicator. We had begun our descent, with the Captain flying, when we both got 'Unreliable Airspeed' annunciations. We complied with the memory items of the QRC but did not set a pitch power setting as we knew the aircraft was at a safe altitude and airspeed. We quickly determined that the FO (First Officer) and standby airspeed indicators were matched up, and confirmed that our ground speed matched what ATC was reading. I would say the training in this very scenario in the simulator was very helpful to practice for the rare chance that it happens in real life.		B737-700 flight crew reported a safe landing following the failure of the Captain's airspeed indicator.

We tried both PF (Pilot Flying) and PNF (Pilot not Flying) side to make sure. We followed the QRH and worked the problem with the QRH. CA (Captain) transferred controls to me while the CA got together with Dispatch, Flight Attendants and ATC for our return to ZZZZ. We could manually trim the airplane for the return flight and uneventful landing back in ZZZZ. [Priority handling was requested]. The CRM between the whole crew and ATC was great.		I received an ACARS from the crew shortly after departure from ZZZZ1/ZZZZ. They informed me: 'STAB TRIM NOT WORKING - WENT THROUGH QRH NQRH DID NOT FIX - MAY BE GOING BACK TO ZZZZ.'I quickly asked if they want to troubleshoot with Maintenance Control - Answered with a 'CALL ME' request - I sent them a Call ME via ACARS to dial up on XXX.X. Then I noticed they were at FL140 and sent the crew a message regarding that - we may have difficulty connecting below FL200. We were then connected via ZZZ ARINC. I quickly tried to get Maintenance Control on the line to try and trouble shoot the situation. I called Maintenance Control using the standard method - Maintenance Control/Maintenance button - 737 - Maintenance Control AIR FRAME 737. The system then dialed in and requested I punch in the nose number. After that, I told the system that it is an airframe issue. The phone started ringing and ringing, but no answer. After about a minute or so unanswered, I became frustrated and hung up to dial the Maintenance Control PRIORITY Button. There was no answer at this number either. In a panic now because I may have an inflight emergency and the crew are waiting on a radio, not knowing what is going on or whether or not I am still connected. After trying the Priority number once more and it ringing another 30 seconds, I finally get an answer. However, the Maintenance Control Controller that answered the phone was not a 737 Controller, it was a 767 Controller. He wanted to transfer me, but I told him that I may have an inflight emergency and that I needed immediate connection to someone that can trouble shoot with the crew, and that I previously called the 737 Air Frame desk to no answer. He then offered to connect to the crew. He informed the crew that he was a 767 Controller, and that he worked on 737 in the past. After a brief troubleshooting - we were all in agreement that crossing the [area] with this malfunction was not safe and we decided to divert back to ZZZZ1/ZZZZ. The crew then [requested priority handling]. I went through the normal diversion checklist and sent the crew landing data. We were landing heavy, but the crew stated they were flying a wider route to land just under MAX landing weight. The flight landed safely in ZZZZ1/ZZZZ - however the Maintenance Control response was unacceptable. Thankfully this time there was adequate time to troubleshoot, but precious minutes were unnecessarily wasted trying to connect Maintenance Control with the flight, and when we finally did get a connection, it was a Controller from a different fleet. Had this been a more time sensitive emergency, there may not have been adequate time to relay the necessary information to conclude with a safe operation. The response time may be because the Maintenance Control controllers are working from home - there is obviously decreased situational awareness as my call went unanswered in an emergency situation. This has happened several times in the past to other Dispatchers and in the name of safety needs to be addressed immediately.The Captain later called me to express his concern with the Maintenance Control response and we both thought it was in the best interest for the safety of this airline that we both file a safety report concerning the Maintenance Control response to this situation.		Flight Crew and Dispatcher reported communications issues after the Flight Crew elected to perform an air turn back caused by trim failure.

A few minutes later the light illuminated again. At this point we were able to determine it was the OVHT/DET indication on the recall pad. Indication remained for only a few seconds then extinguished again. All engine indications were normal. A short time later the engine fire warning system illuminated along with the fire warning bell. The number one engine light was illuminated. This indication only lasted for about 2 seconds then extinguished. Again, all engine indications appeared normal. I directed the First Officer to fly the airplane and communicated with ATC while I reviewed the engine fire checklist. At this point however, all indications were normal. Considering all factors, including destination, night time, sporadic and intermittent nature of the warnings, I elected to return to ZZZ after conferring with my First Officer. We elected to accept an overweight landing rather than risk the warning returning during a hold while trying to burn fuel. After reviewing the overweight landing procedure we elected to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ. Approach and arrival was fully briefed, Flight Attendants were advised of the situation, as well as passengers. I elected to perform the landing as my First Officer was on his second day of IOE. I then took control of the aircraft and landed on Runway XXR. Landing weight was approximately 154,000 lbs, and landing was very soft. After turning off runway we stopped and had crash fire/rescue visually confirm there were no fire indications either with brakes or engines. We then proceed to the gate and deplaned normally. All defects were submitted via ACARS ELB.				Captain reported receiving engine overheat and fire warning system indications which resulted in return to departure airport.

We then encountered what felt like a strong vibration from the right side as well. At almost the same time that this was happening we received a call from the Flight Attendants who reported hearing loud banging coming from the right side of the aircraft. The only indication from the engine instruments that we observed was the N1 on the #2 engine dropping to approximately 54%. I was the Pilot Flying and disengaged the auto throttles and pulled the #2 thrust lever back until the vibration ceased which was when the thrust lever was at idle. The banging and vibration stopped and the engine seemed to have no further problems at idle. I did attempt one time to increase the thrust but felt the vibration return almost immediately, so I returned it to idle. We [advised] ATC and found that ZZZ was the nearest suitable airport. We requested a lower altitude and were given lower and vectors for ZZZ. I continued to fly the aircraft and the Captain ran the appropriate checklists and coordinated with ATC, Dispatch, the Flight Attendants and Passengers. We requested that ARFF meet us on the runway to inspect the engine. I flew a single engine visual approach to Runway XX at ZZZ and backed it up with the ILS. We stopped the aircraft on the runway and set the brakes. The Captain made the PA to remain seated and AARF came and checked the engine for visible damage or fire. None was detected, so we secured the engine and performed a single engine taxi to the gate with AARF in tow. The passengers were able to deplane via jet bridge. I do not think anything other than the maintenance issue caused the event or my role in the event. I do not think that anything can be done to prevent events like this.		After a step climb from FL340 to FL360, shortly after level off, we observed loud banging and some airframe vibration. The FO (First Officer) was the PF (Pilot Flying) and assumed control of the aircraft. Simultaneously we received a call from the Flight Attendants. They reported banging coming from the right hand side of the aircraft near the #2 engine. We observed that the N1 had dropped to around 45-55% on the #2 engine. The Auto throttle was disengaged and the #2 thrust lever was pulled to idle per the checklist. The engine then ran smoothly. It was determined that the vibration and banging returned when the #2 thrust lever was advanced beyond idle. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested a lower altitude. We then requested a diversion to ZZZ, the nearest suitable airport. While the FO flew, I completed the necessary checklists, communicated with ATC, the company, the passengers and the flight attendants. We made a visual, single engine approach to Runway XX and stopped the aircraft on the runway. ARFF observed the aircraft and saw no signs of fire or severe damage so we secured the #2 engine and single engine taxied to the gate. Passengers deplaned normally via the jet bridge and we rebooked on a later flight.		Flight Crew reported engine vibration and RPM decay resulted in a diversion and precautionary landing.

Upon inspection of the overhead panel, the 'Standby Power Off' light, both 'Pack Lights', and all three 'Zone Temp' lights were illuminated. QRH procedures were completed but all the lights remained illuminated. Then an observation of zero indication was noticed on the brake pressure gauge and PA comms/intercoms with the flight attendants were lost. Communications and intentions were (and had to be) completed in person with the Purser and to all the passengers. [Priority handling was requested] by the Captain and out of precaution (Concern of pressurization loss) a descent to FL250 was initiated. After communication/coordination between the flight deck crew, Dispatch and Company Maintenance, it was established that circuit breaker 'Bat Bus Sect 2' behind the First Officer seat had popped. With further discussion between Dispatch and Maintenance, a diversion to ZZZ was decided as best course of action. At about 20NM North of the ZZZZZ fix the diversion to ZZZ was initiated. Landed in ZZZ uneventfully.		During cruise flt at FL 330 we heard a pop and noticed that the mode control panel ELEC for the Standby Pwr Off and Air Cond light for both Pack lights and all three Zone Temp lights were illuminated. All appropriate checklists and procedures were accomplished. We then talked to ATC, Dispatch, Maintenance Control and the Purser. The Batt Bus Sect # 2 circuit breaker had tripped. Both the cockpit and the cabin PA systems were now also inoperative so our discussion with the Purser was in person and he had to relay my  briefing to the Passengers. Also our break pressure gauge was now reading 0 PSI but Maintenance said is do to the tripped circuit breaker and also that on landing one of our reverses may not deploy. As Captain, I [requested priority handling] and descended from FL 330 to FL 250 for a possible divert and pressurization issue and to burn fuel for landing weight considerations. After our discussions with Dispatch and Maintenance Control we thought it was best to divert. Our diversion and landing in ZZZ was uneventful.		First Officer reported a tripped circuit breaker caused a diversion and precautionary landing.

The First Officer was pilot flying so I answered the call.  The F4 informed me that they were experiencing a fumes event and that the F3 had passed out while exiting the lavatory. (The First Officer and myself were not experiencing any smells or odors). I informed the F4 that we were only about 7 miles from the airport and that we would be on the ground in less than five minutes. I asked the F4 if we needed medical personnel to meet us he said not at that time and that the F3 was conscious.  We were next to land I did not declare an emergency and we did not contact med link.  After landing and taxing clear of the runway and after completing the after landing checklist I asked the First Officer to call the back and get an update on the F3 and see if we need medical personnel to meet us. The First Officer called back to the inflight and spoke with the F4 who was standing next to the F3 and we both could hear the F3 saying she didn't require or want any medical assistance on arrival. Upon gate arrival we deplaned the 40 customers and no one mentioned smelling anything. After all the customers were off the plane I took the Cabin Odor Report Form to the cabin and discussed the event with the inflight crew. They informed me at that time that they started smelling something shortly after we were descending below 10,000ft. The smell was most noticeable from the emergency exits aft. The F3 had been in the aft lavatory and upon exiting she said she took three deep breaths and then the other flight attendants say she passed out, however the F3 said she only felt light headed but never passed out.  During this discussion I was informed that the inflight crew had asked a Deadheading flight attendant to occupy the F3's jumpseat position during landing. After completing the Cabin Odor form I contacted our Dispatcher and Maintenance Control and the duty Chief Pilot. The flight attendants contacted Med Aire and Med Aire advised 3 of the 4 flight attendants to go to the emergency room to get checked out before they would release them to fly again.				Air Carrier Captain reported during final descent being notified by F/A 4 that F/A 3 had lost consciousness temporarily due to fumes in the aft cabin. Upon gate arrival Captain submitted a fume report to Maintenance and Flight Attendant crew received Medical evaluation.

Dark aircraft upon arrival, started APU and used APU bleed and packs at gate. Shortly after takeoff, both the FO (First Officer) and I began smelling a 'dirty sock' odor coming from the vents in the cockpit.  This began faintly and became stronger for a few minutes.   I went on oxygen intermittently and the odor was mostly gone by the time we were climbing through 10,000 MSL.   I asked the inflight crew if they had detected anything in the cabin and they had not.  We notified Dispatch and Maintenance Control and were requested to continue to ZZZ1.  Strong 'dirty sock' odor returned in descent at approximately FL 230.  Persisted for approximately 10 minutes.   PACK 1 was turned off which seemed to help some.  However, odor came back strong again a few minutes later even with PACK 1 off.  The FO and I again used oxygen intermittently.   Odor mostly dissipated prior to landing. Airbus Cabin Odor Reporting Form completed.  The aircraft has a history of APU auto-shutdowns:  no less than five in the last few weeks.				Air Carrier Captain reported a fume event localized to the flight deck during initial climb which dissipated  and resumed during descent. After troubleshooting and conferring with Maintenance the flight continued to destination.

This discrepancy was reported to Maintenance and signed off before pushback. The takeoff, climb, and initial phase of cruise were all routine with the exception of slightly more turbulence than normal - nothing more than continuous light and occasional moderate, resulting in the seat belt sign being illuminated slightly longer and the FAs (Flight Attendant) being seated a bit more than normal. West of [the] river, the ride had smoothed out considerably, [so the] seat belt sign [was] off, and flight conditions became VMC.At FL360 approximately 200 NM east of ZZZ, we observed a G RSVR LO LVL ECAM. After running the complete ECAM, the CA (Captain), pilot monitoring, broke out the QRH and reviewed the entire procedure, including all of the INOP systems; most notably: GREEN HYD, SPLR 1+5, N/W STRG, NORM BRK, L/G RETRACT and REVERSER 1. We discussed the ramifications of continuing to ZZZ1 and after consulting Maintenance Control and Dispatch, decided that [requesting priority handling] with ATC and diverting to ZZZ would be the best and safest course of action. Our assumption was that there was a leak in the green hydraulic system as the HYD page indicated almost no fluid remaining in the green system. We were below max landing weight, so we accepted vectors onto the ZZZZZ Arrival and subsequently requested Runway XXL based upon the runway length. We calculated our landing distance to be approximately 6,000 ft. and Dispatch backed us up by calculating a stopping distance of 6,790 ft. Once coordination with Dispatch and Maintenance Control were completed, we ensured all applicable checklists were completed and briefed ATC, the FAs, and the passengers. We elected for the CA to take over as the pilot flying, and I assumed the duties of pilot monitoring during the arrival. We also elected to start the APU.When we were both comfortable with the state of the aircraft, our plan, and the field conditions, we began slowing the aircraft, configuring, and emergency-extended the landing gear at approximately 20 NM on final to Runway XXL. After executing the L/G Gravity Extension Checklist, we received indications that the gear was down and locked with the gear doors open, as expected. Shortly after extending the landing gear, we noticed blue procedural steps on the STS (Status) page for the approach to turn on both the green hydraulic pump and PTU, both of which we had secured in accordance with the original ECAM. After a brief discussion, we elected to turn both items on. However, within approximately one minute, we again saw the G RSVR LO LVL ECAM and promptly secured the green hydraulic pump and PTU in accordance with the ECAM at approximately 10 miles on final with the gear extended. Prior to touchdown, I made the PA call to "brace, brace, brace" followed by a "remain seated, remain seated" call as we approached a safe taxi speed on the runway after touchdown. The landing was uneventful and we ended up stopping on centerline using emergency brakes around the 7 board, 9,000 lb. remaining. After the crash crew inspected the aircraft and reported fluid under the #1 engine, Company Maintenance evaluated the aircraft, pinned the landing gear, and initiated a tow to the gate. We executed the Tow-In Procedure and multiple PA announcements were made to keep the passengers in the loop with what was going on prior to and during the tow.		While cruising at FL360 to the east of ZZZ, an ECAM message stating HYD G RSVR LO LVL appeared on the upper ECAM. The FO (First Officer) was pilot flying, so I told him he had the controls and the radios, and I would handle the ECAM. I followed the ECAM and turned the PTU (Power Transfer Unit) and Green ENG 1 Pump off. While running the ECAM we noticed a few things; the PTU, prior to being turned off, had been automatically deactivated and the G HYD System was completely empty. Prior to our flight the system was at a nominal level, so we suspected a leak somewhere in the system. After completing the ECAM I referenced the QRH to see if anything was missed. I told the FO I was going to the number 2 radio to talk to Dispatch and Maintenance Control [and] used ACARS. A few minutes later I was conversing with Dispatch and Maintenance Control on XXX.XX MHz. Maintenance Control confirmed that HYD G RSVR LO showed on his side. At this point we were still east of ZZZ and throughout the flight I checked weather at airports in case of an emergency. Because of the massive low-pressure system moving across the US, many airfields east of ZZZ had low visibility, gusty winds, and blowing snow. The safest alternate was ZZZ and we, Dispatch and I, decided to divert there and not continue to ZZZ1. I did not know why the G System emptied and did not want to continue across the [mountains] where airfields are scarce, and possibly have another hydraulic issue and be down to one system. I asked Dispatch to check my performance calculations that I had originally given him, and [to] send an ACARS when he had done so. I told Dispatch I was about to [request priority handling] and start the divert to ZZZ. He and Maintenance Control had nothing else for me so we signed off. At this point I rallied with FO and told him we would now [request priority handling] and begin our divert to ZZZ. The FO was still pilot flying and primary on the radios. My FO is a probationary pilot so I told him specifically how to [request priority handling] and the information ATC would require. He did a fine job doing that as I listened in on the #1 radio. I did not want my FO to feel overwhelmed so I stayed with him in order to get the FMGC (Flight Management and Guide Computer) squared away for the divert. Once that was complete and the aircraft headed towards ZZZ, I told him I needed to talk to the FAs (Flight Attendant) and passengers. He was instructed, prior to any altitude changes, to confirm with me first.My brief with the Purser was concise and he received all necessary information. I had the FAs prep the cabin for evacuation in the event something went terribly wrong; the Purser had no questions. The passengers were then briefed on the situation. After FA and passenger briefs were completed, I rallied again with the FO. We were now in the descent, via the ZZZZZ Arrival. We requested the longest available runway at ZZZ, XXL, and told ATC to standby because we still had a few things to accomplish. I gave the FO a brief review of the situation [and] we reviewed all information that is required prior to running the descent checklist: approach, how it is to be flown, etc. We also reviewed how we would fly a go-around, if required with the gear extended. A brief was also given on a worst-case scenario vs. best-case. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best was our approach to this situation.I told my FO, a very good pilot, that I would land the plane because I wanted the responsibility. We configured 20 miles out in order to give us time to extend the flaps / gear and run the Landing Gear Extension QRH. Since we were underweight yet still had the fuel to do so, I asked for a quick delaying turn to assure we had all checklists complete and the cabin was secured / ready. We made a successful landing on XXL, stopping with at least 8 - 9,000 ft. ahead of us. Thirty seconds out I had the FO make the Brace Call. At a slow speed the FO announced, "Remain seated, remainseated," and we came to a stop. Since the APU was running, I told the FO to secure the engines so that ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) could approach and inspect the aircraft. Operations stated that a large puddle of fluid was beneath the Number 1 engine, and fluid up near the left engine pylon. There were no fire indications so we stood by and waited for our tow to the gate.While the outcome was successful there was one issue I did not expect. After dropping the gear via the Landing Gear Extension Checklist, the "Blue to Do" prompted us to turn the G Eng Pump back on. I did not expect that. My first assumption was why should we do that when the system is completely empty, but we followed the procedure. A few seconds later the ECAM sounded with the original message we got at cruise. I had the FO turn the pump back off.		A320 flight crew reported loss of the green hydraulic system resulted in a diversion and precautionary landing.

Both of the items soon disappeared, but we were able to briefly smell a exhaust type smell briefly in the cockpit as well. As we started the descent into ZZZ1 and the power levers retarded to idle thrust, the odor returned and was reported by the rear FA's but without a haze report this time. The odor was faintly noticeable in the cockpit and would dissipate quickly once the power levels were returned to a greater than idle power setting. After landing and upon gate arrival, I consulted with the FA's and decided the aircraft was to be written up for a smoke/odor/fume event. The FA's met with their respective Flight Service managers and were evaluated by EMT's at the airport. The EMT's instructed the FA's to seek further medical attention. At that point, the FA's left the airport for the hospital to be further evaluated. The FO (First Officer) and I decided that we did not need medical attention. Our aircraft was taken out of service and eventually cancelled due to lack of cabin crew.The aircraft had been sitting in ZZZ for 24 hours with constant rain. My guess is certain areas that get hot following application of bleed air may have steamed off latent oil and/or other fluids that may have been ingested into the packs.[I suggest] more aircraft maintenance that revolves around preventative care of the aircraft.				Air Carrier Captain reported being notified by the flight attendants of a 'chemical/exhaust' odor after departure. The fumes dissipated after a brief period only to resume during descent. Flight Attendants received medical evaluation after the flight.

Weather was 1800 overcast, and the RNAV to [Runway] XXL was programmed in the box. The brief was to be below the weather at the FAF, and do the visual backed up by the RNAV. Tailwind from the west for descent. It was a very busy sector and the Controller overshot us to the east on final and gave us a 330 vector to get back to final. Once on final, the Tower had said we would break out at 600 ft, which I could see as a scattered deck. I reset the minimums before the FAF and started down. When I broke out of all the clouds, I could see I was low on [the] glidepath, and I leveled off to intercept the glidepath and landed. Tower gave us a check altitude call, as I was in the process of correcting.What I should have done, was to realize how task saturated that segment of the approach was, realize I was not properly set up for the RNAV approach and executed a go-around and get set up properly.   With all of the vectors and speed changes, it was unrealistic to fly the full RNAV approach. We were only going to get the final approach section.  I was using Level Change to manage the descent with the tailwind.  VNAV would have worked much better to adapt to changing conditions.		ZZZ to ZZZ1. Briefed 'Visual to [Runway] XXL, back up with RNAV'. Radio very congested and descent tailwind resulted in late and slightly high turn to final for RNAV. Cleared for approach. Tower said 'cleared to land, should breakout at 600 feet' and we reset bugs to DA and noted Missed Approach procedure in the FMC. As Pilot Monitoring, I responded to FAF callout 'ZZZZZ 1600', and we started down to DA. We broke out of the clouds and could see we were low on the VASI glidepath. I stated this just prior to ZZZ1 Tower making a 'check altitude' call and the First Officer was already making a correction. We resumed normal glidepath and the remainder of the flight was uneventful.As Pilot Monitoring, I was distracted by the unexpected low ceiling and did a poor job verifying proper mode selection and monitoring expected descent rate. I should have directed a go-around, at the realization that we were in Level Change and not VNAV.		Air Carrier flight crew reported receiving a low altitude alert from tower during visual approach while in the process of correcting to glidepath.

The smell was overwhelming and similar to dirty socks or mildew. There was a noticeable change in my thoughts from a relaxed and reactively mindset to a distracted, intense and concerned state.Due to our proximity to airport and the fact that we were being vectored to final approach, we did not reference any manuals. Landing the aircraft immediately was my focus. We did attempt to limit the infusion of fumes by turning off Pack 1. That did not make any noticeable difference. We then turned Pack One on and turned off Pack Two. That did not make any noticeable difference. We then turned on Pack Two. Prior to landing, I believe both pilots were responding at a different rate than normal. At one point I called for flaps or landing gear and did not received a response from the First Officer. When I looked over at him, his eyes were closed. I repeated the command and he opened his eyes and did the required task. Shortly afterward, Approach Control ordered a frequency change. The First Officer responded by moving his hand and pulling the transmit button and making the read back, however his hand was not on the side stick. I told him and he then repeated the callback normally. We landed shortly afterward. On the way to the gate, the First Officer seemed to be operating much slower and appeared slightly confused on during our short taxi to the gate.After arriving at the gate, there was a temporary fogginess to my thoughts. Everything I did had a slower and sloppier feel to it. I had to concentrate much more in order to accomplish routine things. The mechanic told me there were 'several' write ups in the logbook for fume events. I was not aware of this. The [Operations Control] Duty Chief told me that there were no write ups in the last 25 flight cycles. I've heard that over servicing of oil can create fumes events, so it might be important to note that a weekly inspection was accomplished prior to our flight.After leaving the aircraft, I ate some food and drank a lot of water. The fogginess seemed to lift after a period of time. The First Officer also ate some food and appeared to recover his normal level of alertness.				Air carrier Captain reported a fume event during final descent which had a serious physiological affect on flight crew's clear thinking and coordination during landing. Captain debriefed with maintenance after a safe arrival and stated the fogginess was temporary.

In cruise at FL370, we received the 'COM Single PTT(Press To Talk) Stuck' ECAM. This was accompanied by 'HF 1 Transmitting' and 'VHF 1 Transmitting' in orange. We completed and cleared the 'COM Single PTT Stuck' ECAM a few times, but it would return again within a minute, so we eventually left it displayed. The 'HF 1 Transmitting' and 'VHF 1 Transmitting' messages came and went randomly for most of the rest of the flight. FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying) this leg and he remained so through the eventual landing.Additional indications:Unable to transmit or receive via any means. VHF, HF, SATCOM, INT, and CABIN on all ACPs (Audio Control Panels) were all completely inoperative. (No radio transmissions received on any radio for the rest of the flight.)The SATCOM screen on the MCDU (Multi-Function Control and Display Unit) flickered, and it switched rapidly back and forth between 'ready' and 'dialing.'There was loud pulsing static in both cockpit speakers, and in the overhead speakers throughout the cabin. (Learned this later in event from flight attendants.)We put on our headsets, but same loud pulsing static was present. Unable to communicate via Interphone (INT). Headphones not used for the rest of the flight.Random orange 'call' light and buzzer from the cabin every 30 seconds for first few minutes of the event, then it stopped. Later determined to be spurious - cabin was not calling during that time.We tried to call the cabin but the 'CABIN' ACP function was inoperative. EMER Cabin Call tried but also inoperative.We sent an initial ACARS message to Dispatch that we had lost all comms. We set the squawk to 7600.We ensured all green TX buttons were deselected on all three ACPs. We used the overhead ACP switching panel to see if we could gain comms via ACP 3 on either the Captain or FO side of the airplane. No change to the above list of indications. In fact, when we tried to engage any green TX button on any ACP, it would extinguish by itself after 2-3 seconds. If any ACP listening button was raised (white) we heard either the pulsing static or nothing. Observer hand mic and headset tried - no change. These were then unplugged. Both RMPs (Radio Management Panels) were switched off for a minute, and then back on. No changes.At this point we were out of ideas and outside the QRH, so I made a WiFi call on my personal phone to Dispatch. My airborne WiFi phone call was made via a wireless ear bud in my left ear only, so I could hear the FO with my right ear and keep both hands free to fully attend to my duties as PM (Pilot Monitoring).I explained our situation via phone call to Dispatch and they immediately conferenced in Maintenance. We spent at least 15-20 minutes on the phone with Maintenance trying to find any reset or other action that would restore comms. The only viable airborne reset found was for FWC (Flight Warning Computer) 1 and FWC 2. Maintenance directed us to try those resets, but there was no change, except to also knock ACARS offline for the rest of the flight. ATC was conferenced into the phone call, and they provided holding instructions over ZZZ at FL370.We were only able to communicate with the flight attendants by passing notes on paper back and forth under the cockpit door. We wrote to them to knock if they had an urgent need. I tried the cockpit PA handset and miraculously it did work. PA's were able to 'break through' the static on the cabin speakers, so I was able to make PA's to the cabin to keep the flight attendants and customers informed of the situation.In coordination with Dispatch and Operations Control, the decision was made to divert to ZZZ1. Dispatch requested priority handling for the flight and we concurred. Dispatch conferenced ATC in on my phone call again, and clearance to ZZZ1 was provided via the phone call. As we began the divert towards ZZZ1, the F1 knocked on the door. I looked through the peep hole and saw two flightattendants but no cart. We had only 42 passengers on board and I saw all were seated. Based on our agreement that a knock meant an urgent need, and the fact we had begun the divert and time was limited, I exercised my Captain's authority and opened the cockpit door to let the F1 into the cockpit. She communicated that the customers had 'seen our flight turn red on FlightAware/FlightRadar24' and were growing concerned. I was able to show her what we were dealing with in the cockpit. I also told her we had just turned towards ZZZ1 and would land in approximately 25 minutes. She understood the situation and the plan, and she returned to the cabin.Via PA, I advised the Customers of the divert to ZZZ1 and that we expected a normal landing and taxi to the gate. Further clearance for the approach and landing were passed to us from ATC via the WiFi phone call. At top of descent I asked for a follow-me truck to guide us on the ground to the gate. Landing and taxi in to the gate were normal. Follow-me truck was waiting for taxi in as requested. Logbook write-up made. Thorough verbal debrief completed with ZZZ1 Maintenance personnel.				A320 Captain reported a stuck Press To Talk button hampered communications, requiring a divert and precautionary landing.

We completed QRH procedures which directed us to place the FLT CTRL B switch to RUD STBY. This also created additional failures in Diff Feel and Yaw Damper Fail. We also noticed that 'A' system hydraulic fluid appeared to be decreasing. Since we were not yet halfway and about to go on a portion of our trip completely over water for approximately 500 miles, we elected to turn around to divert back to ZZZ. We considered diverting 300 miles to ZZZ1 and looked at other potential diversion points on the return to ZZZ. We were going to be approximately 2,000 pounds overweight, so we [requested priority handling] in accordance with the FOM and company policy. During the approach the flight controls were sluggish. The approach and landing were completed per the 737 QRH Overweight Landing Checklist, and an overweight landing entry made in addition to the SYS B Failure in the a/c logbook.Suggestions - I think the 737 QRH needs to be reviewed for additional steps on this item. Very brief. Doesn't mention that follow on failures will occur including loss of Yaw Damper and Feel Diff. Additionally there is no information in QRH Overweight Landing Checklist that indicates[requesting priority handling] is required per company policy.				B737-800 Captain reported a flight control system malfunction and hydraulics system quantity decreasing made flight control sluggish during cruise. The crew decided to return to the departure airport.

Within moments the Captain initiated the descent using altitude intervene. We were within 50 miles of top of descent and the cruise descent rate initiated at 1000 feet per minute. Within a minute Seattle Center gave us a frequency change and we checked in with a new Controller. Approximately 60 seconds after checking in with the new Controller we observed an Airbus 380 at our 10 o'clock. It had flown across our path from right to left (we were traveling NW bound on the Chins arrival) at what I would guess was FL360. We were descending through an altitude of approximately FL300 when we observed the Airbus 380. About 60 seconds later we encountered residual wake turbulence from the Airbus 380. About 20 seconds later the A Flight Attendant called over the interphone to indicate she may be injured. She requested medical attention upon arrival and after deplaning. Immediately following the Flight Attendant call I informed Seattle Center of the wake turbulence and possible injuries on the aircraft. About 60 seconds later we were contacted by Seattle Center inquiring about the details of our encounter and severity of injuries. I then initiated contact with Dispatch to relay the request for medical attention. I then followed up with Operations when we were on the ground and clear of the runways that medical staff would be present at our gate. Upon arrival at the gate, medical staff was present. Passengers deplaned, and all of the flight attendants requested to be examined by medical staff.Seattle Center never made us aware of the Airbus 380 traffic and because we were in a descent and well below the altitude of the [Airbus] 380, we were not alerted. I will be more vigilant looking for traffic during descents when my vision is blocked by the airframe with pitch attitudes different than cruise. And I recommend extra vigilance by ATC when the Airbus 380 is in the vicinity of other aircraft. They are rare to see and their wake turbulence profile is much larger than even I expected. This event was my first encounter with the Airbus 380.				B737-800 First Officer reported a Flight Attendant was injured during a wake turbulence encounter on descent into SEA in trail of an A380.

We asked ATC for a climb to get above the clouds we were given Flight Level 350. We proceeded to climb to FL350 and turned on the Engine Anti Ice around 270 being in and out of the clouds and the temp was -15C (AT NO time did we ever turn on the Wing Anti Ice). Climbing through FL320 just passed ZZZ1 over the ocean we had a Master Caution/Wing Body Overheat light. I, the Captain, was the Flying Pilot and at once said MY AIRCRAFT and the First Officer got out the checklist to accomplish the Wing Body Overheat emergency/ (my aircraft and radios). The First Officer completed the checklist (did a great job), [received priority] and were going to divert to ZZZ1. After First Officer completed the checklist and the Wing Body Heat light went out we decided to return to ZZZ. ATC gave us direct to ZZZ and I transferred controls to the First Officer and I began to coordinate with ATC, and inform the Flight Attendants, the passengers and Dispatch. While flying back to ZZZ we had to land [overweight]. We chose the longest runway at ZZZ [Runway] XXC and completed the Landing Assessment on the Landing APP, and had plenty of runway to stop the overweight aircraft. Our gross weight on landing XXC ZZZ was 162 kts. and the fuel on board was 30.6k and we landed 40 Flaps 147 knots approach speed. The First Officer landed the aircraft and transferred controls at 60 knots. Exited XXC with no incident and had the Fire Chief take a look at the aircraft on the taxiway. The Fire Chief reported no issues with the aircraft and then taxied back to the gate and filled out the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) with overweight landing and Wing Body Overheat. Thanks for all the ATC controllers help and the emergency personnel. Thanks to the great professionalism of my First Officer and the calmness of our 4 Flight Attendants. Thanks to the Chief Pilot meeting us at the aircraft. Special thanks to all of the training instructors and Check Airmen who prepare us for situations such as the one we experienced.		Event happened on Aircraft X scheduled service from ZZZ to ZZZZ. I was assigned as the Pilot Monitoring for the flight. Preflight, taxi and takeoff were uneventful. Just before leveling off at FL350, we received a Master Caution/Air Cond/Left Wing Body Overheat light. The CA (Captain) kept control of the aircraft and I executed the appropriate QRH procedure. The light eventually went out as we worked through the steps. Due to the nature of the malfunction, we [received priority] with ZZZ2 Center and returned to ZZZ. At the Captain's request, I took over Pilot Flying responsibilities and we had an uneventful overweight landing at ZZZ on Runway XXC where we were met by ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) and escorted to our gate.I do not see any causal factors to this event. We reacted to the system malfunction and utilized our knowledge to safely return the aircraft to ZZZ.This event was a real life example of how our training can successfully play out in the aircraft. We utilized our training experience, to diagnose the issue, make decisions and keep both pilots in the green while we safely and expeditiously landed the aircraft in ZZZ.		B737-800 flight crew reported receiving a wing body overheat warning while in climb and cruise. The pilots, in the interest of safety, elected to make a diversion after completing the QRH procedures.

Above 400 AGL we began ECAM actions, confirmed thrust lever 2 and I pulled it back. Centered the slide slip/beta target. 3 seconds later the ECAM disappeared. ATC told us level 2000, set A/P on and leveled 2000, pulled speed to slightly above green dot. Pulled HDG and turned crosswind. The Captain briefed the flight attendants then passengers. I had loaded the secondary for the ILS XXL in at the gate, so we activated the secondary flight plan. We transferred controls and I briefed the ILS XXL, exchanged back. The Captain noticed Engine #2 N1/N2 were still functional. I slowly added power back in and put #2 in the climb detent. Ran the approach checklist. Once cleared and configured we ran the landing checklist. landed.				A320 Captain reported a fire warning/ECAM/triple chime/Master Caution/Warning and fire handle illuminated on climbout.

This occurred several times and was accompanied by extremely loud mechanical noises which sounded like the nose gear in motion. We suspected that the uplock was not engaging the nose gear. We leveled off and took delay vectors in order to work the issue. First Officer flew the aircraft while I contacted Maintenance through Dispatch via ARINC and came to the conclusion that it was best to return to ZZZ. A return to ZZZ was worked out with ATC. Priority handling was declared by ZZZ Tower. An uneventful landing followed. After landing we had an indication that the left side forward emergency over wing exit had opened. FO (First Officer) told the passengers to remain seated and the aircraft was stopped in order to query the flight attendants on that situation. We were told that the indication was simply from the handle cover falling off. At this point we continued to the gate.				A320 Captain reported a nose gear uplock failure on gear retraction.

I was the PM (pilot Monitoring) and to address the ECAM, I had the FO (First Officer) (PF (Pilot Flying)) take the radios so I could address the ECAM and get in the QRH. Executed the ECAM, and referenced page in the QRH. Based on the landing distance chart, we calculated our landing distance at 3.660 ft, and immediately got both Maintenance and Dispatch in the loop. Dispatch also calculated landing distance and to be conservative, we agreed to use 4,000 ft. A few minutes after accomplishing the QRH, ECAMs complete, screens normal, we then got a L spoiler 3 indicating extended. We notified Dispatch and added the 10% fuel penalty. We landed without incident and upon ZZZ1 Maintenance observation, we were notified that there was hydraulic fluid alongside our entire underbelly, which validates the low level reservoir fluid level for the Blue system.

After saying 'Your Aircraft' to the Captain who was Pilot Flying for this leg and the Captain responding with 'MY AIRCRAFT,' we looked up to the overhead panel and saw the LOW PRESSURE amber light illuminated to the FLT CONTROL B side. I opened the electronic QRH to page X and read the following Condition: 'Hydraulic system pressure to the ailerons. elevators and rudder is low.' After also reading the Objective, we accomplished the only step in the QRH by moving the FLT CONTROL switch on the affected side, after confirmation, to STBY RUD. This action illuminated two other amber lights: YAW DAMPER and FEEL DIFF PRESS. There was no mention in the QRH that these two lights would subsequently light after moving the FLT CONTROL B switch to STBY RUD. After seeing these two additional amber lights, I opened the QRH to review the instructions associated with these 2 amber lights. The FEEL DIFF PRESS QRH step said to continue normal operation but that control column forces may be higher than normal, particularly during the flare. We discussed this as a crew. We then reviewed the YAW DAMPER light QRH steps, followed them and reviewed those instructions as a crew (including not to land with flaps greater than 30 and to avoid moderate or severe turbulence). The YAW DAMPER amber light remained lit after following the QRH steps. After briefly discussing the option to land in ZZZ, the Captain made the decision to return to ZZZ1. I informed ATC of our desire to do a 180 degree turn and return to ZZZ1. The ATC Controller asked why, and I responded, due to a flight control problem. The Controller gave us instructions to turn north and then gave us a clearance to return to ZZZ1. The Controller also asked if we needed further assistance, and I stated not at this time. During the turn back to ZZZ1, it was obvious the YAW DAMPER system was not working as it felt like we would slip and slide through the air in response to every gust of wind. This was even more pronounced on final approach. En route to ZZZ1 we reviewed possible diversion options should we lose hydraulic quantity or pressure but both remained stable, although System A side QTY had reduced to about 80% from 105% at departure. En route, we lowered our altitude to increase fuel burn and reduce fuel on board as much as possible. The APU was also started for that reason. We read the FOM requirements for an overweight landing which clearly state that [priority handling must be requested]. As we checked in with ZZZ1 approach, I [requested priority handling] and our intentions to conduct an overweight landing with a flight control problem in ZZZ1. I asked for Runway XX with no LAHSO (Landing And Hold Short Operations) restriction. The ATC Controller asked for other information like fuel on board in minutes and souls on board. We had XXX souls on board. During final approach the Captain stated the flight controls felt sluggish and I could feel the aircraft slip and slide in the YAW axis. The Captain made a smooth landing at a low vertical rate of descent and we exited the runway and taxied to the gate with no further incident. CFR had been called and they were there along side the runway if needed. Possible blockage in the B side Flight Control Hydraulic lines.No suggestion on how to prevent this, but I would suggest adding additional information to the FLIGHT CONTROL LOW PRESSURE section of the QRH that includes the possibility that the YAW DAMPER and FEEL DIFF PRESS lights could also illuminate and to follow those QRH steps and discuss those flight implications as a crew. The QRH implicitly treats this flight condition as very benign due to the simplicity and lack of info in the QRH for this flight problem. Is a potential blockage in the hydraulic lines to the primary flight controls really a benign condition? A context to the severity or non-severity of this flight condition would be appreciated so that decisions on continuing flight or diverting can be better made.				B737-800 First Officer reported a FLT CONT EICAS light illuminated in cruise. The Flight Crew returned to the departure airport and reported that during landing the flight controls felt sluggish and the aircraft had a yawing motion.

Immediately after takeoff from ZZZ, I (Pilot Flying) realized the electronic trim for the horizontal stabilizer was not working. It was working prior to takeoff and was used to set the proper stab trim. The First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) tried his yoke trim switches, and they also did not work. We ran the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist, which restored our ability to trim the stabilizer using manual trim. A secondary effect of losing electronic elevator trim is also losing the autopilot. We decided the best course of action was to return to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ for an uneventful landing. Airplane was then turned over to Maintenance for repair.No known causal factors. We had been de-iced prior to takeoff, but there is no reason to believe there was any ice buildup or contact with the deicing equipment since the manual trim worked fine.My opinion is this event was the result of a mechanical malfunction. Sometimes complex machines have malfunctions, so I have no suggestions to prevent a similar event in the future.				B737-800 Captain reported stabilizer trim ceased to function after takeoff. The flight crew complied with QRH procedures and regained manual control of stabilizer trim. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and landed at the departure airport.

The flaps began to extend but froze at about 0.5 degrees extension.We told ZZZ Approach that we needed to cancel the approach. ZZZ Approach vectored us north on downwind so we could run the appropriate QRH.We determined the correct QRH in this situation to be: Trailing Edge Flap Disagree - The trailing edge flaps are not in the commanded (flap handle) position. There was no asymmetry. We completed the QRH, landed, and taxied to the gate uneventfully.We are awaiting the cause for the flap extension failure from the maintenance investigation. Practicing flap malfunctions in CQ (Continuing Qualification) definitely helped with the flap failure on this flight. Also it's been great practicing early missed approaches in CQ the past 2 years as I got to apply that training on this flight!		Aircraft X, ZZZ1-ZZZ. While getting vectored for the visual approach to Runway XXR, we were unable to select any flaps for landing. We requested an off localizer vector with ZZZ Approach to handle the abnormal.We executed the ' The Trailing Edge Flap Disagree' abnormal checklist, and landed on [Runway] XXL at ZZZ uneventfully. The approach environment was a bit busy, we were somewhat tight on fuel, and there was someone illuminating aircraft on final approach into ZZZ with a green laser.I made the decision to not delay our arrival by briefing the flight attendants while airborne of the flap situation. My concern was getting the aircraft safely on the ground in a timely manner. After deplaning of our passengers, the First Officer and I had a full debrief with our flight attendants. I explained to them that a flaps 15 landing was flap setting we use under certain circumstances and that it was considered a normal landing configuration. I also informed them why I elected to not brief them airborne as to our abnormal.Logbook was filled out and ZZZ Maintenance was notified. This was reported by phone to the Duty Officer immediately after the flight attendants were debriefed.I did advise with ATC due to the flight control abnormal, the amount of fuel we had, the need to prevent any further delay because of our fuel status, and the fact that we were hoping to prevent illumination by the person using the laser against arriving aircraft. While conducting a visual approach into ZZZ, we were unable to extend normal flaps for landing. I requested priority handling to address the abnormal flaps situation, and landed uneventfully at ZZZ.		B737-900 flight crew reported trailing edge flaps would not move when flap handle was positioned in any setting. The flight crew requested vectors to a new approach and made a precautionary landing at destination airport.

[We requested priority handling] and flew ILS XXL. Taxied back to park.Fatigue. Slept first six hours of 30-hour layover. Attempted to sleep 6 hours prior to alert, was unable to sleep. Release had listed a MEL for "Main Cargo Loading." Upon pushback we got EICAS for "MAIN CARGO DOOR." My fatigue combined with expectation bias led me to direct the FO (First Officer) to override the message - override the checklist. The load crew did not fully close the Main Cargo Door. Maintenance reported "all doors closed and locked" prior to push. We started the left engine, taxied to XXL and started the right engine abeam the terminal. After the initial EICAS, we received no other alerts until the cabin altitude alert.I should have pulled the crew together and reviewed the messages. The load team should have properly closed the door. Maintenance should not have reported "doors closed and locked" when they were not. It seems odd that the takeoff configuration check doesn't incorporate doors; maybe it should. I should have been better aware of my degraded state due to fatigue.		Upon climbout we had a cabin pressurization warning at 10,000 ft. The pressurization didn't go to manual until passing 8,000 ft. and we noticed our cabin pressure was the same as our outside altitude. We were able to level off at 12,000 ft. and eventually descend to 10,000 ft. to get rid of the cabin altitude warning. We elected to return to ZZZ since we weren't pressurizing. Our weight was 595,000 lb. With discussion with the crew, we decided to hold and dump fuel. ZZZZ gave us holding instructions and we dumped fuel for 4 minutes to get on max landing weight. We shot the ILS to XXL and the Captain made the landing. We requested priority handling for priority.Fatigue was not a factor in this event for me. I try to always set myself up to get 8 hours of sleep upon showtime. With a XA:00 van I woke up at XW:00 with 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. We had a standard flight plan with a MEL of [the] Main Cargo Loading system. Everything up to pushback was standard and normal. Upon the pushback is where the confusion happened. The ground crew advised us doors were closed [and] they were ready for push. The Maintenance Guy told us all doors were closed and locked. Before pushback we had a Main Cargo Door message. The Captain elected to cancel the message relating to the MEL. With the MEL being Main Cargo Loading system and a caution message of Main Cargo Door, we had an expectation bias it was part of the MEL. After start-up and a takeoff configuration check, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Pulling up to the gate the ground crew advised us the relief valve on Main Cargo Door was slightly open. We then refueled and proceeded to ZZZ.Expectation bias was the main cause of this event. A confusion of a MEL and what was displayed as a caution message made it seem that both things were related when in fact they weren't. My situational awareness should have been much higher with a better understanding of the MEL. With Maintenance telling us doors were closed and locked we assumed it was related to MEL. We should have slowed down and talked it over better with the crew.		B777-200 flight crew reported that the ground crew did not fully close the main cargo door during loading. This caused a cabin pressurization failure, leading to an air turnback and precautionary landing.

Shortly after that he stated something was wrong and we had an IAS Disagree light. About that time we got a Master Caution light with the Engine light illuminated on the six pack. I quickly scanned the engines and they were good. I then looked at my airspeed and we were past VR and quickly eating up runway. I said Rotate? When I didn't hear anything, and saw how much runway was left, I rotated. The aircraft felt like it was accelerating and I felt comfortable rotating.Once airborne we quickly determined my airspeed was correct (crosschecked standby and ground speed). The Captain's airspeed was initially 20-30 below mine; once airborne it was 5-10 below. The Master Caution light went out sometime on climb out. We cleaned up the aircraft and leveled off at 5,000 feet to run checklists. While running the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist the Master Cation and Engine lights came on again, we scanned the engines and the overhead panel and could not find what was causing the lights. They went out after about 20 seconds.We landed uneventfully back at ZZZ. [The First Officer's response and question] is what caused the Master Caution and Engine lights during this event. Nowhere in the Quick Reference Handbook does it say this could be an indication associated with the airspeed disagree. It was extremely distracting during an already stressful event. I suspect one of the Electronic Engine Control's went into the ALT mode causing it. In any event, the Quick Reference Handbook should add this as a possible indication associated with an IAS disagree.		On takeoff roll, near 90 kts. I noticed my airspeed indicator sluggish, just then First Officer questions 'Rotate?', I looked out the windscreen at the end of the runway approaching quickly and First Officer's and Standby Airspeed Indicator's and stated 'Rotate'. We got airborne and still had a 20-30 kt difference, but we quickly determine it was Captain Airspeed indicator was erroneous. At that point we ran the Airspeed Unreliable Quick Reference Checklist and Quick Reference Handbook cleaned up the Airplane and asked for Vectors to work the problem and talk to company. We use Ops Frequency for a patch to Dispatch for guidance as we're running Performance Weight and Balance landing speeds, Dispatch told us we could land back in ZZZ1 and there was a spare aircraft available.We ran Performance Weight and Balance as well as diversion checklist, and still in the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist. We asked ATC for a return to ZZZ1 and landed with no other problems. Once safely on the ground we ran Brake Cooling, time not required. We had an overweight landing was caused by the Air Return. ZZZ2 was not as Cooperative as I wished they might have been. They asked us to go into a hold, which I declined and asked again for vectors. Then on final and still in Quick Reference Handbook and briefing flight attendants and passengers, ZZZ2 wanted us to go off and pick up new ATIS. I requested the information be read to us, they did eventually give it to us.Maybe I should have declared an emergency as to eliminate the extra threats. Once on the ground or maybe on approach, I'm unsure when it happened, as we were trying to keep from getting a stick shaker on the approach, we received an Engine Master Caution for just a few seconds, or maybe even a minute. I believe the Electronic Engine Control went into Soft Alternate for a moment. When on the ground it went back to Normal Mode. We eventually got a different Aircraft and took off for ZZZ3 with no other issues. [The Captain suggests] pitot covers for Routine Overnight Aircraft in all ZZZ4 locations as I believe this was caused by Mud Daubers building nests in the Pitot Tubes, and I also believe this aircraft had been sitting a few days in ZZZ5.		B737-800 flight crew reported an airspeed unreliable condition during the takeoff roll. The crew stated the condition was near or through Vr (rotation) and they continued. Once airborne the crew completed the QRH and returned to the origin airport.

I advised the FO (First Officer) to be ready for a GA (go around), as ATC queried them to expedite exiting. Approaching threshold they were cleared, at 50 ft., we got his wake and the aircraft veered to the right. I added power, maneuvered back to the center line. As I was thinking of initiating a go-around we were out of it. Under the circumstances, I made a split decision to continue the landing and land. We touched down extremely soft, to the point that it was difficult to recognize, which might have caused me to hold off the nose a bit longer than usual. At this time the RCAS system activated- LONG LANDING LONG LANDING. It was the first time I had heard it and startled us both. I braked, exited runway, taxied to the gate uneventfully. Afterwards we discovered that the preceding aircraft was a B757.	Reporter stated he has had three wake encounters in the DEN area in the last year, with perhaps two in the preceding ten years.

Just climbing through 1,000 feet FO (First Officer) stated 'we've dumped our departure route' out of the box/FMC.  [We responded by] putting in JAMBA, first waypoint on SID, back in box and then KBOLA for now. We began our turn direct JAMBA.MIA Departure Control, very busy, asked 'are you proceeding direct JAMBA?'FO responded, 'yes we are now proceeding direct JAMBA, we've been deviating a little to get out of wake turbulence from heavy aircraft we are following.'Departure Control cleared us continue climb 7,000 ft. speed restriction 250 kts.Just before reaching JAMBA Departure Control cleared us direct to KBOLA.4 NM before KBOLA Departure Control gave us a heading and 250 speed restriction still in effect, after which the remainder of the flight continued uneventfully.[We discussed, as a crew,] how and when we, the FO and me, dumped the SID out of the FMC. At the gate, before push back, with due diligence downloaded our route, departure Runway 8R, SID-KMIA FOLZZ1 FOLZZ, and ATC route clearance amendments FOLZZ DIR ZFP DIR BAAGR DIR GRATX then as filed, manually into the FMC. We then reviewed route and points individually as per normal procedures, all good. On the ATC clearance uplink the amended points came up as FOLZZ-N2617.3W07920.9, ZFP-N2633.3W07841.8, BAAGR-N2649.0W07631.3.

I obviously must have pushed that button. No excuse, as I've read many reports from other professional pilots-colleagues on our team sharing similar events. I respect and thank them for sharing so I wouldn't make this mistake. Some of our pilots, new to aircraft and/or don't fly much, great to review things but, there is the right time and place. My timing was bad to review any FMC operations. I should have checked to see, after my FMC review with the FO, that I hadn't messed up our original route data.

I called back to the Flight Attedent's (FA) to ask if they had any unusual odor in the cabin. They said that they did with a very light haze in the cabin. The FO and I accomplished the QRC for SMOKE, FIRE or FUMES which then lead us to QRH Chapter 8 SMOKE, FIRE or FUMES Checklist. We accomplished steps 1-12. I read step 12 as we had extinguished the source through previous steps. The smell had dissipated as did the haze in the cabin, which in my opinion confirmed that the situation was contained. We then moved to item 13. At that point I contacted Dispatch and informed them of the entire event and discussed with them our options and their preference. I conferred with the FO and all FAs and apprised them that it was my intent to continue on to our destination, but if anyone did not feel comfortable with this decision, that we would divert into ZZZ. At that time we were about 30 minutes east of ZZZ. Dispatch had also said that based on the information that we gave them, and having spoken with Maintenance, asked if we were comfortable to continue to destination. I informed them that we would continue on and would divert to ZZZ if the fumes returned. As I sit and spend more time reading this QRH out of the Cockpit, I could see how maybe we should have have diverted as the smoke, fire or fumes were not 'obvious' although it was obvious through the absence of smell and haze the source was 'isolated and extinguished.'				Air Carrier Captain reported a fume event during cruise. After completing the appropriate QRH procedure and  conferring with Maintenance the flight continued to a safe landing at destination.

On Departure SID, leveled off at FL260, in IMC, TAI (Thermal Anti-Ice) on. Shortly after reaching FL260 we saw IAS DISAGREE on CA (Captain) and FO PFDs (Primary Flight Displays). FO's airspeed read about 25 knots less than CA's. Ran Airspeed Unreliable checklist but could not determine which airspeed, if any, was reliable. No probe heat failure was indicated. FO was hand flying aircraft in IMC at FL260 without AP (Autopilot), AT (Autothrottle) or FD (Flight Director). I decided to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ1. Received vectors back to airport for ILS XXC. Planned overweight landing and ran that checklist too. While on vectors to Runway XXC, the IAS DISAGREE messages disappeared from both PFDs and airspeed indications appeared normal again. Continued to ZZZ1 and landed uneventfully but overweight at 150,500 lbs. Landed smoothly and let airplane roll down runway, ARFF confirmed no hot brakes and followed us to the gate. I checked with one of our Technical Pilots two days later to see if a cause for the IAS DISAGREE had been determined. I was told that the FO's pitot tube had been replaced and the airplane had been returned to service.We were in IMC and icing conditions at the onset of the event but engine anti-ice had been selected on as soon as we entered IMC conditions. Again, no indication of a TAI or probe heat failure. Even though the malfunction cleared during decent while on vectors for the approach, I elected to stay with the plan of returning to ZZZ1 without delay which I had communicated to ATC, Dispatch, the FAs and PAX (Passengers). This report is informational only. I have no suggestions.				B737-800 Captain reported an air turn back after receiving an IAS DISAGREE on both PFD's.

However, the last page, only, of the ECAM Actions for cargo smoke was displayed on the STS (Status) page. Moments later, passing through about 10000 feet the same warning recurred and again stopped and vanished. The STS continued to display the same last page.Since we [were] coasting-out and were unable to determine whether or not we were on fire, and unable to determine if the warning was for the for the forward or aft cargo compartment, I transferred aircraft control and ATC communications responsibilities to the First Officer, with the command to request priority handling and return to the departure airport ASAP.We each completed our divided duties and re-joined as a crew, so to speak, on about a 10 mile final. Although we were about 21,000 pounds above maximum landing weight, First Officer rolled the aircraft onto the runway as smooth as could be and brought us to a stop on the center line. I found the procedure of calling 'My Aircraft' and the onset of both warnings very helpful. And the method of dividing responsibilities, i.e., 'Your aircraft, your radios' to serve us perfectly as well.		During climbout, we received a Cargo Smoke master warning and ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor), which went away after a few seconds. Same Warning and ECAM reappeared and went away again after a couple minutes. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZZ. Performed an overweight landing (approximately 163,000 pounds) IAW QRH procedures. Captain coordinated with local ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting Foam), Maintenance, and Ops, and made AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) entry.		A320 flight crew received a Cargo Smoke Warning ECAM and elected to perform an air turn back and overweight landing at departure airport.

Approaching 5 miles, with gear down and approximately 170 kts., I called for flaps 25 and 30, but the flaps did not move from flaps 15 when the CA (Captain) moved the lever. We accomplished a Normal go-around and I called for flaps 15. After calling for clean maneuvering speed, I called for flaps 5, but the flaps did not move from 15. I reduced power and we set MCP speed below max flap 15 speed. The Captain ran the checklist and we coordinate our plan to land and advised ATC. We landed without incident and had Operations 1 and Fire/rescue look over the plane, then taxied to the gate.I think we handled the emergency well, especially with the all the distractions from ATC, warning horn with gear up and flaps stuck at 15 after go-around, and shifting winds on final.		We were on a visual final to ZZZ Runway XXC with the First Officer as PF (Pilot Flying). After selecting flaps to 30, we noticed the Trailing Edge Flap Indicator still indicated Flaps 15. We executed a go-around. Per our go-around call outs, the flap handle was brought to 15, then 5. We then noted the flap indicator still indicated 15.While being vectored for another visual approach to Runway 1C, I ran the Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree Checklist. The First Officer put the autopilot back on and maintained 185 KIAS to stay below the Flaps 15 limit speed.Before our turn to Final, I requested priority handling with ZZZZ Approach, telling them we had 5,800 lbs of fuel (approximately 58 minutes) and XXX souls on board. I made a quick PA to the passengers. Also, I let the flight attendants know we were returning for a normal landing with a flap problem. Per the QRH, we made an uneventful Flaps 15 visual approach and landing. The First Officer did the landing. An ELB report was made once we were at the gate.I believe we handled the event pretty well. The FO (First Officer) and I had great communication. The First Officer also did well with automation management which greatly helped with the workload. I did not notify Dispatch or Maintenance in the air since we wanted to complete our checklist and land in a timely fashion. Looking back, I should have used the [checklist] sequence with my communication with the flight attendants. I conveyed the information to them, but I know using the checklist would insure that we are all on the same page.		B737 NG reported a go-around caused by flaps failing to extend to the commanded position. The flight crew elected to fly the approach again and perform a precautionary landing.

AGL on departure, Windshear Alert activated for about three to five seconds. Captain initiated windshear escape maneuver. Alert disappeared just as suddenly as it appeared. Continued with cutback procedure, once windshear event was over. Suspect that it was due to close proximity of aircraft that had departed just prior to our flight and we were actually encountering a portion of his wake. No adverse control inputs or turbulence was experienced.		We were taking off out of SNA and ready to do the standard (Company) cutback procedures for Runway 20R.  At 600' AGL, the F/O stated 'approaching cutback'. At about 700' AGL we received the Windshear Warning, both aural and on the instruments.  I disconnected the autothrottles (the autopilot was not engaged) and added power.  The Windshear Warning only lasted about two or three seconds. The aircraft flew perfectly smooth throughout this event. We believe it was an erroneous indication- winds were calm and there were no wind shifts or any weather in the area. There was an aircraft that took off just prior to us, but we did not even feel his wake turbulence. We are filing this report because rather than reducing the throttles to the cutback power setting, we were actually forced to add power to the Windshear Procedures.		B737-700 First Officer reported receiving a wind shear alert departing SNA that may have been a wake turbulence encounter.

We waited a few seconds and a second blue ECAM directed us to turn CTR TANK 2 off and open the XFEED, which we did. We pulled up the fuel page and noticed a 1,400 pound imbalance which is also normal. We continued watching the fuel page and noticed the imbalance rapidly getting worse. We consulted the FM to fuel imbalance and followed the procedure, which was to turn tank 1 off, open XFEED and tank 2 should balance out tank one. The fuel imbalance started increasing at a rapid rate. Tank 2 went UP in fuel while tank one was falling rapidly, now approaching 3,000 pounds lower. I called Dispatch and had him connect me with M/C (Maintenance Control). M/C did not have a solution that we had not already tried. Suspecting a fuel leak, we made the decision to divert to ZZZ. I notified the passengers and flight attendants and we diverted to ZZZ. The fuel imbalance continued to get worse and the autopilot eventually had 3.2 degrees of right rudder in with left bank to keep us flying straight and level. We landed ZZZ and requested ARFF assistance to verify we did not have a fuel leak before taxing to the gate.		During cruise flight we received an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) from low pressure from one of the center tank pumps. The tank was at 40 pounds so we believed the message would disappear however it did not. We proceeded to run the ECAM and at the conclusion we identified a 1,400 lbs fuel imbalance which is not abnormal. However, this fuel imbalance rapidly increased approaching our structural limitations. The Captain initiated the fuel imbalance QRH procedure after consulting the FM and communicated with M/C (Maintenance Control). M/C did not have any suggestions we had not attempted. We investigated whether this could be a false reading but determined it was a true imbalance due to the aircraft slowly entering a small bank with rudder trim while in level flight. Due to a possibility of a fuel leak, the aircraft uncoordinated flight condition and the uncorrectable fuel imbalance the captain elected to divert to ZZZ. We landed uneventfully in ZZZ and had ground ops trucks inspect the aircraft for a fuel leak before continuing to our gate. No leak was found.		A320 flight crew reported a diversion caused by a rapidly changing fuel imbalance.

Passing 9000 feet we got a battery discharge light. We ran QRH which directed us to land at nearest suitable airport. After coordinating with ATC, Dispatch, our crew and passengers, we returned to ZZZ, where we swapped planes and continued to ZZZ1. We did not declare an emergency nor request special handling and treated the situation as a non-emergency maintenance issue requiring RTB (Return To Base).On the initial flight, prior to push, we got an ELEC light, indicating a problem with the standby system. We were also told this was the aircraft's first flight of the day, so it might have come from the maintenance hangar. We called Maintenance and they quickly reset the system and no errors showed. The book was signed off and we departed, only to get the battery discharge after departure.				B737-800 Captain reported an ELEC light illuminated in flight and elected to make an air turn back to departure airport.

We did not stop at 11,000 ft. and were notified by ATC at 11,500 ft. ATC immediately issued a higher cleared altitude.Moments earlier we had a substantial wake turbulence encounter from the preceding 737. This was a large distraction. In addition, this was the last leg of a 3 leg day of a 3 day trip. In hindsight, use of the autopilot would have prevented this entirely. Next time on a departure with hold downs I will use the autopilot.				B737-900 First Officer reported encountering wake turbulence from a preceding B737 departing LAS. This distraction contributed to missing a crossing restriction.

The gear indications were still 3 green and 3 red lights. We kept the air speed at 225 kts. and ran the QRH for Landing Disagree. We followed the check list and when the gear handle was placed down the gear lights indicated 3 green lights. The controls were transferred to pilot monitoring. Priority handling was requested and we returned to ZZZ and completed a normal landing.				B737-900 Captain reported landing gear indicated unsafe after takeoff and gear retraction attempt. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and manually extend the landing gear to make a precautionary landing.

We verified what indication we had and I called for the QRH Checklist. After we completed that, I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them and Maintenance know our issue. As we continued we did notice a decrease in the A System quantity, but the pressure remained steady. Around 40 minutes later, the B System Engine Driven pump Low Pressure light also illuminated. I called for and we ran the same checklist for the Low Pressure light. We continued to have normal system pressure on the hydraulic pressure gauges so we decided to continue the flight. I instructed the First Officer to send another ACARS message to Dispatch, which he did.At this point, we ran through some possible scenarios and began to prepare for an A System failure. We input data for a normal and A System failure landing into the Weight and Balance. Then we discussed what might happen, once we started to put a higher load on the hydraulic system, such as lowering the gear and flaps, using thrust reverse and nose wheel steering. It became apparent to us that while we were operating normally, our situation could change rapidly. It was at this point we decided to advise ATC and proceed directly to ZZZ. We notified ATC of our hydraulic malfunction and our intention to go directly to our destination. I then asked the First Officer to notify Dispatch of our request for priority handling. He did via ACARS. I contacted the Flight Attendants and briefed them on what we planned to be a normal landing, but that we had requested priority handling and to expect to see the CFR vehicles near the runway.I also briefed the Passengers about the same situation. ATC cleared us direct to the airport and we started our descent. During the Approach Briefing, we had discussed configuring early to allow time for the electric pump gear and flap extension. Those worked as expected and we maintained normal pressure on the hydraulic gauges. The landing was normal. Thrust reverse and spoiler extension operated normally with the slightest of flicker from the Electric Pump Low Pressure lights as mentioned in the QRH. I even had normal nose wheel steering. We cleared the runway and I asked that CFR inspect the aircraft for any visible leaks. They saw none, so we continued to the gate in ZZZ. Upon arrival at the gate, I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. I then wrote up the Two Low Pressure light indications in the logbook.				B737-700 Captain reported hydraulic pump problems in cruise and elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

After raising the gear, he pointed out the engine issue, and we elected to continue the climb while monitoring the engine for further indications of the issue. The engine continued to surge during the climb, with both the N1, EGT, and engine noise seeming to correspond with the surging engine. Upon reaching thrust-reduction altitude, we reduced the power to the CLIMB setting, which seemed to have minimal effect on the surge. The Captain coordinated with ATC that we wanted to continue the climb to our assigned altitude, but might need to return to ZZZ to land due to an engine issue. We continued our climb to 5,000 MSL, and as the engine power reduced to maintain 230 kts., the surging seemed to subside. We concluded that the surging seemed to coincide with higher power settings, and continuing the climb to cruising altitude and on to ZZZ1 didn't seem prudent. The Captain coordinated with ATC for the return to ZZZ, informed the passengers of the issue and that we would be returning to base, and we set up for the RNAV to XXC. The approach and landing were uneventful.Unsure of the causal factors of why the engine would surge, but it seemed to be related to the higher power settings.		After rotation, I noticed the 1 engine EPR fluctuating. I pointed it out to the FO (First Officer). It wasn't fluctuating bad at first but as the aircraft climbed the surging got worse. By the time we reached Acceleration altitude The EPR gauge was fluctuating between 1.35 and 1.5 EPR. The fuel flow, EGT and N1/N2 were fluctuating also. The FO reduced power to CLB power and the surging slowed but continued. I notified Departure that we might have to return to the airport but I wanted to continue straight out to get some altitude. I also wanted to see how the engine behaved after we leveled off and reduce power. Thinking we might have to shut it down if it got worse at a lower power setting. Reaching 5,000 ft. and reducing the power the surging stopped. It was at that time that we told Departure Control that we were ready to return to ZZZ. The remainder of the flight was normal. We landed Runway XXC.		Flight Crew reported engine EPR surging on #1 engine after take off. The Flight Crew elected to perform an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

They had replaced the #1 engine driven hydraulic pump and supply line. The preceding crew also wrote up the #2 B system engine driven hydraulic low pressure light illumination, which Maintenance Operations checked and could not duplicate. Start up through take off were normal. When the Captain raised the gear after takeoff, he noticed a Master Caution FLT CONT light flicker on, then immediately off. At a safer altitude, we both looked around more and found no abnormal indications, so we continued the departure to ZZZ2. In cruise at FL 400, the #1 engine driven hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. The QRH led us to turn off that pump. Both hydraulic systems showed normal pressure and quantity at that point, so we continued to ZZZ2.During the descent with throttles at idle, the #1 oil filter bypass light illuminated. This time the QRH directed a #1 engine shutdown. We transferred aircraft control to the Captain, [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Approach, requested and received extra vectors for time from Approach, completed the QRH Checklist for engine shutdown and single engine landing, and landed flaps 15. Landing and taxi to the gate were otherwise normal. By the time we set the parking brake at the gate, #1 hydraulic quantity, as I recall, showed 37% RF (Re Fill). On post flight walk around, a hydraulic fluid leak from the #1 engine was obvious, and the ground crew had placed a catch box with litter under the leak. Both oil quantities read 100% at post flight.		On retracting gear after takeoff, noticed flight control Master Caution flicker. At cruise, the #1 engine hydraulic light illuminated. I turned off engine pump in accordance with QRH. Pressure and quantity were normal. On descent, oil filter bypass light illuminated. I [requested priority handling] and asked for extended vectors to run checklists. Result was engine shut down at 6000 ft. I informed cabin crew of a maintenance problem and would probably see fire trucks on landing. Landed with flaps 15 uneventfully. At gate noticed A system hydraulic quantity about 18%.		Flight crew reported multiple systems failures after take off and climb. The crew performed an in flight shut down of the affected engine and continued to the destination airport.

I would do the same things based on the indications we had on takeoff.		On the roll for takeoff, we had both Master Caution lights and all lights on the recall or 6 pack panel on both the Captain and First Officer side. We rejected the takeoff because we felt it was the safest thing to do. In my years flying helicopters, and fixed wing I have never seen every light on a panel light up all at once during takeoff. It's hard to say at this time because I did not know what caused it to happen.		Flight crew reported a rejected take off after both master caution lights and both six pack lights illuminated.

I saw the left engine indications winding down. Requested priority handling and requested return to ZZZ. Moments after initial indications, fire warning activated, so ran we the engine fire checklist. After pulling fire handle fire indications stopped so we didn't fire the extinguisher bottle. Rest of the event went just like training in the sim, followed the checklists and landed safely on the long Runway XX. Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting inspected and followed us to the Gate. Single engine time was approximately 20 minutes.				Captain reported engine failure and engine fire warning on climb out.

We arrived at the aircraft at XA:40 to a dark flight deck with only the ground service bus powered. This was the fourth flight of a three-day trip for the Captain-in-training during his first OE sequence. This was also the Captain-in-training qualification flight to/from ZZZZ. The Captain-in-training was the Pilot Flying (PF). ZZZZ had a 1000 ft. ceiling that was clear above 2000 ft. AGL. After a normal takeoff, the right seat Pilot Monitoring (PM) instructor noticed the gear was not retracting and informed the PF the gear were not coming up. Since we were climbing at the 0/Ret Minimum Maneuver speed until we were clear of terrain, we were climbing at 215 kts. We asked to level at 9,000 ft. and hold over the airfield at the ZZZZ1 VOR. It was suspected the nose gear pin had been left in and was possibly missed during the salute. I had considered running the 'Landing Gear Lever Will Not Move Up After Takeoff' QRH. However, the conditions were not met because the gear handle did move up. An attempt was unsuccessfully made to retract the gear by recycling the gear handle. The aircraft was below maximum landing weight and we had a safe landing configuration, so the decision was made to return to ZZZZ to have the suspected bypass pin removed if that was the problem. Upon returning to the gate, it was discovered the pin was not left in the nose gear and Maintenance found no faults in the gear operating system. Upon returning to the flight deck, the Instructor Pilot discovered the manual gear extension access door was ajar. The light on the aft pedestal was not illuminated during preflight and we were not aware of when that door was breached. Upon resetting the access door on the flight deck floor, the light on the aft pedestal extinguished and it was clear we had resolved the problem. An INFO-ITEM was entered into the Approved Model List and the aircraft departed and flew to ZZZ uneventfully with a 60 minute delay.OE training, hit city special qualification airfield training, terrain, weather, ATC foreign communication.Ensure the manual extension access door is firmly closed during every preflight and before takeoff.				Captain reported landing gear would not retract after take off. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

After checking for and noting full quantity and pressure in System A, we ran the QRH Checklist which consisted of turning the pump off. A little over a half hour later, we noticed decreasing hydraulic quantity in System A; it went as low as 11% (but pressure stayed constant at approximately 3,000 PSI throughout the flight). Shortly thereafter, on the initial descent into ZZZ1, we got a LOW PRESSURE caution for the ENG 2 Hydraulic Pump on System B. We again ran the same QRH procedure and switched off that hydraulic pump. Even though the electric pumps were maintaining full hydraulic pressure, we were concerned that we had a limited amount of time before significant functional degradation of our hydraulic systems began, particularly with the fluid loss on System A. Knowing at that point that we were due to receive the standard long, low-altitude vectors into ZZZ1, we requested priority handling and received priority handling for a long, straight-in approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ1. We configured early and everything went normally concluding in a 40-degree flap landing. After landing we carefully checked that hydraulic pressure was still normal on both sides (it was) and had the responding Fire Crews check for visible external fluid leaks. The responding crews did not notice any leaks/fluid and System A Hydraulic Quantity had stabilized at 20%, so we taxied into the gate.				B737-700 First Officer reported problems with the engine driven hydraulic pumps resulting in requesting priority handling and a precautionary landing at destination airport.

We were configured and stabilized at the 1000 ft. call. As the aircraft was in the final arcing left turn, just prior to the 500 ft. callout to the runway, we received a caution obstacle call out. Simultaneously, the ZZZ Tower called us with a Low Altitude Alert, which we acknowledged, and the First Officer disconnected the autopilot and auto-throttles and performed a smooth maneuver to stop the descent and start a climb. The First Officer and I were both sensing that the approach started to look low to us, in reference to the runway, and the runway VASI information showing us a little low. The maneuvering would not have caused the Passengers any concern.The approach remained stabilized and we agreed to continue to the runway and land, since we had the runway and VASI information. The landing was on speed and in the Touchdown Zone. Taxi to the gate was uneventful. After discussing the approach with the First Officer numerous times, (that night and the next day) to go over what might have happened, or if we missed something, we could not conclude that we knew the exact cause. However, from our reviews, we both saw that the Flight Director was 'centered' throughout the approach. We both cannot be 100 [percent] certain that when this event occurred, that the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator) was in VNAV Path or another mode that could have caused the aircraft to drift too low. When I got to the hotel that night, I called the [Company] Chief Pilot and explained what had happened, and to verify that the FDAP (Flight Data Analysis Program) data would be captured that would help in this event.		On arrival to ZZZ, we were cleared for the Park Visual Runway XX at night with the First Officer flying the approach. We were configured and stable at the 1000 ft. call. Around the base turn with autopilot and auto-throttle coupled, after (base turn) but prior to the 500 ft. callout, we both noticed that we looked low visually. The next events happened in rapid succession, so I'm unsure of the order, but I believe the ZZZ Tower called us with a Low Altitude Alert, which we acknowledged. I, [the] Pilot Flying, disconnected the autopilot and auto-throttles and performed a smooth maneuver to stop the descent and start a climb. During that maneuver, we received a Caution Obstacle Alert from the GPWS. The maneuvering would not have caused the Passengers any concern. The approach remained stabilized so we agreed to continue to land since we had the runway and VASI information. The landing was on speed and in the touchdown zone, and the taxi to the gate was uneventful.		B737-700 flight crew reported they received a Ground Proximity Warning and Low Altitude Alert from the Tower while conducting a Charted Visual Approach.

Weather in ZZZ was reporting 700 broken and winds were out of [the] southeast at around 8 kts. Our landing weight was approximately 152.5 and we were on the ILS [Runway] XXR with flaps 30 selected. We had pulled the weather prior to [the] start of our descent briefing and with the rain at the airport we pulled wet landing data from the ACARS system. Our REF speed was approximately 147 kts. and with the winds light there was no additive. We selected AutoBrake3 with the heavy weight and wet runway conditions and an exit at, or after [Taxiway] XX was briefed. At approximately 600ft. the runway was in sight. I declared landing and disconnected the AP/AT for landing. The aircraft felt very heavy and the controls seemed sluggish in response to input. I recall having added N1 to approximately 65 which I felt unusual at the time. As landing was being made and during the flare the stall warning went off and the aircraft seemed to fall the last 10 feet resulting in an abrupt, but not hard, landing. The aircraft did not encounter a tail strike and a normal rollout and exit at [Taxiway] XX was accomplished. Upon taxi in FO and I discussed why the horn had gone off. REF speed was a few knots above the 5 kt. add and with the wind being reported as southwesterly we ruled out a possible wind shift to a tailwind. The only conclusion I could draw out if this was that the aircraft stalled, if that's what actually happened, due to inaccurate cargo/passenger weights and the subsequent lower airspeeds resulted in a potentially dangerous situation. Pull FOQA data on the aircraft and see what actually happened compared to what I interpret happened. I also need to remember that an aircraft can stall at any time and in any configuration even if you are doing everything right. Go-around when that voice inside my head says something isn't right.				B737 NG Captain reported control input responses were sluggish then they received a stall warning while over the runway resulting in an abrupt landing.

We were both smelling a 'plastic' smell similar to what you smell when opening a box with new electronics inside. It was a clean plastic smell rather than a burning plastic smell. Because it was so different and quite faint, we both felt this was not a fume event. Upon parking at the gate, I asked the rest of the crew if they experienced anything. There was no odor in the main cabin at all. I asked them how they were feeling and they said they were fine. Because my FO and I felt fine and the event was so different, we truly were uncertain as to whether or not there was even a problem. I exited the airplane to chat with the outbound CA (Captain). She and I spent a few minutes discussing the situation. In the interest of safety, the decision was made to enter the event into the logbook.				A320 Captain reported a fume event during descent which was isolated to the flight deck of undetermined source.

We got the aircraft under control and noticed the First Officers altimeter fluctuating wildly. We transferred controls to my side and notified ATC of the altitude deviation and started working the problem. We referenced the Quick Reference Handbook for FMC scratch pad messages IRS-R Drift and Verify POS: IRS-IRS. While working on those issues with the autopilot on the A side, all of the First Officer's PFD instruments displayed all flags with an IRS FAULT. We ran the Quick Reference Handbook for IRS FAULT, but could not fix it and continued flight to ZZZ2 with no autopilot/auto throttle. Being busy hand-flying and trying to manage the navigation problem we unintentionally neglected to notify Dispatch of our problem. We had already coordinated our arrival with ZZZ2 Operations and asked to have Maintenance meet the aircraft. Maintenance met us at the gate and I wrote up the IRS FAULT in the logbook. We then handed the aircraft over to Maintenance in ZZZ2.		While cruising, en route from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 near ZZZ3 at FL 340 with the autopilot engaged, the aircraft started a rapid un commanded climb to FL 350. I disconnected the autopilot and got the aircraft stabilized and transferred aircraft control to the Captain as my altimeter and airspeed were fluctuating wildly. We notified ATC of the deviation, re-stabilized at FL 340 and went to the Quick Reference Handbook to troubleshoot the problem. We had FMC messages of IRS-R Drift and Verify POS: IRS-IRS. While working this issue, the First Officer's instruments displayed all flags with an IRS FAULT annunciation. We ran the Quick Reference Handbook for IRS FAULT, but were unable to restore the First Officer's instruments. We notified ATC we were unable RVSM, got a lower altitude and the Captain hand-flew the aircraft to ZZZ2. We notified Ops and Maintenance at ZZZ2 but were very busy and neglected to notify Dispatch. Maintenance met us at the gate and I wrote up the IRS FAULT in the logbook. We then handed the aircraft over to Maintenance at ZZZ2.		B737-700 Flight Crew reported the aircraft began an uncommanded climb at cruise. The Flight Crew determined that the L IRS system had failed and switched over to the R IRS system.

Conditions for our departure were IFR with light precipitation. We departed XXL with a tailwind, Takeoff Go Around, APU ON, ANTI-ICE ON, CONFIG 2, and immediately found ourselves in widespread light to moderate precipitation, light to moderate chop, and a need to begin deviations for weather as we proceeded on course. We cleaned the aircraft up, including turning off the APU bleed and APU as normal. While climbing through 10000 ft., I noticed an unusual odor that was gradually increasing in strength. I asked my Captain if he detected it also, and he said yes. Before reaching FL180, the #1 Flight Attendant called the cockpit and stated that he smelled an unusual 'oily, burnt hydraulic fluid' smell. I concurred and thought that was an apt description. My Captain asked him to try to determine if it seemed to be getting stronger, dissipating, or staying the same, and if it were possible to see where it may be coming from. After reaching FL250, or just a few minutes later, several of the Flight Attendants called back at the same time and informed my Captain that they found the smell to be at least as strong, if not more so than previously reported. I explained to him that I had a good understanding and awareness of Smoke/Odor/Fumes events, and it was my opinion that we were experiencing one. He then asked me for my input about how we should proceed. I said that I felt it would be wise to [put on] our oxygen masks, land without delay at the nearest suitable airport and run the Smoke/Odor/Fumes and Overweight Landing checklists on the way to that airport. He agreed and informed the Cabin Crew of our intentions while I took the radios in addition to flying duties and [requested priority handling] an immediate return to ZZZ. While making our return to ZZZ, the widespread precipitation conditions we were in were such that our weather radar displayed mostly green returns, with occasional yellow interspersed within which would normally indicate light rain, but the very loud rain noise made it obvious that we were in at least very heavy precipitation. This phenomenon was making the radar of not very much use other than to confirm that there was rain in front of us. Constant light to moderate chop persisted through the entire event, also. Another trait of the Airbus 320 family is that the VHF radios produce a great deal of loud static when flying through precipitation for extended periods, and particularly in the vicinity of charged clouds, which in this case made ATC difficult if not impossible to understand at times, and added to the now very loud environment of the cockpit. Despite these challenges, we were able to comply with ATC's directions and make a nearly direct path back to the ILS for Runway XXL (which by now was no longer experiencing a tailwind for landing). My Captain recognized that we would be back on the ground soon enough that he had to prioritize which QRH checklist to execute, the Smoke/Odor/Fumes checklist, or the Overweight Landing Checklist. We chose to perform the Overweight Landing checklist first and found that when we turned the APU and APU BLEED on as the procedure directs, the odor began to abate. We were satisfied that this configuration of the air conditioning system was now the optimal one and decided to continue to land without further reference to the Smoke/Odor/Fumes checklist, as time before landing was now quite short. I made a relatively soft landing, approximately 12000 lbs. overweight without any other irregularities, and we taxied the aircraft to the gate normally. There were no excessive brake temperatures. By this time, we could scarcely detect the odor anymore, and I felt comfortable to have my oxygen mask off for the duration of the taxi. It may be that we had begun to acclimate to the smell, because when we parked at the gate and opened the main cabin door, the Mechanics who immediately boarded the airplane stated that they noticed the telltale smell right away. Appropriate Maintenance logbook entries were made, a Smoke/Odor/Fumes form was completed, and much discussion with the Mechanics took place about what we experienced.As of yet, I haven't heard any confirmation of what caused the event in this airplane. I could only speculate that oil or hydraulic fluid found its way into the bleed system of one or both engines and was transmitted as a fine vapor through the packs and into the cabin. It seems that the APU may not be a likely culprit in this case as the smell wasn't noticed by us during taxi-out, take-off, or during our overweight landing. The APU BLEED was supplying air to the packs in all three of these instances.I think that this is an area where it would be best to solicit suggestions from Maintenance Personnel and the manufacturer. I have what I would judge as a heightened awareness of these events (especially now), but not a complete understanding of the specific Mechanics of these events as it pertains to the engine/APU bearings, oil systems, etc. The industry, company, and pilot unions seems to have taken significant steps in recent years to address these events and raise awareness, but my suggestion would be to pursue these steps further. I have flown with many pilots who have limited knowledge of the prevalence and risks associated with Smoke/Odor/Fume events, which is surprising considering that (based on my limited perspective and data) these events seem to rank high among drivers of QRH usage and diversions, etc. I think including information about them in distance learning modules would be a good idea.				Air Carrier First Officer reported a fume event during climb. After being notified by flight attendants that the odor was also detected in the cabin the flight crew requested priority handling to departure airport where support personnel met the flight.

Selected PACK 1 - OFF again and accomplished Guidance step 14. Logbook entry made, Fumes Report completed and discussion with Maintenance Control personnel.				Air Carrier Captain reported a chemical odor in the cockpit during descent. The flight crew completed the appropriate Flight Crew Operations Manual procedure which caused the odor to dissipate. The flight continued to destination.

While keeping the safety of flight as the primary intent, it became evident that the diversion to RKSI was in the best overall interest considering: the amount of time the aircraft would need to be grounded for a maintenance inspection, crew duty limitations, fuel and weather factors, and our customer's needs. The Chinese ATC was very helpful and accommodating with our diversion request.While operating as the relief crew in cruise flight at FL351 (10,700 meters) over China we encountered moderate to severe clear air turbulence. Airspeed rapidly increased through the Maximum Speed indication to at least 340 kts. indicated, and the overspeed warning sounded. Crew coordination and control inputs were applied to stabilize the encounter. The airspeed remained above the Maximum Speed indication for a number of seconds before dropping down. The airspeed then dropped rapidly past the airspeed bug and the stick shaker was activated for a brief second requiring continued control inputs by the PF (Pilot Flying) to stabilize the situation. Once we cleared the turbulence (or what appeared to be a strong rogue wave of air) and stabilized the airspeed, we reported the encounter to ATC. Another aircraft approximately 5 minutes ahead of us at 11,300 meters reported a windshear encounter to ATC just before our report. We performed the Overspeed non-normal checklist. We then woke up the PIC (Pilot in Command) and FO (First Officer) of the flight who were in rest and briefed them of what had occurred. We then contacted Company Dispatch and informed them of the occurrence. The operational decision was made to divert to RKSI due to the reasons mentioned above. We concurred with the decision and diverted to RKSI. The remainder of the flight was uneventful. After we blocked in we made an appropriate entry into the aircraft log for an inspection.1. Be more cognitive of and place more emphasis on areas of forecasted turbulence while route planning our flights. 2. Better turbulence forecasting technology.		In cruise flight at approximately XA00z north of OMBON waypoint in CHINA the relief crew encountered moderate clear air turbulence which rapidly increased in intensity to severe causing a violent increase in airspeed above MMO activating a red master warning overspeed message. The PF (Pilot Flying) ( relief CA (Captain)) immediately responded with decrease of thrust and use of speed brakes to reduce speed to normal regime however the clear air turbulence was severe enough to increase speed roughly 40 - 50 kts. above MMO after a few seconds the speed was reduced below MMO however the wind shear was strong enough to decrease speed to the min speed regime and a momentary stick shaker activation was felt for a brief second as the airspeed was restore to normal. During this event the PM (Pilot Monitoring) (relief FO (First Officer)) supported the PF monitoring flight condition, communicating to ATC to coordinate a change of altitude and reported large speed fluctuations and requested pilot reports if available. ATC assigned a lower altitude from 35,100 ft. to 33,100 ft. converted in meters. Several minutes later another aircraft reported wind-shear conditions with violent airspeed fluctuations in the same region roughly 2,000 ft. above our altitude. After recovery to normal flight condition the crew followed with checklists and company manuals to assure flight was safe to continue, since it was determined that a maintenance write-up had to be done the relief crew immediately informed the PIC (Pilot in Command) and FO of the situation to consult Dispatch, Maintenance and on-call duty pilot. Maintenance and Crew duty limitations being an issue, operations therefore decided that it was in the companies best interest to divert the flight to RKSI instead of continuing to our original destination of ZZZ1. At which time ATC was informed by the PM (Pilot Monitoring) to change destination to RKSI. While dispatch worked in the re-routing of flight ATC provided vectors in direction to our new destination. Flight was re-released and completed uneventfully to RKSI where a maintenance crew promptly received the aircraft. North of OMBON waypoint in CHINA the was a pocket of severe clear air turbulence with violent horizontal wind-shear producing large speed fluctuations. These conditions were experienced by other aircraft in the region from 35,100 ft. to 37,100 ft. I feel our crew did an amazing CRM job, everybody put their best attitude and effort with safety in mind and prioritized to keep the aircraft safe as well as to cooperate to the fullest with the company. However this scenario makes me aware and wanting to emphasize overspeed recovery techniques. Clear air turbulence is as hazardous as any other weather phenomena and awareness of its significance is a very valuable lesson that the pilot group can benefit from.		B777 flight crew reported an over speed situation, due to severe turbulence encounter, resulted in destination diversion.

At 'Flaps' it was observed that the flap handle was at 30 but the flap position indicator displayed flaps 1.We elected to increase airspeed to the white caret on the airspeed indicator and proceed with the landing. We did not set the Ground Proximity Flap Inhibit switch to 'Flap Inhibit' which resulted in receiving the 'Too Low - Terrain' aural warning. The aircraft was on profile so we ignored the warning and landed normally, with a slightly longer than normal rollout.After touchdown the 'PSEU' (Proximity Switch Electronic Unit) light illuminated and the flaps moved to 30. We were able to raise the flaps after clearing the runway; subsequently the 'PSEU' light extinguished.Cause - We elected to land in lieu of going around in an aircraft with unknown possible flight control issues. Aircraft was on profile on a clear night with light winds and a long runway. The alternative was to take the aircraft back into the air to perform the QRH procedure and attempt an alternate flap extension procedure.Suggestions - This would be a useful training scenario.				B737-800 pilot reported a flap indication issue during final approach, resulting in a terrain warning. The aircraft was reportedly on profile, so the crew elected to continue the landing.

Upon arrival I missed the fuel leak from the #2 Engine. This was pointed out from ramp and required Maintenance to come out. These issues lead to us missing that the aircraft terminated with 58% oil on #1 Engine and had not been serviced. After pushback and engine start, Mechanic signaled that the leak from #2 was within limits and we were cleared to operate as normal. On departure out of ZZZ, due to light aircraft weight, there was a high angle of attack on departure. While switching to Departure frequency, I noticed the engine indications beginning to flash, which showed our #1 engine oil quantity dropping to approximately 2%. With crew coordination we continued to fly the departure while monitoring all other engine indications, which remained normal. As I flew, the Captain opened the QRH and we agreed to lower the angle of attack and reduce power while troubleshooting. This caused the oil quantity to increase and the flashing engine indications to cease. We agreed that with normal indications we were okay to continue and maintained a lower angle of attack on climb out. The Captain sent a message to Dispatch, requesting oil service in ZZZ1 and we landed with no further abnormal indications.Be more vigilant during perceived compressed timelines situations. All Crews aware of terminating oil quantity levels to prevent downline issues.		Due to distractions caused by a #2 Engine fuel leak. I did not completely review the logbook which resulted in departing with a low oil quantity. During preflight, as I was reviewing the logbook, I was notified by the Ramp that there was a fuel leak under the #2 Engine. I went downstairs to investigate the situation and discovered a very large puddle of fuel under the nacelle and fuel dripping from the bottom of the engine. I returned to the flight deck and asked the F/O (First Officer) to call for Maintenance. I then called Dispatch and alerted them to the situation and the made a PA to let the passengers know that we were working an issue and might push a bit late. The mechanic showed up and we discussed the situation and agreed that it was acceptable. He then looked through the logbook and confirmed there had been a previous write up for the same issue. He felt it was safe to continue and said he would watch the engine during push back and engine start to make certain the leak stopped. We completed our checklist, except I did not go back and review the terminating oil, which is the point where the distraction occurred. Everything after push back and taxi out were normal. On takeoff, due to the light load and high deck angle, we received a low oil quantity indication. We lowered the pitch angle and the oil quantity indication rose back to 45%. We continued the climb to FL 270 at 2,000 FPM and received normal indications for the remainder of the flight. Once at cruise, I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch, requesting oil service upon arrival in ZZZ1. I also reviewed the logbook and found that the last three terminating oil entries reflected the need for service. The aircraft flew at least 3 legs requiring oil service per limitation AOM 3.8.4. The terminating oil level in ZZZ2 was recorded at 65%. The aircraft then flew to ZZZ1 and ZZZ and terminated with 58%. Oil servicing should have been completed at least in ZZZ.Crews, to include myself, need to pay closer attention to the terminating oil levels posted in the logbook and call for servicing as required. Additionally, any aircraft that terminates at a station with maintenance, should be checked and topped off. This would prevent this from ever occurring again, at least from a Maintenance facility.		Air carrier flight crew reported #1 engine oil had not been serviced prior to departure and was low. During climb, the #1 engine oil quantity indication decreased due to high angle of attack. The flight Crew reduced the angle, the oil quantity returned to normal, and the flight was continued to destination airport.

I arrived at the airport on the shuttle at approximately XA:20am local time. I proceeded immediately to the gate and found the FO (First Officer) already on board. We exchanged greetings and confirmed what we had said the previous day that the FO would act as Pilot Flying, PF to ZZZ and I would act as PF returning to ZZZ1. The FO then briefed me that they had completed the power up and receiving check lists. I then took the release and briefed inflight crew. Next, I entered the cockpit to retrieve a safety vest in order to perform the preflight inspection walk around. During the walk around, I found a greenish, somewhat foamy and oily appearing liquid dripping from the APU bay from the space between the two doors of the APU compartment. I further inspected to determine the fluid I noticed could not be from lavatory waste, water or drain masts. It was not from any of the other possibilities and the unknown fluid had formed a puddle of approximate dimensions of a circle of 2-3 ft. in diameter. I then completed the walk around inspection, looked for a member of Maintenance team outside and found no one, then re-entered the aircraft cockpit. I requested the FO call operations and request a Maintenance member to come to the aircraft. The FO said OK and good as we also had a fault that needed Maintenance to clear. In just a short time, Maintenance Lead, came to the cockpit and I told him of both issues. He performed a reset of the fault and said he would go outside to visually inspect the fluid leak. Maintenance Lead returned and told us that the leaking fluid was only type 4 de ice fluid. I questioned that since we do not deice in ZZZ1 if he was certain. Maintenance Lead said that it was not unusual for deice fluid to take a long time to exit the aircraft, but he was certain. I had not made entry in the logbook as no corrective action was required. We finished our duties and departed ZZZ1 for ZZZ. The flight was uneventful, and we landed and taxied to the gate. The preflight walk around for Aircraft X was completed by the FO who stated as soon as they returned that there did not appear to be anything leaking from the APU area. I thanked her and we continued to perform all preflight duties according to SOP. Part of these duties include checking Hydraulic fluid quantities are in the acceptable range, they were. The flight blocked out at XI51 UTC and all duties and responsibilities were performed in accordance with all regulation and SOP. Takeoff and climb were uneventful and the aircraft was cleared to ZZZZZ intersection and to climb unrestricted to flight level 340.At approximately XJ32 UTC, we were presented with a level 2 caution message HYD G RSVR LO LVL. I first stated, 'I am pilot flying.' Then directed for the FO to check there was no QRC including bypass item. She did and stated nothing was found. At that point I told the FO that I have had this very same hydraulic issue in a 'Classic' A320 previously. I added that I could see no reason at this point to [request priority handling] as we did not need priority handling as yet. I further stated at this time that our intent was to continue to destination. The FO said she understood, and I then turned the flying over to her with the statement, 'you have control'. She responded with 'I have control ECAM actions'. I performed the ECAM and reviewed the QRH for the fault. We then discussed how we wanted to make notifications to Inflight, ATC and the company. After good discussions between the FO and myself, we made the decision to tell Inflight via briefing the number one flight attendant face-to-face and they could then tell their crew. Secondly, we would inform the company via ACARS as they needed time to arrange a ground crew to move the aircraft from the runway. We decided that we would let ZZZ1 Approach ATC know when we were directed to speak to them and at that time, we would [request priority handling]. We brought the number one flight attendant into the cockpit to brief them, we also told the number one flight attendant that this would be a [priority landing], and they asked several great questions regarding the loss of the Green hydraulic system. When all their questions were answered, the flight crew took a restroom break and the number one flight attendant returned to the cabin. I then sent an ACARS message to Operations Control that told them of the problem and our intent to land in ZZZ1. Very soon after I answered a SATCOM call from Operations Control to review the message and see if we wanted assistance from Maintenance Control. I stated they should let us know if there was anything of importance to add, but I have personally been through this same fault previously and I was not concerned. I did discuss at great length with the FO that when I had personally been through this previously, that the hydraulic fluid had drained from a broken fitting in the number one pylon into the number one engine creating a great deal of smoke. I emphasized that my experience was to remain open throughout the conduct of the non-normal situation to expect something unplanned to occur and that we would handle whatever else came up with the same professional adherence to SOP we had with the fault we were given. I went on to tell the FO that I wanted every bit of information they might have to add to the successful outcome, and nothing was to be left unsaid. I told the FO 'I want to hear the craziest thing you have ever said, which is to say, I do not want you to hesitate to say anything and I value anything you have to say'. We were cleared to descend using the ZZZZZ1 XX RNAV ARRIVAL to ZZZ1 and plan landing south. The arrival and approaches were briefed. On first contact with ZZZ1 Approach the FO also then [requested priority handling]. There was brief discussion on the nature of the emergency and what services we required. The FO passed along that we would require a slightly longer than normal downwind leg to facilitate deploying the gear via emergency procedures and that we would request CFR meet the aircraft after we stopped for a visual inspection, as we had previously discussed. ATC confirmed that this was acceptable, and we performed the longer downwind. The FO deployed the landing gear via the alternate procedure, and we requested to turn in for the visual landing. At approximately 1,000 ft. from landing, the flight attendants called to say that passengers were concerned with a smell of burning hydraulic fluid. I knew there was no time to do anything with that, so I performed the landing as we had briefed to a full stop and CFR conducted a visual and infrared inspection to declare all clear. We then started the APU and when the start was complete, shut down both engines using the SOP for after landing and parking. We did have to customize both checklists as some items could not be completed until we were at the gate and even then, the emergency gear extension handle was required to remain out and not stowed.The aircraft was towed by [Ramp] Personnel to Gate XX in ZZZ1 and the passengers were deplaned. The FO called to confirm our gate assignment and operations asked if we had [requested priority handling with] inflight. I asked the FO to not answer that request as we were still not complete with the flight. All possible checklists and procedures were complied with prior to leaving the aircraft once we were at the gate. The parking checklist was completed except for the emergency gear handle and deplaning was begun. Then someone from Operations knocked on the door and asked to speak to me to ask if I declared a situation to inflight. I asked if we could speak later. I spoke to all Inflight crew to thank them for their professionalism and dedication to customer safety. I reiterated the same to the two members of Inflight management who were now on board. I then called for Maintenance to come to the aircraft for a debriefing. The reply to this request wasto ask if I had declared a situation to inflight, as I knew that this was an open frequency and that it was available for anyone to be listening, I did not answer. I asked again for Tech Ops to meet me at the aircraft. At this time the FO was ready to depart, and I took a moment to sincerely thank them for being such a great professional and told them how I genuinely appreciated them for making my job so much easier. We shook hands and briefly embraced and said goodbye.NAME1 from Maintenance was on board, and I briefed him on everything and asked him if he needed more than my short logbook entry that we experienced HYD G RSVR LO LVL in flight. He replied no and I handed over the aircraft to him. When I arrived in the gate area, the gate agents said I was supposed to wait and speak to Operations on the phone. The Gate Agent dialed the phone and the Operations person asked me if I had declared a situation to inflight. I replied that I was unsure of answering any questions at that time and would be filing all required reports. I then departed the airport and went home.Thoughts: I would like to know where the hydraulic leak occurred.Crew members need to not give out operational information, or ask questions regarding operational issues of emergency or non-normal situations over open radio frequencies.		I was the First Officer operating Aircraft X. I arrived at XA00 local time and began the power up and receiving checklist. The Captain arrived shortly thereafter, checked the logbook, and performed the walk around. He then reported seeing fluid under the APU. We called Maintenance for that issue as well as a reset on the ECAM. The Maintenance Technician assured us that the fluid was deicing fluid and he cleaned it up. He performed the reset. The rest of the preflight was normal. I was pilot flying first leg, and the flight to ZZZ was uneventful. I performed the walk around in ZZZ and took extra time to specifically look for any leaks or fluids. There were none. Takeoff and climb out were uneventful.  We were level at FL 340 when we received a HYD G RSVR LO LVL. The Captain was Pilot Flying and called for the QRC. I checked that, including the bypass items. I said 'No QRC'. He then transferred control to me and I said 'I have control, ECAM actions'. We then carefully completed the ECAM, QRH, and discussed our plan of action. Subsequently we spoke with the Lead Flight Attendant, gave her detailed information about what to expect, and told her it was a Code Yellow.  We then sent a message to Operations Control, answered a SELCAL from them, and discussed our plan with them. They were in agreement with continuing our flight to ZZZ1. Once on ZZZ1 Approach we [requested priority handling], gave ATC specific information and requested CFR meet the aircraft to confirm we were safe to be towed to the gate. We followed all checklists to manually deploy the landing gear and stopped on the runway as Nose wheel steering was inoperative. Once at the gate we completed the logbook and debriefed the flight attendants. Once all passengers deplaned, Inflight departed, Maintenance arrived. At this time I asked if the Captain needed me further. He told me I was fine to leave, and I departed.		A320 flight crew reported loss of Green Hydraulic System fluid in flight. The flight crew requested priority handling and performed an alternate landing gear extension, followed by a safe landing.

Three hours into the flight we descended from FL360 to 10,000 ft. for the arrival into ZZZ. After level off we detected a slight odor in the cockpit. As we continued the descent to 6,000 ft. the odor became more intense. All of the inflight confirmed the smell and characterized it as burning alcohol/oil in the aft galley. We realized the aircraft was having another fumes event and expedited the landing. Pack one was turned off after landing since that appeared to work for previous crew who had also had a fumes event in this aircraft. Unfortunately, after exposure to the fumes one becomes numb to the odor and it is difficult to determine if any action corrected the situation. At the Gate the next crew boarded the aircraft and confirmed the fumes were still present.				Air Carrier flight crew reported a fume event during descent which was characterized as burning alcohol/oil in the aft galley. Flight crew continued to troubleshoot the fumes issue as they expedited to a safe landing. After passengers deplaned the new crew verified the fumes were still present.

Immediately after that ATC instructed us to climb to 5,000 to avoid the unknown traffic. I could see the traffic at this point. The automation was slow to climb, so I disconnected the autopilot to help expedite.  ATC then instructed us to turn left to 140 for traffic avoidance. Just as I started the turn--or continued it, really--we got an aural traffic alert followed immediately by an RA. All of this happened very quickly. The RA commanded a descent, which was unexpected. But the FO noticed immediately and verbalized it. I disconnected the auto throttle and pushed the nose down, but overcoming the climb momentum was difficult and took a lot of effort. The traffic passed in front of us and to our right, quite closely, apparently climbing. ATC was advised we were complying with an RA. On the 140 heading at about 3,700 feet we were clear of the conflict and ATC had us maintain 4,000 and turn back to 170. The controller informed us the conflict aircraft had entered Class B without clearance and was being tracked. We continued vectors for a visual to XXR and landed normally with no further incident. I believe the vector to 140 ATC gave us made the difference.Cause - Aircraft entering ZZZ Class B airspace without clearance.At the time we were in Class B airspace and slowing to configure at this point was not necessary, but had I been at a slower speed we would have had more time, although we were converging. Also, I turned the autopilot off and pushed the thrust manually because I sensed we were going to have to maneuver, but we were not technically in an RA. I should have turned the auto throttle off then also, which would have helped some in the reversal from climb to descent, maybe.				B737-800 Captain reported an NMAC during initial approach with another aircraft that had entered Class B airspace without a clearance.

Noxious and toxic fumes filled the entire aircraft cabin and flight-deck during approach and landing/taxi. All occupants onboard were exposed to these fumes for more than 18 minutes. My crew of 6 and I experienced varying degrees of significant symptoms including, sore throat, burning runny eyes, hoarse vocals, light headedness, dizziness, concentration issues and breathing irritation during and immediately following this event. I used supplemental oxygen when I realized that the fumes were getting worse. I remained on O2 through landing. During deplaning I overheard several passengers concerns of exposure to toxic chemicals and fumes during flight.I made a logbook entry clearly stating we had a Heavy Noxious Fumes Event. After a brief post flight inspection of the engines maintenance techs discovered potential mechanical disintegration of an engine resulting in large metal fragments present in the oil. They grounded the aircraft for engine replacement saying 'This plane has major problems!' The maintenance staff smelt the residual toxic fumes on board. I don't think I bought off on previous fumes events entirely. I'm a believer now! This event was dangerous and could have been much worse. We were fortunate to land safely. Even though we just had this significant fumes event, my crew and I were encouraged by the Company to reluctantly fly another scheduled leg that same evening without evaluation by a medical professional. When queried on fumes exposure processes or procedures and med evaluation, company reps told me they didn't think any existed. When I spoke with MedAire at my hotel on my symptoms I was told I should not have flown after the fumes exposure.				Air Carrier Captain reported 'Noxious and Toxic' fumes during approach. The flight continued and executed a safe landing during which the flight crew and passengers experienced physiological symptoms. At the arrival gate the aircraft was removed from service by maintenance

I requested priority handling with a brief description of Electrical Odor in cabin. We were immediately turned back to field. We landed overweight. Upon landing the flight attendants said the odor had dissipated and we taxied under our own power to the Gate.		First Officer (FO) was PF and Captain was PM. During initial climb Captain and FO smelled an odor. Approximately 30-60 seconds afterwards the Flight Attendants called to report an odor in the Cabin that smelled to them like an electrical smoke odor. We immediately declared and emergency and requested to return back to the field. We had to land overweight. All checklists and tasks were accomplished prior to landing. We landed without issue after landing Flight Attendants said they no longer had the odor. We taxied to the Gate without further issue.		Air Carrier flight crew reported a fume event during initial climb. Both cockpit and cabin crew noticed the 'electrical' odor. Flight crew requested priority handling for an immediate air return. The flight executed a safe overweight landing.

During climbout while Captain was flying pilot through approximately 8000 ft with the autopilot off at 250 kts I noticed the Master Caution illuminate. On the overhead panel I saw MACH TRIM FAIL light was illuminated. Captain called 'my aircraft' while I opened the QRH. The procedure only says to fly below 280 Kts/.82. ATC then asked us to accelerate to 300 kts. I told them 280 was as fast as we could do and that we were troubleshooting a flight control malfunction. CA (Captain) then tried to engage the autopilot but CMD A or CMD B would not take. After climbing through 12,000 feet the jump seater advised that the mach trim fail light had extinguished. The Captain was then able to engage the autopilot. After passing approx, 18,000 [ft.] the mach trim fail light returned as we continued the climb with the autopilot on and the autopilot began to capture FL240, the CA noticed the aircraft was potentially going to continue through FL240 and then decided to disconnect the autopilot. He described feeling a lot of forward control pressure for the level off and what he described as an abnormal amount of nose up trim was required. At that point we decided to return to ZZZ1 based on the abnormal trim situation he described to me. CA then gave me the aircraft and radios while he advised the FA's (Flight Attendants), Dispatch, and passenger while also running the non routine landing checklist and overweight landing checklist. ATC asked if we needed any assistance; I relayed the message to the CA and he advised me that we would not need any assistance and I advised ATC. We continued and set up for an overweight landing. On final the Captain took the aircraft back for the landing which had a touchdown that was less than 100ft/min. The 280kts/.82 restriction per the QRH was never exceeded and the autopilot was never re-engaged.I'm unaware of any other factors that may have contributed to this event.		Normal takeoff and climb. At 8000 [ft.] MSL the Master Caution & Mach Trim lights illuminated. The CA (Captain) stated, 'my aircraft' and continued to fly while the FO (First Officer) opened the QRH. It advised not to exceed 280 KIAS or .82 mach. The CA tried both autopilots but neither CMD A or B would engage. We continued climb past 12000 [ft.] MSL and the Jumpseat Pilot told us that the Mach Trim light extinguished. The CMD B continued to not work but the CMD A autopilot engaged. Passing approximately FL180 the Master Caution and Mach Trim lights illuminated again. CA and FO continued climb out while considering options to the destination. Leveling at FL240 the aircraft failed to level off and overshot altitude by 200 [ft]. The CA disconnected the autopilot and immediately felt a large amount of nose down trim, which pitched the nose down and the crew noticed a flash of the Stab Trim light. The CA recovered the momentary nose low condition with yoke aft application and used normal stabilizer trim to continue level flight. The Flight Attendants in the rear galley area experienced a 'light headed feeling' during the recovery. The crew decided to return the aircraft to ZZZ1 without use of the autopilot. We maintained a speed well below 280 KIAS and requested a return with ZZZ Center. The CA had the FO fly the descent to approach while accomplishing the descent, Non-Routine Landing and Overweight Landing checklists. The CA chose to land the aircraft. The aircraft landed overweight, at 152.5K, with a normal touchdown and approximately 100 FPM sink. Taxi back was normal.The aircraft had been recently returned to service after a long storage.		B737-800 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after experiencing flight control issues related to Mach Trim anomalies.

The pressurization page came up and we observed 4,000 FPM. We immediately stopped our climb at 13,000 ft. When the plane leveled off and the power came back the cabin altitude and vertical speed stabilized. We had no ECAMs or warning or cautions. We asked to descend to 12,000 ft. Cabin altitude was operating normally. We asked to climb to 15,000 ft and when the power came up and we began to climb the same happened.We immediately ask for a descent to 10,000 ft. Again the cabin altitude and the rate of climb/descent was normal. We elected to [request priority handling] asked to hold at 10,000 ft. to burn fuel so as not to have an overweight landing. The cabin altitude stayed at 900 ft. during the hold. On descent for the approach the jump seaters noticed the cabin alt go into a slight climb for a few minutes than return to normal. [We had an] uneventful landing. [The problem was] high pressure air and pressurization computers malfunctioning [due to it being an] older aircraft. Some of the aircraft are old. Mechanical malfunctions will occur although in my years with the Airline they are very rare.				A320 Pilot reported cabin pressure control failure on climb and performed an air turn back and landing at departure airport.

The Captain selected LVL CHG and tried to set the speed with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP (Mode Control Panel). He then noted that the airspeed would not change with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP. All three airspeed indicators matched so we knew it was not airspeed unreliable. We tried different vertical modes and turned the autothrottle off and back on and still could not change the speed with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP. We finally decided to [request priority handling] as a precaution and turned off the autopilot and autothrottles and continued the approach. We landed without incident. At touchdown the MCP speed indicated 193 kt. but aircraft speed was at VREF+5. [I suggest to] maintain aircraft.		On arrival into ZZZ for Runway XXR, Approach cleared us to a lower altitude and airspeed off the published arrival. I selected LVL CHG on the MCP (Mode Control Panel) and started the descent [and] then I selected the slower assigned airspeed within the IAS/MACH window on the MCP. As I rotated the knob, the airspeed did not change. I then turned the autothrottle off and back on with the speed still not responding when rotating the knob. Hence, with the autopilot engaged, the aircraft was maintaining the airspeed stuck in [the] window. I then turned off autopilot and autothrottle and manually descended and slowed the aircraft to what Approach has assigned us.It was then [that] Approach turned us onto base and cleared us to a lower altitude and airspeed and switched us to Tower after clearing us for a visual approach to XXR. We then decided to [request priority handling] as a precaution. Tower asked us if we wanted to land on the longer Runway XXL and if we wanted AARF (airport rescue and fire fighting) to respond. I answered in the affirmative to both offers. As we were maneuvering to XXL, we confirmed we had reliable airspeed. During this time the FO (First Officer) dialed in the ILS frequency and I slowed and configured early, captured the LOC and GS, and landed without incident. The vertical and lateral guidance in HUD was accurate but the airspeed cues were not. The airspeed bug and airspeed carrot were based on airspeed stuck in IAS/MACH window on MCP. After landing and clearing the runway, we cancelled the [priority handling]. By the way, FO Name did a fantastic job backing me up, running the appropriate checklists and radios, and making great suggestions.		Air carrier flight crew reported loss of airspeed control on approach. The flight crew disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles systems and continued the approach and landing.

At FL 250 about 12 miles west of the SPINK intersection the aircraft shuddered then rolled left rapidly and the nose yawed. I immediately grasped the yoke and not sure if I turned off the autopilot or if it disengaged, but I rolled the aircraft back to level flight. I was looking outside and saw the roll coming back through 10 degrees, I asked the F/O if he saw how far left we banked. He said he thought 20 degrees. I called back to see if the F/A's were ok. They said three of them were in the aft galley and had been tossed around and the contents of the aft galley bins had been thrown on the floor. Cans, drinks and ice. One F/A was in the aisle and said she had been able to brace against a seat. No one reported any injuries at this time. We asked ATC what we were following and they reported a (other carrier) aircraft. I noted the wind at altitude was 280/20 which was a direct tailwind to our track. As we continued we got occasional buffeting which may have been wake related. As we got in the terminal area, ATC issued a visual and I attempted to remain above the A330's flight path on final. I even slowed more to allow more distance between us. I flew one dot high on the ILS glideslope yet at 800 ft AGL, we encountered another minor roll event. Aircraft remained controllable and we continued normally. On the ground, post flight, I spoke with all four F/A's, again asking if they had any injuries. They said just sore and possible bruising from being tossed against the aft galley but did not say they were injured.While we were 12 miles in trail, we had no idea we were following a heavy. Perhaps more in trail spacing for heavy and 737 types.				B737-800 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence on descent into PHX in trail of an A330.

When we opened the flight deck door, the Flight Attendant 1 informed me that the Flight Attendant 3 smelled the odor on descent about 10 minutes out from landing. The cabin crew reported that the smell was still there at gate arrival but had dissipated a bit after engine 2 shutdown.I made a pass through the cabin and definitely smelled the odor lightly by mid cabin and more heavy in the rear of the aircraft. Since I didn't have advance notice of the odor, I didn't initiate any procedures. The odor spread throughout the aircraft as we sought to isolate the source with the mechanics.I called Dispatch via SATCOM and was patched through to maintenance who in turn had the local technicians attempt to isolate the smell. Following an engine run at the gate, it became apparent that pack 2 was the origination of the odor. Pack 2 was put on MEL and we operated the flight back to ZZZ on Pack 1 alone.The smell in the cabin was better on the return flight but the smell lingered thoughout the cabin and the flight deck all the way back to ZZZ where a Technician notified us of an odor history and took the aircraft out of service.The Flight Attendant 3 reported a burning sensation in his eyes on descent into ZZZZ associated with the odor. The cabin crew double masked once the smell was noticed but reported headaches with the smell. In helping the local mechanics analyze the problem, I too felt stomach pains and an associated headache due to the odor. None of the crew ever reported feeling sick enough to be ambulatory.				Air Carrier Captain reported being notified of a 'dirty socks' odor at the arrival gate . The Flight Attendant noticed the odor during approach until gate arrival.

MSL, Crew observed 'IAS DISAGREE' and 'ALT DISAGREE' on the Primary Flight Displays, followed very shortly by Master Caution, ENG caution indicator, and both EEC 'ALTN' lights illuminated. Crew noted the Captain's airspeed to be significantly lower than the First Officer's and standby airspeed, so Captain transferred aircraft control to First Officer.Crew completed the Airspeed Unreliable memory items, and then coordinated with ATC to level at FL190 and maintain current heading to continue troubleshooting. After leveling off, Captain's airspeed showed approximately 100 knots below First Officer's and standby airspeed. Captain's altimeter showed approximately 300 ft. higher than First Officer's and standby altimeter. Crew ran the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist from the Quick Reference Checklist and Quick Reference Handbook, up to deferred items, and requested priority handling with ATC. Crew determined the First Officer's airspeed and altitude were reliable, so in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook, the First Officer re-engaged Flight Director and autopilot.After determining ZZZ3 as a suitable divert field, Crew informed ATC and Dispatch of intention to divert, and then informed Flight Attendants and Passengers of the situation. Crew then ran the EEC Alternate Mode Checklist from the Quick Reference Handbook, placing both engines in hard alternate mode. Crew also completed the diversion checklist and the deferred items from the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist. On arrival, below approximately 10,000 ft. and in VMC, Crew observed Captain's airspeed and altitude to be indicating correctly. First Officer flew an uneventful visual approach to Runway XXL and overweight landing at ZZZ3 (LGW 131,000 pounds). Taxi in to Gate X and shutdown were uneventful.				B737-700 pilot reported Captain's air speed and altitude information became erroneous in flight with icing conditions present.

This put us underneath preceding traffic 5 miles ahead, an A-321 which joined the glide slope [Runway] 16R straight in from 4000 ft. With light to non-existent winds in the lower atmosphere, the result was predictable, moderate wake turbulence consisting of several rhythmic jolts followed by several rolls of 20-30 deg bank before I was able to safely maneuver out of the wake. Positioned aircraft about a quarter mile west of localizer and climbed to approximately 3200 ft. to get out of the wake, then had to fly one dot above glide slope to stay out of the Airbus' wake as they were a bit high on their approach. Remainder of approach and landing was normal and uneventful. Submitting this report in case there are any passenger concerns or inquiries. After a smooth flight up the coast from ZZZ, I am sure a few nerves in the back were rattled.  I am not sure why ATC needed us to join the localizer at 3000 ft. If given 4000 ft, our ability to avoid the Airbus' wake would have been much improved. Alternatively, the curved path of the RNAV approach to [Runway] 16R would have mitigated our exposure time to wake turbulence. We elected to stay on the instrument approach this flight to mitigate the effects of our fatiguing schedule. In the future will give more consideration to the visual approach, even when fatigued, as a wake turbulence mitigation strategy.				B737-800 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence on approach into SEA in trail of an A321.

It was determined to be the outer layer of the window. We immediately leveled off, and asked ATC for a return. We ran the appropriate Quick Reference Handbook Checklist and Diversion Checklist. Dispatch seemed to immediately know that something wasn't right and we responded to their message confirming an air return. We notified the Flight Attendants first, then the passengers telling them exactly what had happened and why we were returning to Denver.We did not request priority handling but ATC began to refer to us as a critical aircraft so we went with that assuming that they had declared priority handling for us. We made an uneventful smooth overweight landing. There were multiple emergency vehicles lined along the runway as we landed. Logbook entries were made for both the cracked windshield, and the overweight landing specifying the smooth landing and a brakes-on speed of 65 kts. Dispatch and Maintenance Control were called at the gate. Another aircraft had been designated for the continuation of the flight. The First Officer and I determined that we were okay to continue to operate the [next] flight.				B737-700 Captain reported the First Officer's windshield cracked during climb. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

The sequence of events are as follows:Visual approach to [Runway] 24R at LAX resulted in a go around at about 200 ft. due to wake turbulence from preceding aircraft. I was Pilot Monitoring. We climbed straight ahead to 2,000 ft. Followed MA procedures timely and accurately. We were then given direct SMO and climb to 5,000 ft. Reaching 5,000 ft. and established on direct course to SMO we were alerted to traffic at about 11 o'clock. As we made visual contact we received an RA to descend. The Captain followed to RA guidance to descend to about 4,000 ft. Once clear of conflict he began a climb back to 5,000 ft. I verified with SoCal that 5,000 ft. was the target altitude. Climbing through 4,500 ft. I called 500 ft. to go. The Captain acknowledged and was attempting to level off at 5,000 ft. We went through the altitude by 500 ft. and promptly returned to 5,000 ft. We then continued to set up for the next approach. During the recovery from the RA I was monitoring the outside traffic and the energy state of the aircraft. The initial recovery resulted in a high thrust setting and nose high pitch, too much for what was required for a 1,000 ft. climb. We both recognized this. Thus the Captain allowed the aircraft to climb through the altitude by 500 ft. rather than an abrupt level off that would have certainly been distressing to the crew and passengers. We returned immediately to 5,000 ft., our assigned altitude. We were never behind the aircraft or missing anything procedurally. We were though very task saturated due to the rate at which these events did occur.During the climb back to 5,000 ft. the Captain engaged the autothrottle and the autopilot but due to the control forces on the yoke the autopilot never engaged. With time being critical this was enough to delay level off. I was monitoring many things but could have backed him up a bit better on energy management.		On climb out after a go around out of LAX, ATC issued a 'direct to SMO' clearance and a climb to 5,000 feet. In the turn we were given a traffic alert from ATC for VFR traffic. As we were about to level at 5,000 we got an RA descending us away from the traffic (RA report filed separately). When we reported the RA to ATC we were given the clearance 'climb to 5,000 [ft.] when clear'. After clear of conflict, we began a climb to 5,000 and I attempted to engage the autopilot and autothrust. The autothrust engaged but the autopilot did not, resulting in a high trust setting and a nose up pitch attitude. The FO (First Officer) and I both recognized the situation, I disconnected the autothrust and took over manual control of the aircraft, lowering the angle of attack. For passenger safety and comfort, as well as to avoid large negative G force, I applied slow, smooth, steady nose down pressure and reduced thrust, but the energy and rate of climb was too much. We ended up leveling at 5,700 before returning to 5,000. ATC did not query the altitude nor did we receive any additional TCAS alerts. No additional informationDue to the high workload and borderline chaotic environment, post go around caused by wake turbulence, post TCAS RA, I neglected to verify on the PFD (Primary Flight Display) that CMD was displayed. I believe I had inadvertent forward pressure on the control column which resulted in the autopilot not engaging. As soon as I realized my error I disconnected the autothrust and hand flew until straight and level.	Reporter stated wake encounter forced the go-around.	B737-900 flight crew reported executing a go-around from approach to LAX after encountering wake turbulence from preceding aircraft.

No location was identified. We searched the plane for any signs of smoke, none was found anywhere, lavs, rest areas, etc. While the flight attendants continued to be alert, the cockpit crew called Dispatch and were patched through to the Chief Pilot and Operations. No one had heard of a Smoke Detect without a location. Making the situation more complex was the fact that we had lithium ion batteries in the bulk cargo along with acetone, two separate DG shipments. We also had a forward cargo fan deferred. It was decided that if we could not reset the Smoke Detect message to confirm if it was still active, we would divert to ZZZ. If there was indeed smoke detected, we were diverting to ZZZ1. At no point was smoke detected by the Flight Attendants. Operations offered a technique to reset the Flight Safety Organization panel, but it only reset the lighting and cabin temperature aspects of the system, it did not remove the smoke detect message from the screen.The flight attendants were fantastic throughout the event. We had three brand new flight attendants, the Purser has been working for [the] Company for 2 months. He handled the situation quite well. Name was particularly helpful. He researched the problem and found a reset in the manual. His problem was that the manual did not describe the location of the buttons suggested in the reset. He continued to search the cabin and found the buttons referenced at door 1R. I asked him to proceed with the reset procedure he found in his manual and the Smoke Detect message was cleared from all screens. The message did not reappear. Dispatch, the Chief Pilot, and Operations all agreed the situation was resolved and the flight continued to ZZZ2. The entire crew agreed and we continued uneventfully.All crew worked extremely well together, CRM was used throughout the entire event which lasted more than an hour. Name and Name 1 really saved the day on this one.				B777-300 Captain reported a CAS 'smoke Detect' message during cruise. After a cabin search no smoke was identified. Flight crew conferred with Dispatch and Maintenance and elected to continue to destination. Flight landed safely.

Upon landing we cleared the runway and accomplished the brake cooling module. Calculations returned safe numbers for brake cooling to return to the gate. Confirmed no outside indications that the aircraft was unsafe to take back to the gate. We returned to the gate, performed the Parking Checklist and offloaded the passengers in accordance to normal procedures.

Shortly after departure, we were cleared direct ZZZZZ and climb to FL210. About 6000 ft. MSL, the First Officer, Pilot Flying, began adding rudder trim. A few seconds later, the auto-throttles disengaged and the aircraft began to increase yaw. We looked at the number 2 engine instruments and saw N1 gauge about 55 percent and Fuel Flow around 3000 pounds per hour. EEC's (Electronic Engine Control) were normal. We leveled off at 9000 ft. and began to assess the situation. The amber ENG FAIL annunciator appeared on the upper Display Unit. I called for the Engine Failure Checklist in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). I requested priority handling with ZZZ departure and requested radar vectors while we ran checklists. We notified Dispatch, through ZZZ Operations, communicated with the Flight Attendants and notified the passengers that we were returning to ZZZ for a mechanical issue. Landing data was acquired, one engine inoperative flaps 15 landing. Auto Brakes 3 were selected. Once landing data and the Engine Failure Checklist was complete, up to the one Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist, the First Officer transferred the controls to me for the landing. Flaps 15 landing was made uneventful. We stopped the aircraft in order to have ARF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) assess the condition of the aircraft and run brake cooling numbers. We were given the all clear by ARF. Brake cooling allowed us to taxi to the gate. Maintenance met the aircraft and a logbook entry was made. After aircraft was deplaned, I had a conference call with the Chief Pilot on call, Dispatch, Maintenance Control, and Manager.		Departed ZZZ1 on Aircraft X at (time) on (date) via the ZZZZZ Departure, Runway XXL with myself acting as PF (Pilot Flying). [It was an] uneventful take-off and received vectors towards [the] ZZZZZ intersection and eventually direct to ZZZZZ. While climbing through about 6000 ft., the aircraft felt as if it needed rudder adjustment. As I began to adjust the rudder, I noticed that the number 2 engine had rolled back to about 55 percent N1. We immediately started to analyze the situation utilizing CRM. Within seconds, the autothrottle kicked off and the engine continued to operate at reduced N1. EEC's (Electronic Engine Control) showed normal position. At about the same time, the engine failed and Captain Name called for the Engine Failure Checklist. We coordinated that he would run the checklist and I would continue to fly the aircraft. We had leveled off at 9000 ft. and at this point, requested to turn back towards ZZZ1 and descend. We were approved to descend to 5000 ft. and vectored toward ZZZ1. Captain coordinated with ZZZ1 Departure for time and vectors to run our required checklists, as well as providing them with fuel and souls on board information. We continued through the checklist as we were vectored through final for Runway XYR. Completed the checklist as well as getting landing data and determining that we would not be an overweight landing. Discussed single-engine go-around procedures in addition for the need to calculate hot-brake numbers after landing. Turned back towards the extended center line for Runway XYR and descended. During this time frame, Captain called to inform and coordinate with the FA's (Flight Attendant), creating an excellent shared mental model.Received vectors for intercepting the localizer, while configuring for our flaps 15 landing. At about this time, I transferred control of the aircraft to [the] Captain. Landing was uneventful and smooth and we were able to stop prior to turnoff for Taxiway 1. After turnoff, CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) Personnel, who inspected the aircraft and noted no hot spots on the engine or brakes, met us. Computed the hot brakes data and noted that we could taxi back to the gate with no restrictions and a cool-down time of 40 minutes, 25M foot lbs. Upon returning to the gate, Captain did an excellent job of greeting every Passenger and thanking them for their understanding and cooperation.		B737-800 flight crew reported an engine failure in flight. The flight crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

The FMC option disappeared from both CDU MENU screens. Both moving maps stopped, all performance data was removed and the autopilot defaulted to CWS roll (as anticipated) when the navigation data became unavailable. We began the process of verify raw data navigation when both FMC computers came back online and proceeded to operate normally. Operationally, we called Operations Control and Maintenance Control and concurred that we were safe to continue. Basic navigation was unaffected and so the safety of flight was not reduced in the event it happened again. However, it does seem to qualify as a serious impact on aircraft systems -- especially since the design redundancy did not work (both sides failed simultaneously). Because the system reset itself normally and did not repeat the fault, it qualified as an INFO-ITEM and the AML entry was made in ZZZ, but the event also appears to qualify as a mandatory report. The description is the same verbiage used in the report. There were no additional factors that indicated the reason that both FMC computers would simultaneous shutdown and then simultaneously restart. No turbulence, we were not interacting with either CDU at the time, nothing. The event is very strange since it caused a breakdown in the 'design through redundancy' principle.Simultaneous failure of redundant systems is a bigger problem than 'an anomaly'. We happened to be in cruise within VOR and VHF range. If this had happened at a more critical time of flight-- where time critical usage of the FMC is greater-- this would have been a larger problem. If this had happened when we were beyond VOR/VHF range, this would have also caused a more serious impact on flight safety. When the FMC computers went offline, we had no access to GPS or IRS navigation data. We also lost all access to FMC performance data. Finding the cause and correcting it appears to be a high priority.				B737-800 flight crew reported dual FMC failure inflight. Failure was short lived, as FMC's reset in approximately 25 seconds.

The IDG (Integrated drive generator) had not been disconnected at that time and the MEL instructed to only turn it off if directed by the ECAM (Electronic centralized aircraft monitor). After pushback, Assigned EDCT (estimated departure clearance time) XA:45 local. Single engine (#1) taxi to Northwest Hold pad and engine shut down to conserve fuel using only the APU. XA:35 started both engines and accomplished after start checklist associated with MEL. Just prior to taxi we received an amber ECAM message (ELEC IDG 2 Oil Low PR) instructing us to turn off IDG 2. Capt called maintenance control to confirm they wanted the IDG disconnected. They advised us to follow the ECAM. After the IDG 2 was turned off, the ECAM disappeared and the IDG was correctly showing DISC on the ELEC page. Maintenance control advised us we were safe to proceed. We continued as planned and departed ZZZ. While climbing on the departure the same ECAM reappeared. Attempted to disconnect the IDG again following ECAM and Quick Reference Handbook procedures. Momentarily showed DISC again only to re-engage seconds later. At that point Captain assigned pilot flying duties and radios to me. He used crew phone app on his iPad to call maintenance control to trouble shoot the problem. They attempted to disengage the IDG two more times without success. Captain in concurrence with maintenance control made the decision to return to ZZZ for an overweight landing. Accomplished all associated Quick Reference Handbook procedures, notifications and land assessment. Declared priority with approach control and requested airport rescue and firefighting. Successful landing with no further issues or instances. Canceled priority once clear of the runway and taxied to the gate. IDG 2 failure to disconnect after multiple attempts. Not sure if it could've been avoided. Prior to takeoff aircraft was showing all correct indications. System failure to disconnect IDG 2 correctly in flight.		MEL XX-XX-# was applied to this aircraft. After the second engine start, we received an ECAM (Electronic centralized aircraft monitor) directing us to disconnect 2 IDG (Integrated drive generator). We contacted maintenance crew and after their concurrence we disconnected IDG 2. I questioned whether this would work given the MEL already had GEN 2 OFF, but the ELEC page confirmed the IDG was disconnected. We departed and on the climb out, the IDG came back online with a ECAM directing us to disconnect it again. I contacted maintenance crew via the Dispatcher using the crew phone app. At this point, the IDG ECAM was going on and off multiple times. I again selected the IDG off at the direction of maintenance crew (we tried this 3 times). The IDG would not stay disconnected. I again questioned whether the GEN 2 being offline had anything to do with it, but they didn't seem to think I so. Maintenance crew requested a return to CLT. With Dispatcher concurrence, we returned to CLT. We requested priority handling with CLT approach due to our overweight landing and had safety vehicles standing by. We landed smoothly 4,000 lbs overweight. We cleared the runway, cancelled our priority handling and proceeded to the gate. We swapped aircraft and proceeded to ZZZ without further incident. I'm of the opinion that an aircraft with this type of MEL should not be dispatched to non maintenance stations, and definitely not to a small island in the Caribbean. This MEL was a Category B on day 2 of the 3 day repair window and being an IDG (red guarded switch) added an additional level of stress when working through procedure. This situation could have been avoided. Just because the MEL allows Dispatch to a station doesn't make it smart.		A320 flight crew reported a #2 IDG failure to disconnect when selected multiple times. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and make a precautionary landing at departure airport.

Checked gear status and noted number 6 wheel tire pressure AMBER 84 PSI and decreasing 40 PSI then 1 PSI. Adjacent wheel 5 AMBER 245 PSI. Continued climb out as planned. Climbing through 10,000 feet MSL cleared by ATC to maintain 270 Knots. Continued as planned on course to ZZZ. After climbing through FL 180 notified Purser not to commence inflight service. Leveled off at FL330. Completed non normal unannunciated checklist procedure for tire pressure -tire fail checklist. Then ZZZZZ Dispatch approaching ZZZ, discussed options, continue or ZZZ1. At this point brought Purser into the loop and I made the decision to ZZZ1. Purser returned to cabin to brief crew and run precautionary landing check list I made a preparatory brief to passengers. ZZZZZ Dispatch to confirm plan to ZZZ1. Dispatch calculated our fuel dump and return fuel for landing. Notified ATC of our intentions to dump fuel and request priority handling and return to ZZZ1. ATC turned us south and away from weather. At XB:22Z we began to dump 65,500 pounds of fuel, IAH 090/80nm FL330. Fuel dump time 27 minutes. ATC gave us a turn to the west and descent to FL300. Fuel dump complete XB:50Z FL300 100nm southeast of ZZZ. Confirmed priority with ATC XB:55Z. Center cleared us direct ZZZ1. Descent arrival and approach to Runway 36R normal planned landing with 30 flaps no auto brakes as per checklist to land below max landing weight. Slight yaw to left as main landing gear contact the runway as expected with a flat tire, stopped on runway, inspected by ZZZ1 ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting), confirmed wheel six tire flat no other complicating issues in progress, then cleared the runway. ZZZ1 ARFF remained with the aircraft until we were towed to gate. In congruence with ZZZ1 ARFF terminated priority handling with ZZZ1 Tower at XD:35Z.We were reluctant to dump the fuel and actually considered in the ZZZZZ three way with Dispatch and maintenance to continue on to MAD. However, when including Purser into the loop, who has actually first hand knowledge with vision of the physical condition of the passengers we were carrying- first thing Purser asked? No problem with this aircraft getting into alternate for a medical divert? Our ALTNs were OK but not great. Decision was made there to ZZZ1. Then later in this event as we were just about to terminate the fuel dump. Received a message from maintenance to Dispatch to us that 'Company aircraft maintain real time computer shows tires pressures fine just bad aircraft sensor all good you can relax." Bad info. And last of great concern, brought to my attention by Purser, our flight was knowing Dispatched without a FA language speaker. Very interesting flight, great crew, time permitting, I really feel its important to bring Purser into the loop onto flight deck if the situations time constraints allow.		Departing ZZZ Runway 35L. Once airborne at approximately 800 feet we had a tire pressure alert. Checked gear synopsis page and wheel number 6 was amber and 80 psi and decreasing to finally stop at 1 psi. After 10,000 feet we requested 270 knots, gear speed and continued on flight plan while we discussed the problem. Leveled off at FL330 and completed applicable check lists. Contacted Dispatch and discussed tire press issue and options. We discussed the options: to ZZZ1 or continue. Then CA asked Purser to come to the flight deck to discuss her concerns. We had concerns about continuing to ZZZ2 with diversion options with a flat tire and Purser was concerned with diversion for passenger medical priority. We discussed how would need to request priority handling no matter where we landed. We also discussed fatigue being a factor if we brought the priority to ZZZ2 vs landing ZZZ without the fatigue factor. We all agreed that ZZZ was the safest option for dealing with the flat tire on landing. We requested priority handling with ZZZ3 ATC and advised we needed to jettison fuel. We were then given vectors over the Gulf of Mexico where we began fuel jettison procedures at FL330. Once fuel jettison was complete and weight was below max landing weight we were given vectors back to ZZZ. We requested ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) on arrival at ZZZ. Approach and landing was uneventful. ARFF informed us that we did have a flat but intact tire and requested left engine to be shut down for closer inspection. ARFF gave us all clear and CA taxied clear of runway. We requested a tow in from that point to gate. Once at the gate, the priority handling was terminated and PAX and crew deplaned normally. I was the relief pilot on this trip. The CA did a great job of asking for our input as well as the Pursers input. We discussed pros and cons of continuing to ZZZ2. We all agreed that landing at ZZZ was the safest option for passenger, crew, and aircraft. The first officer did a great job flying the aircraft while the CA and I made radio calls, spoke to flight attendants and passengers. It would be good to know why the tire went flat.		B777 flight crew reported a tire pressure EICAS message on takeoff. The flight crew elected to request priority handling and dump fuel. An air turn back and precautionary landing were them performed.

The smell could be described as burning oil, acrid and very chemically in nature. After what must have been just a couple seconds, the First Officer (FO) asked, 'do you smell that?' After which, we both donned our O2 masks and continued the approach and landing. Note, the O2 masks remained on until reaching the gate where upon engine shut down the cockpit windows were opened for ventilation. Upon removing our oxygen masks, we did not smell any of the odors as described above in the cockpit. After this, we asked the F1 if they smelled anything out of the ordinary on the approach--they did not. Upon recording the event in the aircraft logbook, I was selected for a drug test, and the FO departed for the crew room. In regards to the aircraft configuration at the time of the fume / odor event: the aircraft was in a managed descent descending through 5,000 ft. with thrust at idle, and flaps in configuration 1. The APU was placed on MEL (for fume / odor event) and both PACKS were ON. The Cockpit Odor Report was completed later that evening.				Air Carrier Captain reported a fumes event during approach. The odor was described as a 'burning oil and acrid'. Flight crew donned oxygen masks and executed a safe landing. Upon gate arrival an aircraft logbook entry was submitted to maintenance.

The APU was running, but they smelled the odor prior to the APU bleed being turned on. The odor persisted during the deboarding. I called [Maintenance Control] and local Maintenance came out. I agreed to help troubleshoot by completing 2 engine runs with guidance from the local technicians. Through isolation troubleshoot procedures we determined that the odor existed when either Eng 1 or APU bleed were supplying either or both packs. Maintenance Control and local Maintenance decided to defer both the Eng 1 and APU bleed. After landing in ZZZ on the return flight, the inflight crew notified me that they again experienced the odor during descent at approximately 18k ft.				A320 Captain reported being notified by the flight attendant crew during deplaning of a dirty socks odor in the passenger cabin. After maintenance action was taken, the flight was subsequently completed and the Captain was again notified of odor during descent.

Flaps ceased to move beyond flaps 10 degrees. We elected to go around and requested vectors to run the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) and opted not to accept holding instructions due to the fact that the autopilot would not engage. Ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree and continued to be vectored southwest of the field until ready for approach on the long Runway (XX). Captain elected to [request priority handling] and I agreed. Insufficient time to notify Dispatch.  very busy right seat due to no autopilot. Captain flew the aircraft and got the radios. Non-normal performance data was loaded and we continued the approach following QRH guidelines. There was some discussion about the speeds, but in the end it was agreed that the speeds were correct. Flaps were extended to 15 using alternate flap extension procedure. QRH finished to completion prior to landing. I notified Flight Attendants of the malfunction and Passengers subsequently as well during the vectoring. Flight Attendants were very professional and informative. Asked Tower to roll the trucks just in case. Landing was uneventful. We taxied off the runway and had trucks conduct visual inspection of the aircraft. After that, and brake cooling calculation, we decided it was safe to taxi to the gate. Passengers and In-flight Crew were very positive after opening the cockpit door. I think I heard applause from the back during landing roll-out.After speaking with the Captain one day after this event, he said he had called the Company to discuss further in depth regarding the failure.  At the time of the event it was impossible to ascertain what caused the flaps to cease normal operation.  Captain subsequently described his conversation with Maintenance and explained that they stated two of the flap transmissions had seized. This in turn prevented autopilot engagement.  Perhaps that is why we always hand fly no flap or reduced flap approaches during training?  I am not sure how we could have prevented the flaps from seizing. It's becoming clear to me that the fleet is aging as more and more mechanical issues crop up.		On approach, flaps would not extend past 10 degrees. A go-around was executed and neither autopilot was able to be utilized. I may have placed too much force on the controls during the multiple times I tried to utilize either autopilot and ended up hand flying the aircraft during the event. QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) was followed, delay vectors were provided by ATC, and a Flaps 15 Landing was executed. Task load was high and managed. We elected to focus our communications time to ATC, the Flight Attendants, and Passengers when time was available and decided that we could notify the Company once on the ground.If neither autopilot was actually available, then I think we handled the situation well.  If the autopilot was available, then we need to understand that in a compressed situation, even the slightest perceived force on the control wheel may be greater then we normally judge.		B737 Flight crew reported trailing edge flap failure during approach. The flight crew performed a go around and landed at destination airport.

In the carry forward items section of the release there was a long time fault with the #1 EEC. Then in the log history on Day 0 the aircraft had a leading edge flaps transit light stays on write up. There were a series of write ups with the flaps in the history saying #2 transit light on. The first one starting on Day 0, then Day 1 was the second occurrence, then Day 2, then on our flight on Day 3. All of these write ups had the leading edge flaps transit light on. We did discuss this history together before the flight.Normal flight up until top of descent point. Thunderstorms were starting to pop up into central [state] and there was holding into one of the airports, we think it was ZZZ1. Frequency was very saturated and difficult to get any word with ZZZ2 center or Center. We asked for lower 4 times on frequency before given our first descent and that this point we were 5000+ feet high on the arrival. When finally given descent via ZZZZZ1 landing east we told ATC we would be do are best but were already very high. Speeds on the arrival were complied with and full speed brakes were used from the TOD which was my best guess FL350 down to a cleared to bottom of 6,000 feet. When we switched to approach we were vectored off the arrival for traffic and told to maintain 6,000 feet. Approach gave us a vector off the arrival and then vectored us on ILS approach course. Thunder storms were building all around ZZZ and there were some buildups and rain that we went through when being vectored and re-vectored onto the arrival. At some point during these vectors back onto the ILS Runway XXL approach course we were given a speed reduction to 210 knots. This occurred somewhere on the base leg to final. At that time the Captain called for flaps 1. All indications with the Flap position indicator showed flaps 1, the handle was at flaps 1, but the LE Flaps transit light was still illuminated. A quick glance up at the Leading Edge Devices annunciator panel showed 1 amber light, the rest were green. The amber light was located on the left hand side underneath the flaps 1 number at the top of the annunciator. We were concerned with the approaching thunderstorms to the ZZZ airport so I pulled out the paper Quick Reference Handbook and we began running through the procedure while continuing on the approach. Went to the flight controls tab, then the leading edge flaps transit light page read the notes out loud quickly and then read through point 1 where it gives you the option to choose 1. We read through the first one and ruled it out and had a quick discussion that were was no roll or any indication of any asymmetry. Read the second one and again after some quick discussion agreed it was our problem. Went to step 7 and started to plan for a flaps 15 landing. We set Vref 15 +15 knots. This is where I made an initial error. I selected flaps 15 Vref speed and then put +15 in the wind additive so I think the flaps 15 speed was 160 and I put the plus 15 in the wind additive for a speed of 165 knots initially. Then step 9 is use normal wind additive winds were like 150@9 at the time so would of been + 5 but I did not change anything at this point. Step 10 is to put the ground proximity flap inhibit switch to inhibit so I confirmed that with the Captain and did that. Somewhere right in here we got are last turn on to the approach course and were cleared for the approach. The next step was to calculate landing distance so I had to go to my IPAD this the tables are removed in the Quick Reference Handbook for that. Hit they hyperlinks for the 900ER and found the table and read out the landing distance first for the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry Flap lever 15 and then I realized this was not the right table and found the Leading edge flaps transit flaps 15 aircraft condition. We were approximately 145,000 pounds so I read out 5,000 feet needed for good braking and 7,000 for medium. I then looked at the adjustments to landing distance and the only one that applied was the add per C above ISA and it was minimal. Then went to step 3 for the 15% safety margin and if it went down to medium braking we needing about 8,200 feet of runway and less than 6,000 feet for good. The rain was not hitting the airport currently so we expected to have 600 braking. The runway is listed as 9,000 feet long on the 10-9 and 8,400 ft. available beyond the threshold. I did all this as fast as I could and while we were intercepting the glide slope and starting down on the approach. All through this the center and approach frequencies were completely saturated with constant communication from ATC to other aircraft and us with no real significant breaks between radio transmissions. I read aloud steps 13 and 14 and then went right into the deferred items because we were at that point already. Captain called for gear and flaps 15 somewhere in the middle of the deferred items checklist we finished the checklist somewhere between 1,500 feet and 1,000 feet. Captain asked if we were good and we both agreed we were to continue the approach. I double checked the whole procedure reading it quickly through again and realized I set the flaps 15 speed wrong so by the I think Vref 15 was 149 I added the 15 knots to 164 and put that in on the speed line and then changed the wind additive to +5 so we had an approach speed of 169. I did this right before we were at 1,000 feet. At some point during all of that we were switched over to Tower and cleared to land. There was a corporate jet on the runway and he was being told told we were fast approaching and to vacate the runway. Then given expedite instructions and then a little above 500 feet. tower issued go around instructions to us.We were given a heading slightly off from runway heading an initial climb to 2,000 feet Captain gave all the correct go around commands we went to heading select and flew the Tower assigned heading, we had a discussion of the missed approach instructions because Captain wanted to make sure he heard them correctly and also a discussion about going all the way to clean maneuvering speed or leaving flaps down. Captain wanted to try and recycle the flaps to see if we got the light again. So we did go all the way to flaps up and after takeoff. Eventually Tower gave us a turn to the downwind and a climb to 4,000 feet and switched us back over to approach. Approach re-vectored us on to the course for another ILS XXL approach. Captain redid an abbreviated approach brief and then we selected flaps 1 again and go the LE Flaps transit light. We went through the Quick Reference Handbook again and completed all the steps to the deferred item landing checklist. We completed the deferred item checklist after the gear was selected down and that finished the procedure. While being vectored I did let approach know that we were going to have a final approach speed of 170 knots we never [requested priority handling] or let any outside source know of the flap system malfunction. Our main concern was getting into the field before the thunderstorms passed over it. Captain made an uneventful flaps 15 landing. We exited at [taxiway] 1 and were told to go straight to ramp and ramp told us to go into [the gate]. We complied with instructions and safely parked. Completed the parking checklist and then called ops to let them know of the maintenance problem and Captain put the write up into the ELB.				B737 First Officer reported operating an aircraft with a long history of leading edge flap asymmetry discrepancies. This aircraft had a repeat discrepancy occur during approach to landing. The flight crew performed a go around and complied with the QRH procedures and rejoined the approach and landing at destination airport.

We completed a preflight inspection and aircraft setup for our return to ZZZ1. After takeoff we raised the gear handle and soon after got a gear disagree EICAS message due to the left landing gear. We completed the non normal checklist for gear disagree. Then we advised ATC of the problem and contacted Dispatch. We were advised by Dispatch to return to ZZZ. We lowered the gear normally on the approach with no further issues. Once parked, maintenance inspected the left gear and found one gear pin installed with no flag attached to it. The maintenance logbook entry did say that all gear pins had been removed. The First Officer had done the walk around inspection and did not see the pin in the gear possibly due to it missing a flag attached to it. Four other maintenance personnel advised us they had also looked and didn't see the pin as well.Four local maintenance personnel inspected the aircraft. They annotated in the logbook that they had pulled all gear pins. The First Officer walked around the aircraft and did not observe the pin in the gear. It appears there may not have been a gear pin flag attached to the pin. The flag wasn't there upon return. The aircraft had been in a non Company facility for around a month for new paint. The walk around inspection following long term maintenance requires extra diligence. Additionally, during the walk around inspection instead of just looking for the gear pins, look for the empty hole where the pins would be.		After landing at ZZZ we tail swapped into an aircraft coming out of the paint shop. We discussed the need for a through preflight, paying note to the static ports, pitot tubes etc and I as FO (first officer) conducted the exterior and supernumerary area preflight. The weather was broken clouds, daylight hours. After takeoff we raised the gear and soon received a gear disagree EICAS message due to landing gear disagree (left main). We notified ATC, leveled at 10,000 ft and maintained airspeed 250 kts. We completed the non normal checklist for gear disagree. We contacted Dispatch and they recommended we return to ZZZ.  On downside for Runway XX we lowered the gear and received a normal gear down indication, landing without incident. Once parked, maintenance inspected the left main and found one gear pin installed, without a gear pin flag attached to it. The ARD (Airworthiness Release Document) indicated that Maintenance had removed and stowed all gear pins. I as FO had completed the walk around and did not see the pin still installed. Maintenance informed us that four of their maintenance team had each conducted individual walk around's and none of the four that inspected the aircraft noticed the gear pin was still installed.   Four local maintenance personnel had inspected the aircraft individually.  They annotated in the ARD (aircraft release) that they had pulled and stowed all the gear pins. I, as FO had walked around the aircraft and did not observe the pin still installed. It appears there may not have been a gear flag attached to the gear pin based on the fact there was no flag attached to it, making it challenging to see. The aircraft came out of a non Company facility after significant work.  All walk around's require a through inspection, however out of a non company city, it's fair to say extra diligence is required.  Additionally, during walk around's instead of looking for pins and or flags, it would be better to look for an empty gear pin hole instead.		B777-200 flight crew reported one landing gear would not retract after take off. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and a precautionary landing at departure airport. An inspection discovered one landing gear safety pin still installed.

At around 35,000 ft on climb out, and prior to cruise, the FO (First Officer) asked if he could go back to the lavatory. I called back to the a FA and got his restroom break set up. While waiting for the 'ok to come out' callback from the a FA, the FO vomited all over the center control pedestal and my right side. After a few seconds to realize what had just happened, I made sure the aircraft was still operating normally (Autopilot B and a VNAV level off to cruise at 37,000 ft). The FO was obviously terribly embarrassed, but he was able to act as my Pilot Monitoring for the rest of the flight. He was not incapacitated, but I instructed him that I would take over as Pilot Flying. I wanted him to just be a very thorough PM (pilot monitoring) for the rest of the flight to back me up with my additional tasks.I then called the A FA again to let them know what had happened, and that we would need some additional galley supplies for an attempted clean up. While attempting to use the intercom, we realized that the entire communications system (VHF 1, VHF 2, intercom, both CA (Captain) and FOs Audio Control panels, headsets, and hand mics) was either failed or working incorrectly. One of the radio transmitters developed an intermittent stuck mike, yet none of the microphone transmit keys anywhere in the cockpit were being pressed. We were unable to transmit on either VHF 1 or 2, but could intermittently receive and transmit on ATIS on VHF 2. We attempted every possible transmitter/receiver combination we could think of, calls in the blind, etc. While I was doing that, the FO was in the Quick Reference Handbook reviewing to see if anything was directly applicable in the Communications or General sections. Since this was not working, I decided to use my authority to ensure a safe outcome. I set the transponder, and sent Dispatch an ACARS briefly explaining what was going on. I asked them for priority on our behalf, and advised we would continue to ZZZ via the filed route and fly the RNAV RNP M with our ETA. Amidst all this going on, the FO mentioned trying to put the Audio Control Panel into Alternate Mode (which forces VHF 1 to the CA side only, disables interphone, etc). When I put the CAs ACP (Audio Control Panel) into Alternate Mode, I was able to regain intermittent transmit ability on VHF 1. We then contacted Center, explained what was going on, and advised them of our plan in the event we lost communications further along in the flight. I then called the flight attendants, explained what was going on, and did a test briefing at the end to make sure we were all on the same page. I then made 2 PAs to the cabin. The first was the standard 'prior to descent/goodbye PA', the second a few minutes later was an explanation that they could possibly see some priority vehicles near the aircraft on arrival. I simply explained that we had a radio malfunction, but the aircraft was safe and that we would be landing shortly. The FO and I then completed all the normal approach checklists and procedures. The descent, approach, and landing were routine and safe. Since VHF 1 was working intermittently, I was able to get a handoff from Center to ZZZ Tower. I told Tower we would be unable to make any of the ZZZ Channel Traffic calls, so he asked another plane to do it for us and kept the GA traffic off the final approach course for Runway 8. We arrived at the gate, and the FO was met by ZZZ paramedics for evaluation. I spoke with the ZZZ gate agents, and then wrote up the inoperative equipment in the logbook for ZZZ maintenance. I then called Dispatch, the FODO (Flight Operations Duty Officer), and completed this required report.				B737-700 flight crew reported communication equipment problems following pilot illness incident.

ATC was clearly struggling and confused as they pulled us off the STAR and initially gave us direct to ZZZ VOR. They then gave us a heading, and contradictory and confusing holding instructions followed. At one point they simply said just stay north of ZZZ VOR--that was the extent of the holding instructions. Shortly after we were given direct to ZZZZZ and a descent to 14000, cross ZZZZZ at FL 200. We had to query ATC numerous times to confirm that they wanted us to do the ZZZZZ XX [arrival] for a Runway XXL landing vice ZZZZZ XY [arrival] for Runway YYR, which we had deduced on our own during a lack of information from ATC or ATIS.  ZZZZZ XX for Runway XXL was finally confirmed. Inside ZZZZZ and at approximately 15000 altitude, ATC asked if we could proceed direct to fix ZZZZZ1. This is the standard merge point for the STAR and turns to this point are routine, however this was earlier than normal for the turn. We determined we could accept the clearance. Shortly after we were cleared to descend to 10000. On the STAR the altitude for ZZZZZ1 is 12000. At this point I made a horrible assumption-- having never landed from the east on Runway XX at ZZZZ, I assumed this was normal operations. I could clearly see the ground all the way down the valley to the airport at this point. I deselected weather radar on my ND (Navigation Display) and selected the Terrain display, oriented the chart terrain on the ND which appeared to be well to our left,  and thus I continued the descent below 12000. The FO (First Officer) and I discussed the EGPWS terrain painting to our left, and that we appeared to be completely clear of terrain along our track to the runway. Shortly we started painting green EGPWS terrain in front of us, which very quickly started turning yellow. I was just verbalizing that I was no longer comfortable, but had not acted yet when we received a 'Caution, Terrain' EGPWS verbal warning. The FO recalls that it was not this EGPWS verbal caution but a 'Pull up Terrain' GPWS warning. I immediately disconnected the autopilot, selected TOGA thrust, and pitched toward full back stick. The EGPWS terrain that was displaying disappeared nearly immediately, the warning never repeated, and we were level at 12000 in about 20 seconds. I made a mistake here in that because we were visual and apparently cleared the threat so rapidly, I did not do the complete EGPWS Terrain procedure and never pitched to full back stick, which would have been appropriate since it was night time. The FO informed ATC that we had climbed to 12000, and they cleared us to maintain 12000 until ZZZZZ1 and cleared us for the ILS Z Runway XX. I reconnected the AP and autothrottles, re-armed the approach mode, and we conducted an ILS to Runway XXL followed by a sidestep landing on Runway XXR.Numerous lessons here for me. At the outset of the apparent struggles by ATC prior to our descent, we had correctly surmised that the airport had changed to Runway XX due to the thunderstorms interfering with Runway YYR. We thoroughly briefed the descent and approach to Runway XX in addition to Runway YY while we awaited a firm descent and runway assignment. I thought we had recovered well from all the confusion thrown at us early in the arrival, but I had clearly not and was still preoccupied with it. We briefed from the mountain flying guide that ATC may give you a clearance off the route and not ensure terrain clearance with the altitude assignment. This was in my mind as we descended below 12000 per instructions, but I did not verbalize it. I succumbed to my unfamiliarity with Runway XX, my disbelief that ATC could actually give us an unsafe altitude clearance, and it was all supported by what I initially was seeing visually outside the aircraft. In the back of my mind I knew staying at 12000 was what we should do, but I did not think clearly for those several minutes while collecting our thoughts and adjusting to a challenging evolution.				A320 flight crew reported receiving a 'pull up' terrain warning while descending on arrival at night in a mountainous area. The flight crew executed an immediate climb and continued the arrival.

Other than the flight being operated late due to ZZZ1 congestion and delays, the flight was uneventful up until this event. I was the PF during the incident. ZZZ approach vectored us to join the Runway XX ILS final approach course, and we intercepted as planned.  Subsequently cleared for the ILS XX approach, handed off to ZZZ Tower and cleared to land on Runway XX.  We flew a stabilized approach without incident. Upon the 500 Ft Stable callout, I noticed in my peripheral vision a large aircraft (which turned out to be a A-350) holding in position on Runway YYR. I do not recall hearing a takeoff clearance for this aircraft, as the tower may have been in a 'split operation'. Winds were reported to be approximately 030/15G25. Evidently the A-350 had been cleared for takeoff, unbeknownst to me or my First Officer. At approximately 100 feet AGL, significant turbulence/jet blast was encountered with a brief period of loss of aircraft control. Full left sidestick deflection was made with the aircraft still rolling right due to the jet blast. The event subsided as quickly as it began, with aircraft control being regained and a normal touchdown occurred within the touchdown zone, slightly right of centerline. An inquiry was made after touchdown and tower stated that the A-350 had indeed been cleared for takeoff. We subsequently cleared the runway and taxied to the gate without incident. Upon reaching the gate, I made a phone call to the tower supervisor, and he was very apologetic for the incident and was going to look into the event.				A320 Captain reported a loss of control event during landing at approximately 100 ft. AGL when jet blast from an aircraft departing a nearby runway was encountered. Aircraft control was regained and the flight continued to landing.

After selecting flaps 1, Autopilot A kicked off. I started to hand fly, and we noticed the lower amber band was above the flaps 1 maneuver bug. We selected flaps 5, the amber band did not move and then the First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) noticed the amber LE FLAPS TRANSIT was illuminated and flaps indicated < 1. We requested delay vectors from ATC and I transferred the plane and radios to the First Officer.  We settled on the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook. The alternate flap extension moved the flaps only to just above 1. We pulled up flap 1 data on the ACARS, and also referred to flaps up data provided by Dispatch to ensure we were able to safely land on Runway XXL. The approach and landing we uneventful, taxing clear at Taxiway N with normal braking. After parking we noticed the Proximity Electronics Unit light. Just request priority handling when dealing with flap issues, we initially did not and then got deep in the checklist and setting up for the approach and didn't think about it again.				First officer reported a Leading Edge Flaps in Transit light on approach. The flight crew requested vectors for troubleshooting and to perform the QRH procedures. The flight crew then resumed the approach to landing at destination airport.

The Purser called shortly thereafter indicating a very loud sound coming from Door 1R. We continued the climb to our cruise altitude of FL340. In an attempt to alleviate the noise we descended to FL300 with no change. We then descended to FL280 with no change. The CA (Captain) conferred with Dispatch, Maintenance Control and the FAs (Flight Attendants) and the decision was made to return to ZZZ. We ran the diversion and recovery checklists as well as the overweight landing checklist. Due to the overweight landing we requested priority handling. The CA took the PF (Pilot Flying) role for the remainder of the flight. The diversion and landing proceeded uneventfully.		Flight departed ZZZ enroute to ZZZ1. Climbing through FL 310 to FL 340, a loud ''air-horn' like noise could be heard in the cockpit coming from the cabin. Shortly thereafter, the Purser called from the forward galley notifying us of the loud sound coming from Door 1R. Cabin pressurization parameters were normal and stable. Reaching FL340 the sound increased in intensity and we descended to FL300 and then FL 280. The sound lessened in volume at FL280 although the noise was still significant. Concurrently, we conferred with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and elected to return to ZZZ. Descending into ZZZ and passing FL260, the sound dissipated. We requested priority handling and accomplished an overweight landing on Runway XX successfully. The aircraft taxied to the gate uneventfully.		Flight crew reported a buzzing noise from the L1 door on climb. The crew elected to perform an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

We were flying a 737-700, which has a flaps 30 speed of 165 kts. We were told to maintain 180 kts. to FAF, which occurred at about 1,500 ft. AGL. We therefore had approximately 500 ft. to slow the aircraft and select flaps 30 to meet stabilized approach criteria.The Pilot Flying (PF) requested gear down and flaps 15 approaching glide slope intercept. As I was doing OE, my focus was on watching the FO slow down to 165 kts. so we could select flap 30. I did not notice that when selected to 15, the flaps had stopped at about 8 degrees. When the FO requested flaps 30 and landing check, I ran the checklist and saw that the flaps were not at 30. By this time we were at 1,100 ft. AGL. I instructed the FO to initiate a missed approach and informed Tower that we were going around due to a system malfunction. The missed approach was well flown by the FO, and I felt comfortable having him continue to fly while I worked the problem, and I set the speed at 200 kts., so not to over speed or stress the flaps. I called back and told the Flight Attendants that we had a malfunction and would need a few minutes before returning to land and that I would call back when I had time and brief them more comprehensively. I made a PA to the passengers that we had an abnormal indication and we would return to land as soon as we had finished our checklists, and that there was no reason to be concerned. I then sent an ACARS message to dispatch alerting them that were would request priority handling due to a flap issue.We completed the QRH procedures, then requested priority handling with ATC, as we would be landing in a non-normal configuration. I called back to the Flight Attendants and briefed them using the TEST method and informed them that we would land normally and that they could expect a normal taxi to the gate. We followed the QRH and selected flaps 15 using the ALTN system, and landed normally. We informed ATC on the ground that we did not require further assistance, but a truck followed us to the gate per their protocol.At the gate we met with maintenance personnel and spoke with the Chief Pilot.We both felt comfortable and able to continue with our scheduled flying, so we did.				737-700 Captain reported a trailing edge flap problem resulted in a go around to perform the QRH procedures. The flight crew then requested priority handling and continued the approach at destination airport.

Investigated as a crew using available resources in flight deck, which was limited to information from my [application] to include AOM, ASM , MEL,  Aircraft Maintenance Logbook and QRH as to why this light was on. Captain coordinated to dispatch and Maintenance using flight phone and ACARS messages to further investigate. In that time we sent a code to Maintenance associated with the Spar Valve Light being in disagreement. It was determined through Technical Support that an engine wash had been performed the night before and to check breakers for spar valves. After examining the Circuit Breaker panel very closely it was determined that the breakers were left in the out position. Being that everything was working normally we left breakers out and inquired Maintenance who confirmed that we were in-fact safe to continue. Continued flight to destination. At the gate in ZZZ1, I was greeted with a random drug test so I didn't witness any interactions with Maintenance in ZZZ1 related to the write up but I did see Maintenance at the gate as I was being escorted to my drug test. Lack or non-requirement of Aircraft Maintenance Logbook. The engine wash was not logged and the breakers pulled where also not noted. We had no way of knowing what had gone on the night before. Had there been an entry in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook for us to review as well as a bright collar placed on what I would consider a very important system breaker we would have easily trapped this error. It was very difficult to make out that the breakers where out because the white was very dirty, even after examining the panels closely. I have attached an actual picture as observed during the event.		Flying a routine trip from ZZZ2-ZZZ1. Got to the airplane and I did the walk around and started the interior inspection. It turns out that I missed 2 Circuit Breakers that were out behind the First Officer (FO) headrest close to the wall. Everything was normal through taxi, takeoff, climb. We reached cruise altitude, and I noticed 2 blue lights on the overhead panel. Both SPAR VALVE CLOSED lights were on. At first, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. That's not possible I said to my FO. We started researching the QRH, AOM and the ASM. We found nothing, so I reached out to Maintenance through dispatch. They told us they would research and get back to us. ACARS message said an engine wash was done in ZZZ2 and to check the P6-3 panel. We did and found the 2 breakers out. I was immediately mad at myself for missing them on preflight. We could not understand how the engines started in the first place. Technical Support also said this wouldn't cause any issues, we continued on the ZZZ1 and landed uneventfully. Obviously, should have noticed the 2 breakers. They were probably the hardest to see from my seat. Also, after engine start, we did not see the blue lights on. It was a bright sunshine day and they don't stand out like red or amber. But, still should have seen them. I couldn't believe that it was not annotated in the log book that Circuit Breakers had been pulled. That would have caused a definite double check of the Circuit Breaker panel. Just like putting a write-up in that gear pins were installed for a tire change. Also, it would have been nice if these blue lights turned on the master caution. And, the white part of the Circuit Breaker was not really bright white so that it stood out. It was more of a faded off-white. Even when we knew to look there, it took a second to realize they were in fact out.		B737-800 flight crew reported missing two circuit breakers that were pulled for a compressor wash during maintenance that were not noticed until cruise. The flight crew reset the circuit breakers and continued the flight to destination airport.

We were descending in Vertical Speed mode to try and get down. We intercepted the localizer and the F/O (First Officer) said setting zeros. I did not look to ensure we had intercepted the glideslope. It wasn't until the F/O called for Flaps 30 that I looked and noticed that we had indeed not intercepted the glideslope and descended below it, still in Vertical Speed mode. I immediately took the aircraft disconnected the autopilot and leveled us at around a thousand feet and gave the aircraft back to the F/O. It was at that time, Approach gave us a Low Altitude Alert and asked if we had the field. I responded with a yes. They then cleared us for the visual, so the F/O and I maintained altitude until recapturing the glideslope and continued without incident.Better Pilot Monitoring. Also I think the setting zeros after glideslope intercept should be examined as a Company procedure. Had we still had 1,600 ft. set in the window, the aircraft would have captured that instead.		ATC held us high for traffic well past our descent point. Final vectors were tight to the final approach fix. We were cleared maintain 1,600 ft. until established, cleared ILS Runway XX. F/O (First Officer) was high approaching FAF, while configuring, set a vertical speed to catch the glideslope. As F/O intercepted the LOC course we continued to descend under the glideslope at a rate that would not allow the glideslope to be captured. During this time F/O finalized configuration for landing and called VOR/LOC captured and stated setting 0's. Aircraft had not captured glide slope and continued to descend. At approximately 1,100 ft., Captain announced, 'We are low.' Automation was disabled and aircraft leveled at 1,000 ft. to 1,100 ft. During this time ATC called out a low altitude alert, which was acknowledged. We were subsequently cleared the visual and maintained 1,000 ft. until glideslope intercept. After glideslope intercept landing was accomplished without further incident.F/O could have configured earlier in order to slow things down and not be task saturated during the approach course intercept. F/O could have been more diligent on validating the FMAs (Flight Mode Annunciators) to ensure they are what is expected. Leaving FAF altitude in the MCP (Mode Control Panel) window would have prevented descent before glideslope capture. PM (Pilot Monitoring) could have warned earlier and validated FMAs.		Air carrier flight crew reported an altitude deviation and terrain warning from ATC while on final approach. Automation dependency, distractions, and possible non-SOP's were to blame. Corrections were made and a visual landing accomplished.

The autopilot automatically disconnected and the aircraft was hand flown to recovery. We were unable to maintain altitude and an approximate 1000' descent without clearance was needed to recover back to normal airspeed. The event lasted approximately one minute. We had been using the weather radar throughout departure and climbout and there were zero radar returns in the area at the time of the event. No injuries or damage was noted and we continued on to our destination ZZZ1.		Severe weather in area, reroute departure for weather. Leveling off at FL 350, still IMC, broke out just in time to see a large cell (that was NOT painting on weather radar).

This is just above stall speed and surprised me. Recommend Training Department highlight this and emphasize this during systems courses. VNav speed logic could easily bring the speed to 240 or 250, instead of 230, allowing a higher stall margin at cruise altitudes.

A go around was initiated to assess the aircraft and situation. [We advised ATC] while complying with assigned vectors to hold. While CA (Captain) completed the QRH LE FLAP TRANSIT checklist, the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree checklist was accidentally selected via the hyperlink present on the screen. This resulted in an approach and landing being completed in a flaps up configuration with speeds of Vref 40+55 kts. The aircraft should have been configured for landing at flaps 15 and Vref 15+15 kts. The aircraft successfully landed and taxied free of the runway.Following the go around to assess the aircraft and situation, ATC issued several instructions regarding altitude, airspeed, heading, and holding instructions which distracted and slowed completing the QRH checklist. Crew had to remind ATC that they were a [priority] aircraft when prepared for the approach.[Request priority handling] earlier in the situation to prevent task saturation compounded by ATC.		B737-800 flight crew reported Leading Edge device malfunction on approach and used incorrect checklist to address problem.

Both pilot's front panel 'CABIN ALTITUDE' red lights illuminated as well as the 'CABIN ALT' warning horn sounding.   Both pilots donned O2 masks and established communications, and I silenced the horn. FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying).  I grabbed the QRC card. We both agreed that the cabin altitude was indicating about 10,000-10,500 ft. and I had the correct checklist item in hand. Step #4 selecting the cabin outflow valve to full close in manual regained pressurization control. Informed ATC we were dealing with a pressurization problem and needed lower now. ATC assigned 10,000 ft. Since I had control of the cabin controller in manual and we were already descending, I did not declare an emergency. Followed the QRH procedure for controlling the cabin in manual till landing.  There were no casual factors involved with this event.I have no suggestions for this event. The pressurization was working normal from takeoff., cruise and the initial descent. Seems like we may have had a failure of both a primary and secondary auto controller at the same time. That's why we didn't get any alerts or warnings till the cabin altitude reached 10,000 ft. Initial check at the TOD showed the auto controller was set correctly for a landing at ZZZ.				B737-800 flight crew reported pressurization malfunction during descent.

All stated it smelled very musty and possibly like dirty socks. They said it smelled exactly like the jar samples they had in training. No fume procedures were executed due to the fact that when I was notified, I was pulling into the Gate Area, and I immediately shut the engines down. Smell dissipated quickly after engine shutdown. APU was off at time of fume event, and flight attendants stated they started to smell it below 10000 ft. after I rang them with the no smoking seat belt chime.

As we neared some areas of concern on the arrival I called them to verify that everyone was seated in case we encountered turbulence. This conversation occurred somewhere around 10,000 feet, and during the conversations Name, the F1 mentioned that they had smelled a dirty sock odor during the descent. We continued the arrival and approach into ZZZ, accomplished an uneventful landing, and upon taxiing in discussed the issue further. The flight attendants stated that they had smelled a dirty sock odor from about 10,000 feet until gear down on the approach. We contacted Maintenance and made the appropriate write up and completed the Odor Event Form.				A320 Captain reported the Lead Flight Attendant reported a 'dirty socks' odor during descent.

We then received a call from the A-Flight Attendant who said there was smoke in the cabin. We leveled off at 14,000 ft and [requested priority handling] with Center and received vectors back to ZZZ. I asked the First Officer to run the Smoke, Fire or Fumes Non-normal checklist while I flew the aircraft, talked to ATC and text messaged Dispatch through ACARS. After we turned off the galley power switches, the smoke seemed to dissipate. I asked ATC to have the Fire Department standing by upon arrival. While being vectored for the ILS to Runway XXR I checked in with the Flight Attendants to verify that the smoke was dissipating in the cabin and they assured me it was. We landed uneventfully. After landing I checked with the Flight Attendants again and asked if they saw any reason to evacuate, they said no, the smoke was almost gone. We decided to taxi to the gate where we deplaned and called Dispatch and Maintenance. We were unable to determine the source of the smoke.		After climbing through 10,000 ft, best guess around 12,000 ft to 13,000 ft both the Captain and I simultaneously sensed a burning smell. It seemed like the Flight Attendants in the cabin sensed the burning smell at the same time that the Captain I did. We stopped our climb, [requested priority handling], and asked ATC for vectors back to ZZZ. We ran the checklist for Fire Smoke and Fumes in the cockpit and then the Smoke Fumes Evacuation Checklist. We handled the aircraft and checklist efficiently and got the aircraft set up for vectors to the ILS [Runway] XXR at ZZZ. We were in communication with the Flight Attendants and the Passengers to come back to ZZZ. We had Fire and Rescue trucks waiting for us at the arrival end of XXR. After landing the aircraft, we determined it was safe to taxi to the gate and further assess the situation there. We got to the gate and then de-planed the passengers with no further event.		B737-800 flight crew reported a burning odor during departure climb that was followed shortly by the A Flight Attendant's report of smoke in the passenger cabin. Flight crew requested and was granted priority handling for an airborne return which concluded in a safe landing and taxi to the gate. Maintenance provided at gate.

CA's (PM) FD (Flight Director) pitch bar did not work from the beginning of climbout (simply was not there most of the time). Everything on FO's side seemed to be working normally and FO was PF (Pilot Flying). Also for about 95% of the flight the CA's speed tape had a 'SPD LIM' amber flag in the top left corner of the MFD (Multi-Function Flight Display). The CA's airspeed indicator closely matched the FO's and standby's airspeed the entire flight. During climbout we ran the Airspeed Unreadable checklist because we had SPD LIM failure flag on CA's side. We opted to not run the immediate action items because we determined that all airspeed indications on FO and standby were reliable and CA's airspeed exactly matched FO's side and the autopilot and autothrottles and FMS were all working normally.At roughly FL335 the stick shaker went off only on the captain's control column for 1-2 seconds. This was an erroneous warning. The CA's red barber pole would fill the entire visible airspeed range shown on the MFD momentarily while the stick shaker on CA's side (this is what happens every time we had the stick shaker on CA's side activate). The instruments on the FO side worked normally at this time and for the entire flight. We asked for a level off at FL350 (we had been cleared to FL370 at a final altitude). We slowed to Mach.74 to give us more buffer between both stall and overspeed. We then asked for a decent to FL330 to give us even more buffer. The sticker shaker went off for 1-2 seconds roughly 6 times during our cruise phase. FO continued to be PF and we decided to keep the autopilot and auto throttles engaged while CA tried to communicate with company but that did not work. ATC tried several VHF and HF frequencies to help us talk to M/C (Maintenance Control). I was thinking we had plenty of gas and there was a small chance M/C could help me fix the problem. After finally communicating with M/C after a few minutes of trying to reach them with static and bad connections we had no way to fix the problem in the air so we requested priority handling and decided to return to ZZZ. Our only really concern was getting a stick shaker during the decent and approach but neither happened and the decent approach seemed perfectly normal other than CA's FD pitch bar was missing most of the decent and SPD LIM warning flag was there most of the time on only the CA's side.Prior to decent we had a master caution during recall that indicated we also had an Auto Slat Fail. We ran the checklist and determined it was a single stall management/yaw damper computer that had failed. The decent and approach was uneventful other than CA's FD pitch bar was missing most of the decent and SPD LIM warning flag was there most of the time on only the CA's side. FO was the PF and we had vectors to a 10 mile final. We landed at normal landing weight with plenty of fuel to spare. Fire crash and rescue was ready but we did not need assistance. Overall, the plane flew completely normal and this was almost a non event. We never came even close to stalling or overspending. Every stick shaker activation was erroneous. The problem was that the stick shaker activating randomly on the CA control column was a nuisance and we decided the safer, more conservative, choice was to return to ZZZ1 which is a familiar field with no mountains and Company Maintenance. I was concerned that if the problem degraded or we experienced another malfunction we would be putting ourselves in a more difficult situation so I decided that returning to ZZZ1 was the appropriate action. We wrote an ELB reports for the appropriate discrepancies. We went to a new airplane in ZZZ1 and got our passengers to ZZZ2 3 hours and 50 minutes late.		On Takeoff as the pilot flying we departed using gusty takeoff procedures. On climb out due to busy ATC instructions and the work load of both pilots I put the autopilot on early at around 5,000-6,000 feet. Unknown to me the Captain then informed me that his flight director was not functioning correctly by not showing the horizontal bar. The FO's side flight director was functioning correctly. We continued our climb out at this point as there were no other adverse indications. We also noticed above the CA's speed tape, a SPD LIM amber flag appeared above the speed awareness tape on the left corner of the PFD (Primary Flight Display). At this point the CA started to trouble shoot the problem while I took the radios and continued flying. We noted that the FO's PFD and airspeed indications were functioning correctly and also the CA's airspeed matched the FO's. We discussed returning to ZZZ at this point also, but the CA, after running the appropriate checklist wanted to check with Maintenance Control to determine if there was a fix that he was not seeing before diverting back to ZZZ. Passing through FL335 the stick shaker went off on the CA's control column for a couple of seconds. The FO's side did not get the shaker. Were then asked ATC to descend back down to FL330. It was noted again that the airspeed on both sides was exactly the same through that event and the only reason the shaker went off on the CA's side was because of erroneous speed awareness tape with the red barber pole filling the entire airspeed range on the PFD momentarily, leading to the shaker. We again both noted that the actual airspeed on both sides was the same and the FO's side was completely normal and therefore, although distracting, a completely erroneous stick shaker.  However, at this point, we made the decision to divert back to ZZZ. The stick shaker went off erroneously maybe 5-6 times on the CA's side during this time. The CA during this time was also trying to get a hold of M/C but without effective communications. We then turned back towards ZZZ and request priority. We asked to be cleared direct to ZZZ and to set up for about a 15 mile final for Runway XR. The rest of the flight was uneventful. After swapping aircraft we continued onto Honduras a few hours later.		B737 flight crew reported a SPD LIM flap on The Captain's PFD in flight. The stick shaker on the Captain's control yoke began to activate repeatedly for 1 to 2 seconds at a time. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

Flight crew accomplished ECAM and followed up with QRG checklist. Overheat extinguished 10 minutes later. Flight Crew and Dispatch communicated during the flight and agreed the use of Priority Authority was not necessary at the time due to the expectation that full hydraulic power would be restored prior to approach and landing. Dispatcher made contact with ATC to advise of our maintenance issue. When we checked in with Approach Control, the controller assigned priority handling on behalf of the flight crew. Per the checklist, the Green Hyd Pump was selected on prior to commencing the approach, with no further overheat issues. Approach, landing and taxi into gate were uneventful under ships power. Reviewing the aircraft log history shows numerous Green Hydraulic overheats occurring to this aircraft in the last 4 days.		Approximately 1.5 hours into our flight at cruise HYD G pump overheat appeared on ECAM. Captain flew the aircraft and I as first officer ran the ECAM and then the subsequent checklist. After about 10 minutes the pump returned to normal operating temperature and the crew decided to continue flight.  Within 15 minutes of landing, unprompted, approach queried flight crew about the status of the hydraulic system. Captain explained the situation in addition to expressing that a normal approach and landing was anticipated. Approach then stated that they would be assigning priority handling on crews behalf. G Pump was turned on per checklist during approach phase and the flight had an uneventful approach and landing followed my an uneventful taxi in to gate.		A320 flight crew reported a Green Hydraulic System Overheat message at cruise. The flight crew performed the QRH procedures and continued to the destination airport.

We actually had 2 events, the first of which was on takeoff, and the second started during the descent to landing in ZZZ1.The first odor issue was brought to my attention after signaling that we were above ten thousand ft. The Purser called to tell me that they had an odor in the back that smelled sort of like burning plastic but they weren't really sure. I had the flight attendants seated at the time due to turbulence and weather on departure. Since we had cleared the weather and had only light turbulence at the time, I had the flight attendants get up and investigate to see if they could find the source being mindful to also carefully check to see if there were any hotspots in areas they thought the smell might be coming from. They reported back a few minutes later that there was no smoke or hotspots and that the odor seemed to be dissipating. We lowered the temperature in the cabin and set the pack flow to HI and by the time we reached cruise the smell was mostly gone and continued to go away. No crew or passengers reported feeling ill at that time, and while the odor was noticeable at first it did not seem over-powering or dangerous, so with conditions improving and no way to know what the smell was, we elected to continue towards the destination knowing that better weather and suitable alternates were ahead of us should they be needed. The odor was gone at cruise and did not return until we were in our descent for landing.After we started our descent, the odor returned when the power was brought back to idle. It was first noticed in the cockpit as the same smell from before and then a few minutes later the flight attendants said they could smell it near row 26. The more we descended, it seemed the odor increased. We were close to ZZZ1 at that point so we continued toward the airport and landed with no issues. As we taxied to the gate, I stated to the First Officer that the smell was starting to cause my throat and tongue to feel irritated and I felt like I might be getting light-headed. It was at that time that the First Officer told me that he was also starting the feel sick. By the time we finished that conversation, we were pulling into the gate. After parking, we shut down the engines and opened the cockpit windows and door after completing our checklists. I checked in with the Flight Attendants to see how they were doing. They informed me, that they also were feeling tingling in their throats as well and one said she was light-headed. I inquired if any passengers reported feeling ill and wanted to be seen by paramedics and I was told there were none.I notified Maintenance Control of the issue and told them I was writing up the plane for the odor/fume issue as we deplaned. I got all of the crew off of the airplane and I then contacted the Operations Manager, who was great and very helpful. He advised me to call Medlink which was my next call where I obtained the phone number for Employees which I provided to all the other crewmembers. I had them individually call and get evaluated on the phone by Medlink.  I was advised that based on my condition that unless I did not continue to improve, I did not need to see a medical professional. All 4 of the other crewmembers were advised to be seen by paramedics which they did.  I continued to monitor how my crew was doing and provided them all with my personal phone number and email, spoke again with the Operations Manager, filled out the Airbus Smoke/Fume/Odor form for maintenance, and interacted with ZZZ1 Operations.I believe that there are some insidious things that occurred during this event that pilots and flight attendants should be aware of. We have odor events all the time on our aircraft and 99.99% of the time they go away with no issues and we continue on.  We become biased to believe it is no big deal, andgenerally the first thought isn't to get out the Smoke/Fumes/Odor Checklist. Many believe they must have burned something in the oven or the airplane was de-iced and it's a residual smell or something like that. We don't usually think about how the longer-term breathing of an odor or fume will affect us even if the smell is tolerable because we may be pre-occupied with flying the aircraft around weather or preparing to land. We are always taught to fly the airplane first so it's possible that we might not react as quickly as we would like. We sometimes don't share how we are doing with our fellow crewmembers; I wish I had known my First Officer was starting to feel sick in the air. I was flying and concentrating on landing and should have asked him how he was doing, but I did not. I have a very sensitive sense of smell, so I thought the strong odor was more me than anything; We need to remember that in the future should something like this occur again, we need to open up a conversation much sooner and ask about how each person is feeling. We as pilots need to bring the Flight Attendants more into the conversation. While I pride myself on communicating with our Flight Attendants, there is always room for improvement. While I was getting feedback from them on how things were going in the cabin, I probably could have asked more and better questions to include asking how they were feeling. I didn't know until after we deplaned that at least one flight attendant felt light-headed.				A320 Captain reported a 'burning plastic' odor during descent which resulted in the entire flight crew experiencing physiological symptoms. After a safe landing, maintenance requested and flight crew was referred for medical evaluation.

The plane came in the night before, and this write up was cleared. It was the first flight of the day for this airplane. On taxi out, all systems operated normally. We had a delay on the ground for flow into ZZZ. So we had about a 25 minute taxi. Everything was operating normally until we leveled off at FL360, about 30 minutes after takeoff. Shortly after that, we got a ding. Looked over and saw Hydraulic: G RSVR OVHT ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor). Captain divided task by having me fly and do the radios, and he will deal with the ECAM. The ECAM directed us to turn off the PTU (Power Transfer Unit) and Green Hydraulic Pump. We verified each switch before selecting it off. We went over they system pages, and talked about what systems were lost. The CA then went into the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). The QRH had a statement to restore the lost system once it was no longer overheated. Also the QRH noted that we could have a 10% higher burn due to spoiler float. We took the burn to destination then added 10% subtracted that from our FOB. We felt we would still land in ZZZ with plenty of gas. Then the CA notified dispatch, and got a frequency to talk to Maintenance Control. We all agreed that continuing to ZZZ was the best course of action. After about 6 minutes, I noticed the fault had cleared. Since the Green system has landing great extension, nose wheel steering, normal breaking, thrust reverser 1, and 2 spoilers on it, we felt trying to restore the system closer to the airport was the safest option. We were concerned if we restored the system too early, it would overheat again on approach. We advised center of our situation, and requested priority handling.With a little less than an hour left, we started briefing. We started talking about all the threats we would have if the system was not restored. We talked about gravity extension, longer landing distance, not being able to steer off the runway. We talked about if we had to go around, we would not be able to retract our gear. That meant higher fuel burn coming back to land. We decided on downwind trying to restore the green system would be the best place, because if it did not restore we would have plenty of time to notify ATC we will be needing a tug and perform the gravity gear extension procedure. We decided to Configure early if the system restored In case it would over heat again. Talked about if the system over headed again on final approach after configuring, what we would do. We had two jump seaters, and we asked them if they had any other suggestions or they agreed with our plan of action. They agreed with our plan, and provided some concerns to keep in mind. We told ATC we will need XXL for landing, because it was the longest runway. Told ATC we will need ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) standing by, and notified them of potentially needing to be towed off the runway. After we were done briefing, the CA took over flying the airplane. When abeam the field, we were able to restore the Green system. Made a normal approach and landing. We are able to taxi off the runway and to the gate on our own power. Maintenance met us at the gate, and we told them of the issues. They informed us that this has been a reoccurring issue over the past several days. Great teamwork, workload management, and communication lead this event to be a successful outcome.		Shortly after reaching cruise altitude, we received an ECAM for a Green Hydraulic System Reservoir Overheat. We referenced the overhead panel and confirmed the associated fault light illuminated. After passing Flying Pilot duties to the first officer, I initiated the steps associated ECAM. Simply stated, the Green Hydraulic System was isolated (PTU Off) and secured (Engine Pump Off). The Fault light remained illuminated, and the Overheat Indication was noted. The two remaining hydraulic systems (Blue and Yellow) sustained all hydraulic needs at cruise flight. Our next step was to complete the QRH and calculate the associated Non-Normal Performance Landing Distance. Both tasks were accomplished. The First Officer and I had a quick discussion regarding our options on this short flight. After building a game plan, I queried Dispatch to Call Me and asked them to bring Maintenance Control on the line. We discussed the Hydraulic non normal and the associated re-occurring maintenance history that had been reviewed with the Flight Plan and Maintenance Release in ZZZ1. We advised that the Fault light had extinguished (approximately 6 minutes) and the hydraulic reservoir temperature had cooled to the point the system was no longer exceeding temperature limits. Noting this condition, the First Officer, Maintenance Control and I all agreed that the QRH procedure for attempting to restore Green Hydraulic power prior to arrival would be an option. Dispatch was then engaged regarding our flight and continuing to ZZZ. While this was my preference, I included the dispatcher in the conversation and confirmed they had no objection to this course of action. At this point the call concluded and we agree to stay in communication via ACARS.An ELB entry was made to document the non-normal and support Maintenance Control's phone call to ZZZ Maintenance advising them of our inbound aircraft and situation. At this point the approach briefing was conducted. The briefing outlined our plan to attempt green system restoration in the terminal area and continue with green system pressure for a normal landing. Alternatively, we brief that if the system could not be restored, we would proceed with a manual gear extension, loss of spoilers 1/5 on landing, loss of normal breaking, nose wheel steering, #1 Thrust Reverser (etc...). The approach briefing was conducted, and we engaged our two jump seating Company pilots who were in the flight deck commuting home to ZZZ. Both offered their thoughts and suggestions to enhance our game plan. Additionally, the jump seating pilots switched seats to allow the jump seating pilot with previous Airbus experience to occupy the primary (center) jump seat. I handed the jump seater my QRH to back up the First Officer in the event additional checklists were required in the terminal area (I.E.: Manual Gear Extension). Lastly, we as a crew did a preliminary review of the manual gear extension procedure should hydraulic system restoration be unsuccessful.Our flight requested priority handling with ZZZ Center and advised them of our Hydraulic System condition, our desire to attempt restoration prior to landing, Fuel, SOB and Dangerous Goods. Additionally, we informed them we required Runway XXL for arrival and that we may or may not have nose wheel steering on arrival depending on the outcome of our system restoration attempt. An ACARS was sent to Dispatch advising of our request for priority handling. The Flight Attendants were apprised next with a test Briefing and advised of the situation and game plan. Lastly, I made an announcement to the passengers advising them of the situation and thanked them for flying with us. At this point I assumed the flying pilot duties again and the First Officer resumed pilot monitoring duties. ATC shortened our routing, removed all airspeed constraints and we initiated our descent for the ZZZ Airport. While on the downwind course at approximately 8,000 feet, we executed the QRH procedure to restore the Green System as the overheat condition was no longer present. Fortunately, the system restoration was successful and the green system was restored to 3,000 psi. The aircraft was configured normally and continued a normal landing without further hydraulic issues or overheat indications. The aircraft was met by ARFF on arrival and they proceeded to followed our aircraft to the gate. The aircraft taxied to the gate under it's own steering and power. After block in, the flight was debriefed with the First Officer and Jump seaters. After deplaning, I had a debrief conversation with our purser and thanked them for their assistance. Lastly, Company maintenance boarded the aircraft for a debrief of the hydraulic reservoir overheat and system restoration.		A320 flight crew reported a Green Hydraulic System Reservoir Overheat light illuminated in flight. The flight crew performed the QRH procedures and secured the Green system Pump. The flight crew requested priority handling and reactivated the Green System Pump closer to the destination airport to conduct a precautionary landing.

This Checklist focused on Fire for Electric or Bleed Air, with NO sight, smell, odor checklist ended step 14. CA restarted same checklist and selected Toxic substance which led to new Checklist. However, decision tree led to Toxic Gas, Not in Cabin, which led to notify FAs and then Dispatch and finally Maint. CA concerns were Toxic Gas thru FD deck door grill to FA 1 (Flight Attendant) and guidance on Halon removal time for Flt Deck. The Bottle gage needle stopped below Green Zone and then held w/ no sensation or coolness. Maint said no guidance existed for Flt Deck Air quality after Halon discharge. Best guess was 15 mins (PBE Limits?). Crew waited 20 mins removed O2 masks and noted no symptoms and continued. Fire Bottle Gage location can increase bumping bags or bodies into it. NO guidance at [company] on toxicity of Halon nor training. Crew was expecting some visible indication. Halon Fire Bottle usage only mentioned in QRH under Lithium Ion Battery Overheat. No info available in FOM on Halon Discharge, only HAZMAT. Crew was lucky Entire Fire Ext Bottle did not discharge. Maintenance Techs discharged remaining contents of bottle outside - crew only noticed slight fog from gas pressure release, but no color, odor or sensation. Better information and training on Halon toxicity and usage on the Flight Deck vs Cabin. Would Noise Cancelling headsets block the hissing sound of Halon discharge? I use Telex 850 passive headset and heard this sound. Recent QRH update mentions rewording of Fire Extinguisher contents...				B737-800 Captain reported a fume event during cruise caused by a leak of a cockpit fire bottle. After completing appropriate QRH procedures flight continued to destination and executed a safe landing.

To me it sounded like an O2 mask or line broke and then was slowly leaking. We looked around the for the source and the Captain discovered it was the Halon Fire Extinguisher by feeling air from the pressure gauge. After a moments pause of realizing what happened, the Captain directed us to put on our O2 masks and establish communication. Once we completed that, the Captain transferred the controls to me and started looking for the correct QRH procedure. There were no direct correlation procedures for our situation and so we choose to start at Smoke and Fumes checklist as it was the highest level of danger we could start with. The Captain did a great job of keeping the situation calm and at the right level of urgency. He contacted [Operations] and was then connected to [Maintenance Control] as well. [Maintenance Control] did not have any direct guidance available for our given situation. Next the Captain ran the Toxic Substance check list. This did not really apply because it was directed more towards a cabin problem. During the whole situation, the Captain asked how I was feeling and if I felt any effects of possible halon inhalation. I never felt any ill effects. [Maintenance Control] was unable to give us any good information on how long the Halon would last in the flight deck due to no procedures for this event. After about 20 minutes we felt it was safe to remove our O2 masks and continue to ZZZ. We made that decision based on not seeing any evidence of Halon discharge (we later discovered we were both mistaken on what that would look like), the discharge from the fire bottle seemed to have stopped (no sounds, no felt air coming from the previous spot and bottle pressure holding steady for the last 15 minutes), and after some additional information from [Maintenance Control], we felt the air had sufficiently circulated through the flight deck. We both kept our O2 mask at hand and ready to don again if the bottle where to release again.The location of the fire extinguisher lends itself in inadvertent contact as crew and team members transit the flight deck. Meaning, as people get out of the left seat, they can be making contact with the bottle without noticing or as a way to stabilize them themselves if they lose balance getting out of the seat or the jumpseat. Over time it is conceivable that the gauge could lose structural integrity to the point of not being able to hold the correct pressure any longer. Suggestions to Prevent: none that I can think of now. It would have been helpful to have known what to expect when the bottle is discharged (i.e. powder versus clear gas, odor, effects, timing of effects.) A quick brief on what Halon looks like, how it effects the body and perhaps a review on if a QRH procedure might be needed might be a few ways to mitigate problems if this were to happen again.				B737-800 First Officer reported the fire extinguisher in the flight deck began leaking during cruise. The flight crew donned oxygen masks until the leaking stopped, and then continued to the destination airport.

FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying), I was PM (Pilot Monitoring). Encountered moderate turbulence climbing through approximately FL 190. I called FA (Flight Attendants) to have them remain seated for a while longer. I observed that we now in icing conditions (had entered cloud with OAT of 5 Degrees C.), so I turned on Engine Anti Ice. Approximately 15 seconds later while climbing through FL 220, #1 Engine had substantial loss of thrust with loud noise and vibration. Aircraft yawed sharply left. FO was still hand flying at this point. He immediately announced 'My Aircraft', applied right rudder & aileron while reducing aircraft pitch attitude to maintain airspeed. I instructed him to level off and regain control of aircraft. Notified ATC that we wanted to stop the climb and descend back to FL 210. Then turned attention back to #1 Engine. Was producing about 35-40% N1 while still making noise and vibrating. FO disconnected Auto throttles and retarded #1 thrust lever to idle. Noise and vibration stopped with engine still running at flight idle. #1 FA called to ask if we had heard the noise. I told him that we had an engine problem, that the aircraft was under control, and that I would get back to them as soon as I could. I [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors back to ZZZ. ATC began vectors with an initial right hand turn to the southwest, followed by a turn to the west. I told controller we would need a decent sized box pattern back to ZZZ to accomplish checklists. Received ATC clearance back to ZZZ via radar vectors. FO suggested descent to exit icing conditions. I made the request with ATC and we descended back into clear air at 17,000 feet, where FO trimmed the aircraft for single-engine cruise. I suggested an attempt to see if the engine would now produce any more power. As the FO began to advance the #1 thrust lever, the noise and vibration returned without any increase in thrust. After discussing the situation with the FO, I made the decision to secure the engine. I used the QRH to accomplish engine severe damage or separation, one engine inoperative landing, and non-routine landing Checklists. This included briefing the flight attendants for a precautionary landing, making 2 PAs to the passengers, and notifying Dispatch via the Crew Phone. Received radar vectors for ILS to Runway XX in VMC. Confirmed with ATC that ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) would be standing by.FO was still PF while I also made all necessary modifications to the FMC, including route change and setting up for the approach. Completed normal Descent checklist and Before Landing checklist to the line. Once established on final approach, I assumed control of the aircraft and became the PF to accomplish the landing. I made this decision because I had much more experience in the 737 (new CA with just 130 hours but flew it for 2 years an FO with about 1400 hours). The new hire FO had just recently completed his OE and had just over 40 hours in the 737. We had identified the low-time status for each of us as a threat in our earlier briefing at the gate. Configured for single-engine landing and completed Before Landing checklist. Performed single-engine landing on Runway XX at ZZZ. Stopped aircraft on the runway at approximately the mid-field position (near taxiway F). Made a quick PA instructing passengers to remain seated as Safety vehicles completed an inspection. ATC assigned discreet frequency for us to communicate with ARFF Commander. Had ARFF conduct visual inspection of the aircraft. Received the 'all clear' and then taxied to gate with ARFF following us. Upon arriving at gate, made a final PA to passengers advising them that the aircraft would be going out of service and to take all belongings as they exited, and that a gate agent would have more information concerning the flight as a new plan was put together. Gate agent came on board and informed me thatthey had a new aircraft and gate. I informed passengers of the new gate with a final PA. Made an AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) entry for the engine failure and discussed with Maintenance Supervisor, who had also come on board. I want to commend the performance of the New Hire FO. He did an outstanding job of maintaining aircraft control and communicating with ATC when I was otherwise busy talking to other involved parties. While new to airline with just over 40 hours in the 737, his previous experience as a different make/model pilot proved invaluable. I think we worked together very well by implementing the company strategy and communicating effectively. It proves that 2 pilots who were flying just our 2nd leg together can 'gel' and successfully work through a serious situation.				B737 Captain reported loss of thrust and engine vibration after selecting Engine Anti Ice to on. The Flight Crew performed an inflight shut down of the affected engine and made an air turn back and precautionary landing at destination airport.

Our aircraft suddenly and violently banked left and then immediately right approximately 35-45 degrees both ways. After overcoming the startle effect I grabbed the yoke and disconnected the autopilot and stabilized the aircraft. The PLIs ('angry eyebrows') had dropped to just a few degrees above the flight director so I reached for the throttles but didn't disengage them because we were now stable and slightly climbing again. While this was happening I noticed on TCAS (160nm range) an aircraft near us that was at our altitude and descending while crossing in front of us. Once level, we called IAH Center and told them what happened. We then checked with the Flight Attendants who had just taken out the carts - one was rammed by a cart in the galley which doused her with hot coffee, another had neck pain from falling and a cart fell on the third Flight Attendant. I asked them if they were badly injured. They said no. I asked if they wanted to land in order to receive medical attention and they said no again so we decided to continue to [destination]. A PA was then made to the passengers explaining what we believed had happened. No passengers were hurt. After our adrenaline levels returned to normal levels we spoke to the Flight Attendants one more time explaining what happened and asked if they were ok to continue. They were good. This event started and ended in seconds. Let me repeat. This event started and ended in seconds. It happened so fast that we didn't even have time to call out 'upset' even though it was an upset situation. We were not in a stall condition but it was damn close. My new hire First Officer performed admirably during and after the event.	Reporter stated he had nothing further to add to his narrative.	In our climb, within 1000 ft. of our cruising altitude of FL360, we encountered wake turbulence from an Airbus that was descending from right to left. Encountering their wake turbulence our aircraft abruptly rolled to the left between 30 to 40deg followed by an immediate un-commanded roll back to the right of about 40 to 45deg bank. While the indications were that we were approaching an upset condition the Captain proactively disabled the autopilot and stabilized the aircraft returning it to a steady state. I asked for the Flight Attendants to check in to find out if there were any injuries. One flight attendant had a cart roll into her and pressed her up against the door while spilling hot coffee on her. The other flight attendant was trying to control the cart hurt his neck. We contacted ATC and informed them of the incident. We contacted Dispatch to notify them of our encounter. There were no immediate injuries to the crew or passengers. We did not receive a TA or RA event, so the aircraft was outside the threat zone.		B737-700 flight crew reported an upset occurred when they encountered wake turbulence climbing through FL350 in the vicinity of AUS.

I started the initial descent from 38,000 feet, shortly after starting the descent the Master Caution Light illuminated with the corresponding 'Auto Fail' Light illuminating on the pressurization panel. At that time I also noticed that the Cruise Altitude and Landing Altitude displays were blanked. I called out the abnormality and the Captain stated that it was 'Your Aircraft'. At that time I verified that I was in control of the aircraft 'My Aircraft' and continued the descent. Continuing the descent I also worked the radios while the captain proceeded to run the 'Auto Fail' light checklist in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). Initially it looked as though the captain was able to control the pressurization but around 22 thousand feet the captain directed me to put on my O2 mask. After donning the O2 masks and establishing crew communications the Captain told me to request priority handling and he then manually deployed the Passengers O2 masks. Once we were below 10,000 feet the Captain directed me to remove my O2 mask at that time we completed all normal checklists and landed safely.During the Auto Fail light checklist I noticed that the 'Auto Fail' light stayed illuminated and the 'ALT' and 'MAN' light never illuminated during the checklist. During the descent a slower rate of descent may have helped with controlling the pressurization of the Aircraft. After Landing maintenance informed us that the aircraft had previous pressurization issues with this aircraft. (9 write ups on Pressurization Problems was mentioned). I believe a slower rate of descent and smaller thrust reductions may have helped with manually controlling the pressurization after the initial pressurization failure. I also believe with multiple write ups on the pressurization system their may have been an issue that maintenance might not have caught.		Just after starting our descent into ZZZ from FL380, we got a Master Caution Light and 'AUTO FAIL' light on pressurization panel. No other lights on. Both cruise altitude window and landing altitude window had dashes '- - - -'.  Checked cabin altitude and deferential pressure, both ok at this time. Cabin vertical speed indicator began moving between 330 FPM down to near 1,000 FPM down.  Initiated 'Auto Fail' checklist on iPad QRH. When directed to go to manual control, manual light did not come on.  Was able to control cabin vertical speed between 300 FPM to 800 FPM with momentary switch movements open/close. FO was pilot flying so I gave him aircraft and radios while I worked the manual valve. Descending thru approximately FL220 cabin started to climb and cabin deferential started going down at steady but rapid rate. Looked like we were loosing control of the cabin. Directed FO to put on O2 masks and request priority handling.  I elected to manually deploy the cabin O2 before the cabin went above 10,000 feet. Initiated loss of cabin pressure checklist. Made a PA instructing the passengers to put on mask and follow crew member instructions. Called the Flight Attendants to let the know where we were at and notified the company thru ACARS. Did not complete emergency descent checklist as we were approaching 10,000 feet. Below 10,000 feet I made a PA. We were at a safe altitude and everyone could remove the O2 masks. Looking at the cabin altitude indicator showed basically our current altitude with differential pressure gauge at the upper limits. We could feel the pressure changes in our ears. At that point I check with the flight attendants to see if any was going to need medical assistance on the ground. They told my everyone was fine. Gave them my game plan for a normal landing and taxi to the gate. Let ATC know we were not going to need assistance on the ground and would land and taxi to the gate. After arriving at the gate and had deplaned, two passengers were complaining of ear pain and customer service people had called paramedics to have the checked out. 9 prior write-ups referencing pressurization problems. 2. Possible option- While in the descent ATC gave us the next crossing restriction. Thinking now the FO may have reduced the power more and the change in engine power may have cause the cabin to climb. With all the other erratic indications I didn't recognize this and called for the O2 masks. Recommend adding a caution note just after step 4 or 5 in the 'Auto Fail' checklist recommending manual throttles and small coordinated movements of the throttles while doing manual pressurization and to coordinate with ATC for an easy descent if able.		B737 flight crew reported loss of cabin pressure control during descent and the need for oxygen masks. The flight crew requested priority handling and made an immediate descent and landing at destination airport.

During startup we had an ELAC 1 fault which was cleared with ECAM. I was PF (Pilot Flying) and after takeoff, the aircraft had a heavy vibration and roll action. We continued the climb and cleaned up the aircraft. We had a FA (Flight Attendant) visually confirm that the left spoilers were deployed with the spoiler handle in the down and disarmed position. We continued to climb and the vibration mostly dissipated but was still evident. After confirmation with Maintenance Control and Dispatch on the Crew Phone, we elected to divert and land in ZZZ instead of continuing to destination ZZZ1. We burned down as much fuel as we could and set up for an approach. When we configured to flaps 2 the serious vibrations started again. We preformed a controllability check at pattern altitude and determined that the vibration was too great at flaps full so we used flaps 3 for landing. As we got closer to the Runway, the vibrations dissipated a bit and we made a normal landing overweight by 10,000 pounds into ZZZ. We had ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire) inspect the aircraft for damage, which there was none apparent and taxied to a gate and gave the aircraft to maintenance.  Our inspection of the aircraft at the gate found the right ground spoiler still extended. We are unsure if that was left over from the flight or just the landing roll. The only indications we received during the flight were the green spoiler arrows on ECAM. No other warnings or messages came up. We were and still are perplexed at how any spoilers could have been extended with the handle stowed. There could have been a secondary malfunction with the SEC 3 issue. It caught us totally by surprise. We followed the placard requirements of the SEC which were very basic. Would like to hear from Maintenance on what the cause was.				An A320 Pilot reported left hand spoilers deployed with the spoiler handle in the down position after take off. The flight Crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

We noticed the ENG 2 hydraulic pump LOW PRESSURE light illuminate. The Captain proceeded to perform the Quick Reference Handbook for a Hydraulic Pump LOW PRESSURE (B SYS). After some time, we noticed that the Hydraulic Pressure started to bleed pressure to zero and the ELEC 1 hydraulic pump LOW PRESSURE light illuminated. The Captain then proceeded to perform the loss of hydraulic system B Quick Reference Handbook. The Captain and I saw that hydraulic system A was still operating and was confident that we can make it back to ZZZ2 but also made contingency plans if it did fail enroute. We requested priority handling when we got on with ZZZ2 Center and safely landed in ZZZ2.Lessons learned was to continue to work as a crew and communication between flight crew is critical. The Captain and I went through multiple plans and discussed other possible errors and threats. Training proved to be of extreme help due to the scenarios we went through.				B737-700 First Officer reported loss of B Hydraulic System Fluid Quantity. The flight crew turned off the Hydraulic Pumps and requested priority handling.

The CA called for autopilot engagement. Immediately upon autopilot engagement the aircraft started tracking right of course. The Captain disengaged the autopilot and auto thrust so as to maintain directional control and airspeed as the aircraft seemed to be having difficulty with direction and speed. Tower handed us off to Departure and upon checking in with departure the vibration had dramatically worsened into what I would call more of a severe shake than a vibration so we [advised ATC] and requested a return to the field on the initial check in. Departure gave us vectors for a right hand pattern back to Runway XX. We were assigned an altitude of 5,000 ft. We made it to 5,000 ft. but we had difficulty maintaining altitude. The Captain kept control of the aircraft and had me cycle though the doors, wheels, and flight control pages to try and identify the problem. We found that the flight control page showed the left 3 outboard spoilers were deployed. The FA (Flight Attendant) called twice, first to tell us about the vibration in the back and the second time to tell us that 2 rows of O2 masks had dropped. The Captain made the decision to land flaps 3. We landed on Runway XX and the vibration continued until touchdown. Upon arrival at the gate we found that spoilers on the left had closed however there was a spoiler deployed on the right wing. There was an apparent issue with SEC 3 and it's control of the spoilers as SEC 3 was on an MEL due to the same issue on a previous flight. If there is an issue with a flight control maybe the aircraft should be out of service until the repair is made instead of the MEL.		High terrain environment. During the takeoff roll, the aircraft felt difficult (heavy) to rotate. I did not rotate forcefully. I picked the nose up and let the airplane fly off the ground. Vibration started with gear retraction and grew worse. Like nose wheel shimmy multiplied. Excessive and severe vibration was apparent and increasing in intensity. I called for the autopilot to limit distraction. The autopilot instantly rolled right. Autothrust was accelerating beyond SID speeds and the trend vector beyond 250 kts. I switched the autopilot off then switched autothrust off. I had the FO (First Officer) turn flight directors off and engage Track/FPA to help hold attitude. At this point we had been switched to Departure frequency and we checked on [advising ATC] and requesting return to the field. ATC provided vectors. Severe vibration was felt throughout the aircraft. FA's (Flight Attendants) called me shortly after takeoff about the vibration (we informed them we were aware) and then they called again on the downwind to tell me O2 masks had fallen in 2 rows (we informed them we returning for landing and would deal with that later). It was difficult to hold altitude and airspeed. Any turn resulted in a descent requiring power to recover. Any distraction pulling me away from the PFD caused a change in heading and altitude. VLS and V alpha prot were very high. I had the FO cycle through the Doors, Wheels, and F/CTL ECAM pages to find out what was causing the vibration. The F/CTL page indicated the left outboard 3 spoilers were deployed (un-commanded). The high VLS and V alpha prot plus the handling characteristics were consistent with having spoilers extended. (I checked the position of the spoiler handle - it was in the retracted position).We circled back to land on Runway XX. I stated to the FO that we would have to land flaps 3 due to the spoilers being extended and had the FO look for an airframe vibration QRH checklist. (After action review indicated that this checklist would not have helped.) The approach was difficult due to the high V alpha prot. I had to choose between slowing down or maintaining the descent profile to get flaps out. I had very little margin between Flap extension speed and VLS, and coincidentally VLS was maybe 2 kts. above V alpha prot. I considered overspeeding the flaps if necessary to slow down. It wasn't necessary, but just barely. We landed Flaps 3 intentionally; however, we did not select flaps 3. Time issue. The FO was task saturated. I used selected speed and manual thrust to landing.I made no PA's until after landing. I had my hands full and the FO was too new on the aircraft to turn over control. The FO did a good job and I was issuing very fast commands. He handled it well. SEC 3 was deferred per an MEL. We were unable to see the position of the number 1 and 2 spoilers on both wings. I read and complied with the 'O' procedures of the MEL. When we arrived at the gate after returning to the field we found the Right #1 spoiler full extended. I have been told that a passenger saw the spoiler extended prior to takeoff (this is here say and I have no proof if it's true or false). When and how that spoiler was extended is unknown to me. The deferral results in amber X's being displayed in that spoiler position on the ECAM page. In addition to that, we had 3 outboard spoilers deployed (un-commanded) on the left wing. This was the second event involving vibration and poor handling characteristics including the autopilot roll that I know of-- the first was clearly not as severe. Obviously, this was a serious problem with the spoilers and the aircraft should not have been in service. Aircraft should be removed from service if there is sufficient vibration to result in a loss of control. This aircraft had diverted once already because of this. We did not have enough information available to know what to expect. If we had been aware of what had occurred before, I would most likely have refused the airplane.		Air Carrier Captain and First Officer reported that 3 spoilers on the left outer wing deployed during rotation and climb. The pilot crew had difficulty in maintaining aircraft control and returned to the departure airport. The pilots reported a similar event had been recently reported and MEL'ed on this aircraft.

We had a smooth ride until that point. The severe turbulence occurred without warning, almost like hitting a wall. The encounter caused the autopilot, and we also believe the auto throttles, to come offline. Both my Captain and I took the controls and I pulled the power back, preventing the aircraft from over speeding. It momentarily went smooth then the turbulence hit again and was more sustained. My Captain called for control of the aircraft, which I relinquished. In addition to encountering rolling action, our altitude increased approximately 700 to 800 ft. above our assigned altitude. I informed ATC that we encountered turbulence and needed a lower altitude immediately. I informed ATC we had been unable to maintain altitude. ATC assigned us FL 290, which we descended to. There were no indications of any aircraft damage. I contacted the Flight Attendants. They said all Passengers were seated during the event and everyone in the back was ok and without injury. After the encounter, we did not experience anything worse than light chop.				B737 First Officer reported encountering severe turbulence and taking action to avoid an over speed condition.

Normally our aircraft would level without any input from me, but we were climbing at a high rate and approaching the aircraft right above us. To avoid a TCAS warning, I attempted to shallow the climb, but the Autopilot was already in capture mode. I reduced the thrust to about 50% to help reduce the climb rate, once we leveled and applied power we got multiple consecutive compressor stalls from the #1 engine. I immediately recognized the stalls and reduced power until it stopped compressor stalling. Several times I tried to add power, but got the same multiple consecutive compressor stalls. While at FL 280, only the #2 engine was used to keep us at cruise. After accessing, we determined to divert to ZZZ1 and [requested priority handling]. Once we got to a lower altitude, the #1 engine operated normally and was not shut down. We did the checklist, I informed the flight attendants and passengers of the situation. We did a normal approach with both engines and an overweight landing. There was no brake cooling issues and taxied to the gate.				B737-700 Captain reported at cruise altitude the #1 engine began multiple consecutive compressor stalls. Engine thrust was reduced, ATC gave the pilots priority handling, a diversion was commenced, and an overweight landing was accomplished.

I asked him for an update and he said they were changing the oil filter for the backup generator. He then tried to move the short ladder and realized it was wedged under the engine, and could not move it. The airplane was being fueled and the extra weight settled the engine on the ladder. The mechanic was upset and went for more help. I told the LCA (Line Check Airman), Student Captain and the other IRO about it and suggested they go look at the engine which they did. The other F/O also took a picture of the engine. We were told we would be delayed 90 minutes. So I went back down 30 minutes later for an update and saw 4 Mechanics total, one wearing a QC vest, working on changing the oil filter. They simply told me they would be done soon and that a bent line from the ladder was just an air line, and everything else was fine. There was no entry on the maintenance release pertaining to this issue, so we figured all was well, and departed. Shortly before we began our descent, we received an engine anti-ice L EICAS message. And there was ice forecast in the descent, so that had everyone's attention. Fortunately, we did not encounter any icing. We all discussed the possibility that it was not a coincidence for us to get that message after the mechanics had worked on that engine, so we decided to report it to Maintenance as soon as we got on the ground. The Mechanic was mildly alarmed that our story and the engine anti-ice message were related. We learned the next day when we came back to the airport that there in fact was damage to that engine and the flight was canceled for that day to return. How unfortunate that the Mechanics in ZZZ did not figure that out before we departed.		Just prior to descent Left Engine A/I caution displayed with the switch in auto. No icing conditions were encountered at the time. Non-normal was conducted but did not resolve the EICAS message. While conducting maintenance prior to departing ZZZ, the aircraft settled onto a maintenance ladder under the left engine while being fueled, ladder crushed a 1/2 inch line described to the crew as a P3 bleed air line. Aircraft was released safe for flight after a delay of less than 2 hours.		A B777 flight crew reported, during fueling, the aircraft's engine nacelle settled onto a maintenance ladder. The aircraft was jacked up and ladder removed however undiagnosed damage was overlooked involving a crushed engine anti-ice line that caused the failure of the engine anti-ice system during descent to landing at destination airport after a long ETOPS flight.

Tower told him to be advised we were departing the parallel. As the FO (First Officer) rotated and just before calling positive rate call the caravan started a left turn directly into our departure path. At the normal climb rate we were on a course to hit. I gently pushed the nose over to arrest the climb and added a slight right turn to keep us from the caravan. The climb never stopped but was only about 5 to 7 degrees nose up to prevent a midair collision. No audible calls were given from GPWS. After we got to ZZZ1 we called the Tower and talked to the Controller who was on duty during the event. He said the caravan was going to ZZZ2 (it is NE of ZZZ) and was cleared on course. At that time the caravan started a left turn to 190. The Controller had no idea the caravan was going to make a left turn. He apologized for the mishap and no further events came from the flight. Misunderstanding between Tower and the caravans intentions for going to a field that is NE of ZZZ when departing off Runway XXR. When taking off with parallel departures and GA planes taking off wait until they are clear before departure. Keep an eye out for departure paths from GA aircraft.		After being cleared to take off of Runway XXL out of ZZZ what looked to be a Cessna caravan had departed off of the parallel runway (XXR), and as I began my rotation and initial climb out the caravan turned left of a heading of approximately 190 directly into our flight path. It was at this time and at a radio altitude between 60-100 ft. RA that the Captain took the controls and arrested the ascent but did not stop the climb (between 5-7 degrees nose up) and made a slight right turn to avoid what would have been a midair collision. There were no callouts from the GPWS. After landing at ZZZ1 the Captain and I called the Tower and we were able to speak to the Controller who was on duty at the time of the event and he explained to us that he was confused about the direction of the caravan as he was cleared on course to ZZZ2 which is northeast of ZZZ, however as previously stated and confirmed by the Controller on Duty at the time of the event the caravan turned to a heading of 190. The Controller stated that he cleared the caravan 'on course' and again, the caravan turned left 190 directly into our flight path. There were no other issues or events for the remainder of the flight.Gross misunderstanding between the Controller and the Cessna caravan.When departing parallel runways and flying in proximity to GA aircraft, take off one at a time or wait until clear before departure.		Flight crew reported a Resolution Advisory on take off from parallel runways. The Captain assumed command and reduced the rate of climb until clear of the other aircraft.

Lead FA (Flight Attendant) called about 1/2 way into the flight and stated FA's in the back of [the aircraft] were experiencing headaches. We tried to gather information on the situation. They stated stuffy air in the back. Aircraft started out very warm from ZZZ but at that time it showed below 70 in the back. Forward FA was not experiencing any issues. MEL for HPV complicated the issue. It had opposing guidance to the fume event procedure and we weren't sure if that was what we were experiencing. I focused on flying the Aircraft and the radios while the CA (Captain) worked on the event. We doned our O2 masks when they didn't see an improvement in the cabin. CA isolated the number 1 bleed system and after some time they said they saw improvement in the back cabin. We discontinued the use of the masks after we had the report of improved air quality in the back. The lead FA never did experience any adverse effects. We continued the flight and landed in ZZZ1 with no other issues. We talked with the Cabin Crew and Maintenance about the event in detail.				Air Carrier First Officer reported the aft flight attendants were experiencing symptoms due to 'stuffy air' in the aft cabin. Captain initiated the QRH procedure to isolated the number 1 bleed system which improved the the air quality. The flight continued to a safe landing where crew conferred with Maintenance.

So there was no door check performed prior to Dispatch by us the Maintenance Team and I found out today that flight crew also did not do a door check or walk around of aircraft and did not notice the overhead warning light on prior to Dispatch. I take responsibility for not making sure that the Mechanics I assigned to Dispatch the ferry flight were to do a walk around checking all doors for security.

I was flying and primarily watching outside with a short scan inside. I can't remember if I called for flaps 1 or 5 first. Regardless, when I thought I had the flaps at 5, I called for the landing gear down and flaps 15 before arriving at the FAF. I then looked at the flap gauge, because the aircraft didn't feel right (felt nose high but we were bouncing around) and noticed the flaps were indicating between UP and 1. We executed a go-around.  We examined the gauge and saw they were split. This was confirmed by the control inputs I was feeling. Captain ran the checklist and coordinated with Flight Attendants and Passengers. I flew and worked ATC. We completed the checklist and proceeded in to Runway XXR. Landing was uneventful. We cleared and held on Taxiway between 8 and 9 where the fire trucks met us. We coordinated for a discreet frequency to talk with them and and asked they keep an eye on the wheels for smoke/fire/abnormalities and also asked them to get a temp reading.  Fire said the brakes were hot but didn't see any smoke or other indications. We re-examined the brake cooking data that we got while on downwind. We discovered an error of using manual braking and no reverses. That was changed to reflect air bulletin X as directed by the landing data and max reverse. The new brake cooling data gave us a 30 minute cool down and allowed for taxi. We slowly taxied and waited for the remaining time before arriving at the gate.		On visual approach to XXL after initial flaps were selected, we had an asymmetrical trailing edge indication as noted on the flap gauge and a very subtle roll. I called for go around and we were boxed back around. We ran the appropriate checklist and brake cooling. I talked to the Flight Attendants and Passengers. We had an uneventful landing. We had Fire and Rescue waiting; we stopped after exiting the runway and let them visually inspect tires and brakes. Slow taxi to a spot to complete our remaining cooling time before pulling into gate. Logbook entry, talked to Maintenance and Dispatch.		B737-700 flight crew reported an asymmetrical trailing edge indication leading to a go around, then a normal landing.

Flap indications were normal (indicator aligned) during preflight, and flaps deployed normally for takeoff. After takeoff the flaps retracted normally, and there was no adverse or abnormal trim required for flight. The indicator showed a slight split that we saw during cruise. In anticipation of a potential problem, the FO (First Officer, Pilot Monitoring) and I reviewed the flap scenarios from the QRH enroute 'just in case' the flaps didn't extend and were somewhat prepared for this. The WX was good, and we had extra ferry fuel to play with. When ATC wanted us to slow during the arrival phase we were unable. We [advised ATC] and asked for a vector while we ran a checklist. They vectored us downwind to an area and gave us box vectors over the lake. We initially went with the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry checklist, which took us to the Trailing Edge Flaps Up Landing Checklist due to the Lever being UP to match the closest flaps setting. The leading edge devices deployed correctly using the alternative method IAW the checklist. I briefed the FAs as to the situation and the precautionary landing IAW the non-routine landing considerations and briefed the passengers of the situation and that we would be doing a faster than normal landing and that safety vehicles would be present to inspect the brakes due to the speed. We attempted to contact ZZZ ops to no avail, and I was unsure if crew phone would work at 4K', so I elected to bypass that part. With checklists complete, and a pause to make sure we were both in the loop and comfortable with the scenario thus far, we advised ATC we were ready for the approach to 28C with flaps up, leading edge devices extended. We had also previously requested response vehicles at the runway out of an abundance of caution and to inspect the brakes due to the speed of the landing. We were below max landing weight. Approach was as normal as you can get for the situation, the landing was smooth, and I applied judicious brakes to go along with the reversers. We taxied clear of the runway with several thousand feet remaining. I reminded the pax to remain seated while we had the brakes inspected, then taxied to the gate normally. After deplaning I held the crew for a quick debrief and to let a couple of them decompress. After landing the flaps indicator aligned back normally, however I made sure the write up indicated the split. Aircraft had previous write up for flaps not deploying, which was signed off by maintenance the day prior. The write up did not indicate an asymmetry, or even if the aircraft had been in flight when it occurred. On another note, the FO (PM) did an outstanding job of pacing, monitoring, and working through the processes. The ZZZ personnel were very supportive and present quickly when we got to the gate. I don't think I could set up a more 'like a simulator' scenario if I tried. We had enough of a break to decompress a bit and were fit to continue the day. Maintenance unable to replicate previous condition as it was written in the logbook. Given that everything worked normally until it didn't, I don't think I have preventive measures for this incident. This is why we get trained and paid.				B737 Captain reported conducting a no flap landing after the flaps would not deploy and noted the aircraft was signed off by maintenance for the same issue a day prior to the flight.

Rain was in a tempo line in the forecast. The ATIS was calling VFR with light and variable winds. We ran the landing data for the runway condition in case the rain started at the field. When we started the descent, we could see rain at the field on the radar. We were handed off to ZZZZ Approach, and no one would answer. It took a few minutes for Tower to get a hold of Approach to come up on the frequency. The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF), and did a nice job to get back on profile after being delayed in the descent due to the lack of communication with approach. I asked Approach multiple times what the weather at the field was. It took a while for him to get back to us, but he just said rain. Tower said the same. I believe Tower added winds at 130 at 8 KIAS. We saw the field above minimums and the FO continued and landed. We ended up getting pushed to the left side of the runway. I'm not sure if we were pushed by a gust of wind or if we had any hydroplaning. We weren't sure how close we were to the edge. It was hard to tell with the rain at night which made it impossible to see the centerline. The speed brakes deployed normally and the FO deployed the reversers The FO corrected back to centerline. I came on the brakes and took the aircraft shortly after. I felt us hit a patch of water momentarily and felt the auto brakes cycle. We were at taxi speed well before the taxiway and taxied to the ramp. We conducted a post flight inspection and found no indication of damage to the aircraft. We had the same aircraft for the return leg to ZZZ the next morning. The FO conducted the preflight in the daylight and again found no damage. We could have possibly entered a hold at the IAF, but I don't think we would have received a better weather report from Tower or the Approach Controller. They only told us there was rain at the field without any intensity description or updated ceiling/visibility.		First Officer pilot flying (PF). Night flight on descent and approach to ZZZZ, we were aware of thunderstorms near the airport. We had the most current weather reports and calculated landing data for a wet runway even though the field was reported to be in good conditions without rain. Struggles began with Approach Control not responding to our calls. We called the Tower, and they asked us to try Approach frequency again. Back and forth we got the report from the Tower that there was rain at the field. Selecting autobrakes 3, and quickly emphasizing a landing on a wet, ungrooved runway at night, we were ready for the approach and landing. The airport runway lights were in view so we continued to landing. Fully configured and on profile, we touched down in the touchdown zone. Speedbrakes and reversers deployed we started our roll out but I noticed we were drifting to the left of the runway very quickly. Very quickly we corrected back to centerline. The Captain took control and we rolled to a taxi speed and taxied to the gate.  We don't know how close to runway edge we had come because of limited visibility, night and rain. We conducted a postflight inspection which revealed no evidence of damage to the aircraft. We had the same aircraft the next morning. With the sun out, I did the preflight inspection of the entire plane focusing on the left side, again to find no evidence of damage, or any reports from maintenance. We departed to ZZZ without incident.Afterwards, I believe that with a slick, slippery runway, we may have either hydroplaned, or simply got blown to the left from a right crosswind. With limited visibility, it was very difficult to recognize. Again, approach, landing and touchdown were nothing but normal. This is a very challenging approach especially during the wet season when it's at night, and all you have is runway edge lighting, no approach light system, and no centerline lighting. It might be prudent to change the arrival time to daytime during the wet season but that's beyond my paygrade!		Air carrier flight crew reported after the landing roll out started, on a wet runway with a crosswind, the aircraft began drifting off the center line. The pilot flying corrected the deviation and returned to the center line.

NAME was the pilot flying and I was the pilot monitoring. It was an uneventful departure and climb to cruise. At cruising altitude in the low 30's we were in VMC. We received the ECAM 'ANTI ICE F/O L STAT F/O R STAT'. NAME started to perform the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) actions. Simultaneously I noticed a burning electrical smell. NAME then noticed the smell as well. We both don our oxygen mask then. NAME handed me the controls and we made the decision to divert. ZZZ2 was approximately 177 miles from our current position. While we were still able to smell an electrical burning there was no visible smoke coming into the cockpit and the intensity of the smell seemed to be constant. NAME called the cabin and informed the cabin crew that we were diverting, and we were code yellow. He also made a customer PA. I sent an ACARS off to Dispatch. I believe I told them Avionics Smoke and we were diverting to ZZZ2. I then requested priority handling with ATC. I informed ATC of our situation and we wanted to divert to ZZZ2. We were cleared direct ZZZ2. ATC took the standard information of SOB, and fuel. I informed ATC that it was going to be an overweight landing. I updated the FMS with a new destination and loaded the ILS XX at ZZZ2 since that was the approach in use per the current ATIS. During this time NAME was running the 'Smoke/Fumes/Avionics Smoke' QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). Name called the cabin asked them if they smelled anything or noticed anything unusual. They reported they did not. During our descent, the burning smell did dissipate. However, we stayed on our oxygen mask. NAME then ran the overweight landing QRH and landing data performance. Dispatch sent us a new flight summary and how much overweight we were predicting to be. Once NAME finished with the overweight QRH he took control. NAME briefed the approach, and we ran the descent check list. NAME also performed his 10000 foot flow. I also took a glance at the checklist and the overweight check list to back NAME up on it. About this time, we were about to check on with ZZZ2 approach. We updated ZZZ2 approach of our current situation. We were planning a negative evacuation and we wanted to stop on the runway for inspection. We also asked for direct ZZZZZ for the ILS XX. We got cleared as requested and cleared for the approach. When we were handed off to tower, I restated what our intentions were. We had a normal landing and came to a stop just prior to 'B'. NAME made the 'remain seated call' and Tower put us on another frequency. I thought this was a direct frequency to CFR (Crash Fire Rescue). But it was another tower frequency. It did lead to some confusion because I put this new frequency into radio 2 while listening to radio 1. I reached out to CFR to tell them where to inspect the aircraft. When the controller started talking to CFR I did not realize right away he was speaking on both frequencies. It caused me to unnecessary switch back to radio 1 while CFR was on radio 2. Once I figured that out, we had CFR inspect the front of the aircraft since we knew the issue was in the avionics bay. CFR reported an all clear. We then contacted ground and taxied clear of the runway. Once clear we preformed the after landing check list. I contacted ops for our gate assignment. We were cleared into C-1. We pulled into the gate. We deplaned the aircraft as normal. CFR came up to the cockpit to asked what happen. I explained to them what happen. Maintenance met the aircraft. He found one of the computers below my seat burned itself up and was still hot to the touch. He did not know why the circuit breaker did not pop. From this point forward the customers were inside the terminal. The difficulty of using the O2 mask and communication. Without the head set on it was difficult to hear. With the head set on, it was difficult to hear over your own breathing getting picked up in the microphone. We did solve this by going 'cold' mic in between sentences. However, you need to be aware of that. We did slow down to 250 knots at 10,000 feet. Should we have kept the speed up? It was not necessary at that point but, I believe we slowed down more out of habit. While we do go over the EVAS in training. It is not second nature if we had to use it. Especially since we are shown how to use it standing up.		Enroute from ZZZ-ZZZ1 at 320 received ECAM ANTI ICE F/O STAT. We both immediately smelled a strong burning odor. We put our masks on and established communication. I passed flying duties to my FO, performed the ECAM, and initiated the QRH Smoke/Fumes/Avionics Smoke checklist. I called my Cabin Crew to determine if they could smell the odor and they could not. We coordinated with Dispatch and agreed on ZZZ2 as our divert, declared a code yellow, informing them that we would be landing in 15-20 minutes. I also made several PAs to our customers informing them of the situation and telling them exactly what we were doing and what would happen when on the ground. No visible smoke was present but the burning smell persisted so we kept the speed up in our descent and exceeded 250 knots below 10,000 feet for a brief period. We performed the overweight landing checklist and made an uneventful landing in ZZZ2. We stopped on the runway and had CRF visually inspect the aircraft prior to taxiing clear. Once on the ground the contract maintenance tech determined that a Pitot Heat Controller had malfunctioned/shorted out.		A320 flight crew reported smoke and fumes in the cockpit with ECAM 'ANTI ICE F/O L STAT F/O R STAT' Illuminated. The flight crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

Ran the QRH and turned the pump off. Coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance over HF and decide to continue as we had normal pressure and adequate quantity. Just prior to the CP, the reservoir started fluctuating and dropped to 20%. still had 2,950 PSI. over the next 2 hours the quantity fluctuated between 0 and 7%. we discussed the possibility of losing the associated electric pump and the whole A system and looked over the QRH so we were prepared for it on descent into ZZZ1. Both pressures were approximately 2,950 PSI most of the flight. On descent to ZZZ1 we got system B Engine Driven Pump low pressure and ran the QRH again. Turned the pump off and requested priority handling. Requested XXL and notified Dispatch and Flight Attendants. Gear came down slower than normal and flaps as well. We configured normal and landed normal. Brakes worked normal as well as nose wheel steering. System B quantity and pressure seemed to remain normal. Taxied to the gate and Maintenance opened the #1 engine cowl to find hydraulic fluid everywhere. I left before they addressed the #2 engine.		The ENG 1 hydraulic low pressure light illuminated in cruise flight. We ran the checklist from the QRH, which only says to turn the pump off. Within approximately 30-60 minutes, the quantity in the A system dropped to 20%. This is commensurate with the level of the standpipe in the A reservoir. It was our thinking that the engine-driven pump in the A system failed and a leak occurred in that pump or associated lines. Over the course of the flight, the quantity in the A system fluctuated between 13-0%, I surmise because of cold-soaking of the remaining fluid. At all times the electric hydraulic pump in the A system remained on with good pressure at 3,000 PSI. We talked on HF radio with Maintenance and Dispatch. They couldn't think of anything else we could do. It was at times difficult to understand them, which is consistent with typical performance of HF. SATCOM would have been a welcome tool.We reviewed checklists for possible scenarios, including loss of A system pressure, and even loss of A and B system pressure, and we discussed possibilities. After evaluating all options, we decided to press on to ZZZ1. The B system was working fine, the A system still had good pressure, and there were no issues with the Standby hydraulic system. We were expecting a normal landing. At worst, we thought we may have to do a manual gear extension if the A system electric pump stopped producing good pressure.At top of descent into ZZZ1, at the exact moment the thrust levers retarded for descent, the ENG 2 hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. We ran the QRH checklist and turned that pump off as well. We were both a bit confused as to why the B system engine-driven pump would fail. It was unexpected. Because we now had two major pump failures in separate systems, we requested priority handling with ATC and requested Runway XXL, the longest runway. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch, and did a briefing with the Purser. I also made a PA to the passengers and said we expected a normal landing, but they may see some emergency equipment standing by. We configured early, and flaps and gear slowly came down. Good pressure and quantity were maintained on the B side with the electric pump throughout the remainder of the flight. A side hydraulic pressure also remained at 3,000 PSI. Last I saw, quantity on the A side was 11% and B side was at 96%. Landing and taxi in were uneventful.On the ground, the Mechanics opened the #1 engine cowling and hydraulic fluid was dripping out. They also seemed confused as to why the B system engine-driven pump would have failed. I plan to follow up on that with Maintenance to learn as much as I can.		B737 NG flight Crew reported a Hydraulic System A EDP pressure low light on during cruise. The flight crew elected to continue the flight. The A Hydraulic System subsequently lost most system quantity. On descent, The System B EDP also failed. The flight crew requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing at the destination airport.

Once complete, referenced QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) Airspeed Unreliable. We determined that the Standby and First Officer instruments were working properly. After assessing situation, decided to return to ZZZ. Notified Passengers. Notified Dispatch, coordinated air return to ZZZ. Once all QRH steps completed, coordinated for approach to ZZZ. On final, flap indication of 25 disagreed with 30 selected. Initiated go-around. On go-round selected flaps 15, per normal procedure. Left the flaps at 15 for subsequent flight, while further assessing the situation. Coordinated for vectors. Ran QRH Trailing Edge Flap Disagreed Checklist. Computed performance numbers for flaps 15 landing. Completed QRH Checklist. Landed normally with flaps 15 at ZZZ Runway XXL. Following an uneventful landing, ran performance and weights and balance, brake cooling numbers. Two minute cooling required. Accomplished. Taxi normally to gate.		It was my leg from ZZZ to ZZZ1. On takeoff roll at approximately 80 knots, the Master Caution and 'ENG' annunciator light illuminated. The Captain called airspeed unreliable and elected to continue the takeoff. Once airborne, we received a constant Airspeed Unreliable message and intermittent Altitude Unreliable message on the PFDs (Primary Flight Display). I completed the QRC 'Airspeed Unreliable' Checklist memory items while we continued normal departure procedures. The Captain advised ATC of our situation and we were given vectors while we handled the malfunction. After completing the QRC Checklist and referencing the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook), we quickly determined the F/O and Standby indicators were providing correct airspeed and altitude information. The Captain stated his airspeed indicated low during takeoff roll and then indicated high while airborne (varying up to approximately 140 knots high). Due to the nature of the malfunction, the Captain elected to return to ZZZ. After completing all briefs and the QRH 'Airspeed Unreliable' Checklist, we were cleared for a visual XXL approach. When selecting the flaps to 30 for landing, the flap indicator stopped at 25. I initiated a standard go-around except leaving the flaps at 15 since that appeared to be reliable indication and a know configuration setting for landing. After completing the QRH 'Trailing Edge Flap Disagree' Checklist and brief items, we conducted an uneventful flap 15 visual approach and landing to Runway XXL. After clearing the runway, brake cooling did not require a gate holdout, so we proceeded to the gate.		B737 Pilots reported receiving an airspeed unreliable notification on takeoff and returned to the departure airport.

She said, and we had her confirm, that there wasn't any smoke or heat. Yet, she couldn't get the alarm to reset. Since we had started our descent and time was compressing, after discussing it with the First Officer (FO), we elected to continue to ZZZ. The FO initiated the radio call to ZZZ Center and informed them that we had the alarm sounding and would like an immediate vector and descent to ZZZ. I called the Flight Attendants and made PA to the passengers reassuring them that while the alarm was sounding we believed it to be a false alarm, nonetheless, we where heading directly to ZZZ. The ZZZ Airport Rescue and Firefighting had been called out and meet us upon our uneventful landing. At our request they scanned and did a cursory inspection and we continued to the Gate and deplaned as normal.

After climb out, my Captain reset the bleeds by the checklist. We continued our climb. Around 28,000', my Captain noticed the cabin altitude was at 10,000' so we leveled off at 28,000', saw it was still climbing and started a descent after letting ATC know. By the time we got to 27,000, the cabin alt warning went off. We donned our O2 masks and established communication. My Captain started doing all his tasks, and I started a priority descent, being vectored by ATC towards ZZZZ1. Once passing through 10,000' we removed our masks, and continued through all the checklists, and calls to dispatch, and the FA's, etc etc. Once the Captain had caught up with those duties, we turned back inbound on the approach to Runway XX at ZZZZ1, where we performed and overweight landing. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) checked our brakes for temp, and we proceed to the gate. We were familiar with the bleeds off takeoff, having performed it 2 days prior. Upon thinking back afterward, when the Captain did the bleeds reset, he remembered that the bleed pressures did not come back up when reset. I did not see the pressures because I was hand flying at the time. The Captain had also just come off X months of leave and was his first trip back flying. It was also a very long day, 3 legs, previous leg had 2 plane swaps, delaying us, and putting us just a few minutes shy of a max 13 hr duty day. I should have been watching more closely when he changed bleeds and I might have caught it.				B737 Pilot reported a pressurization problem with the aircraft during climb and returned for a precautionary landing.

At Gate on APU very mild dirty socks smell nothing worse than normal. On takeoff the smell became strong, 'Level 1' dirty sock/musty/waxy smell. No suspected or known causes. Odor dissipated climbing through FL180. Upon Leveling off at FL350 odor was gone. Flight Attendant (FA) reported mild dizziness and throat irritation but felt fine once at cruise altitude. No complaints from any passengers. Odor throughout the whole cabin and flight deck. On climb out we checked all systems and everything was fine. Started looking into QRH and sent dispatch message. Quickly the smell dissipated so we decided not to follow QRH. Repeatedly checked on FA's and everyone felt fine. FA's filled out air quality form. I decided to put on oxygen for 10 minutes and then take off my mask to see if I could smell any signs of lingering odor which I could not detect. Continued flight to ZZZ as planned. On descent passing through FL227 the same odor returned and became stronger as we continued approach and landing. On descent we again reviewed QRH to be prepared in case conditions worsened. Once on ground we switched to APU then ground air and odor once again dissipated. Debriefed with FA's, Flight Operations Duty Officer, dispatch, and maintenance. No crew or passengers required medical assistance.				Air carrier Captain reported 'dirty socks' odor during climb which dissipated during cruise. The odor resumed during descent until landing where ultimately switched to ground air causing odor to dissipate.

An Airbus landed 3 miles ahead of us and another aircraft departed Runway 9. While on very short final, I was the Pilot Flying with the automation off and we hit some wake turbulence around 50 ft. AGL and experienced a rolling event. I added power and corrected the rolling event and then proceeded to land in the touchdown zone safely, but it was a longer landing than desired. After debriefing, my Captain and I both agreed it would have been better to go around and try the landing again.		At short final 50 ft AGL we experienced a roll moment slightly above flare. At the moment of the event the First Officer was hand flying and immediately corrected the roll. The result of un-commanded roll resulted in a longer than normal landing. Still touched down in the touchdown zone but a float did happen. Pilot reaction and skill landed the aircraft safely but not happen in the normal cadence. Weather was VFR wind 150/5 landing 4R 10 miles and clear. Airbus 3 miles in front landed and an aircraft took off from Runway 9 as we approached.

Actual times are 4 hours awake and 3 hours on duty. Flight was normal all the way up to and including cruise at FL 340. Upon climbing out of cruise from FL340 to FL 360, the First Officer (FO) airspeed indicator started increasing and the IAS disagree annunciation appeared on both ADI's. Moments later the alt disagree annunciator appeared on both ADI's, as well. The FO airspeed was approaching Mach limit and the over speed clacker annunciated. Initial action Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) items were completed and it was determined that the Captain (CA) airspeed and altitude information was correct and matched the standby instruments. Manual pitch and power settings for flaps up were also used to confirm the reliability of the operating CA airspeed and altimeter. The Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) checklist for airspeed unreliable was executed and all steps complied with. Aircraft was no longer RVSM compliant and ATC directed a decent to FL 280. This put our fuel status in a state that would no longer reach our scheduled destination of ZZZ1. The CA contacted Maintenance and there was no available solution to remedy the aircraft status. After working with dispatch, ZZZ2 was determined to be the best divert location. At that time we requested priority and requested routing to ZZZ2. After setting up for the arrival and approach into ZZZ2 for XXL, we started to descend from FL280. During the descent, the FO airspeed began rapidly decreasing to the point where the FO airspeed was bottomed out at 45 kts passing FL180 while the CA airspeed read 250. While the aircraft entered the stall warning red zone, the stick shaker did NOT activate. Overweight landing checklist was also ran. After descending through approximately 13000 ft., the FO airspeed and altimeter readings appeared to revert back to normal and match the CA's and standby readings. Landing and taxi to park were uneventful. Also on descent during the recall check, the FO noticed an engine warning and both EEC's were in alternate mode. Checklists were ran for that condition and the engines operated in alternate mode for the rest of the flight. Alternate mode was not displayed after engine shut down.		While in a step climb from FL340-360 we received an Airspeed Disagree message. We complied with the immediate action items, and the Altitude Disagree message closely followed. I noticed the First Officer's (F/O's) airspeed was increasing and approaching the redline. My airspeed and altitude appeared accurate, and after running the Quick Reference Checklist (QRC)/ (QRH) Quick reference Handbook, we determined my side was accurate. We informed ATC that we were no longer RVSM capable and they told us to descend to FL280. After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance we determined a diversion to ZZZ2 would be the most prudent option. We [requested priority landing] and requested routing to ZZZ2. We knew we would have to land overweight so we consulted that non-normal procedure also. We noticed that the F/O'S airspeed indicator was increasing if we climbed and decreased when we descended. At redline the high speed warning came on. During descent the airspeed decrease all the way down to 45 KIAS. Fortunately the stick shaker never came on so there was one less distraction. We accomplished a normal descent, visual approach and landing. We had a normal taxi into the gate. During the descent at around 13000msl, the F/O's instruments started reading normal and the warnings went away. This was my F/O's very first leg of OE. It was quite the welcome to [the company] but he performed very well.		B737 flight crew reported the First Officer's airspeed indicator was unreliable and a diversion was necessary.

After brief discussion, it was agreed that the odor smelled like magic marker, or sharpie marker. Descending through 11,000 ft., with the engines at idle in open descent, the odor became much stronger. No smoke was noticed in the flight deck. The flight was cleared directly to the IAF for the ZZZZ approach. The pilots briefly referenced Quick Reference Handbook S-7 (Fumes), and determined a diversion was necessary. ZZZZ was the closest, and safest, airport under the current situation, and the flight continued to its scheduled destination of ZZZZ. Time did not allow for any additional troubleshooting as the aircraft was already being configured for landing. The flight landed in ZZZZ approximately 11 minutes after the odor was first discussed. After landing, the flight deck windows were opened for fresh air ventilation, and oxygen was used intermittently by the Captain. After parking at the gate, a logbook entry was completed, an Aircraft type Cabin Odor Report was completed, and a detailed discussion commenced with ZZZZ Tech-Ops. It was discussed that the APU had been deferred as per MEL from a previous flight. A logbook history review also revealed this aircraft had a recent history of odor/fume events. The Inflight Crew members stated they didn't smell any odor in the cabin until the flight deck door was opened at the gate. After reviewing the 'Cockpit / Cabin Odor Recognition and Isolation' guide in the Supplemental Procedures section of FCOM Vol. 1, the event was identified as a Level 3. It was suggested that Engine #1 Bleed, or Pack #1, was the most likely source of the odor/fumes. Both pilots contacted Med-link as directed by the Chief Pilot on duty.				A320 Captain reported a fumes event during descent which was localized to the flight deck area.

In that time I sent an ACARS to dispatch about a diversion to ZZZZ and advised ATC. We were cleared direct to ZZZZ and descent to a lower altitude. Oil pressure was still slowly dropping so I used the remaining time to three chime the Flight Attendants and [advise them] and make a PA. Oil pressure dropped to red line and we shut down and secured the #2 engine per the QRH procedure. I then ran the numbers for an overweight single engine landing distance and briefed the FO the QRH information. Together we briefed an RNP approach and I completed all regular checklist items as well as abnormal landing QRH items. I then checked in with the Flight Attendants and briefed them for a normal landing and plan to stop on the runway with airport rescue and fire-fighting (ARFF). We were then cleared for the RNP approach with the airport in sight and I supported the FO with the task at hand. After a normal touchdown and rollout we stopped and I made the immediate PA to remain seated. After ARFF checked the aircraft I made another PA before taxiing to the ramp area and securing the aircraft.

After discussing the need to burn fuel and landing distance penalties, the final decision to continue to ZZZ1 and we recovered the aircraft uneventfully. We had to stop straight ahead on the runway and get a tug back to the gate. Bottom line, training, good threat and error management, along with outstanding CRM and aircraft operating as designed when a system fails allowed a safe and uneventful day for all.

The instructions need to be in a larger font and color to stand out. Also have the northern sections of ZZZ Center give the runway assignment in the clearance. They did not know what we were talking about until we got on with the next controller who explained it better. Also having to reprogram the FMS and altitude in the terminal area can cause confusion and error. Add 'pop up thunderstorms' in the terminal area the crews will be task loaded at a time when we need to mitigate errors.				Air carrier Captain reported new MetroPlex arrival charts in need of clarification of 'Descend via' clearance and early runway assignment.

ATC had us at 250 knots, until the 747 had about 10 miles on us. The ride was smooth in the climb and we were given a climb to FL 360. Climbing out of FL 321, we hit the 747's wake turbulence. The aircraft pitched up and made a hard right turn. The First Officer did a fantastic job of controlling the aircraft and disengaged the autothrottles and autopilot and returned the aircraft to straight and level flight. I made a call to ATC and requested to descend to FL320. I then called the Flight Attendants to check on them. I was told that two of them were in the aisle doing their service and one was in the forward galley. The two that were out, reported that they were airborne but felt ok. I sent Dispatch a message about the turbulence and to have Maintenance notified. About five to seven minutes later, I called again to make sure everyone was still ok. They told me we had a lady who had a pacemaker complaining that her pacemaker was sore. We were about 70 miles from ZZZ, so I decided to ask for special handling. We were given straight to the field and landed uneventfully. We requested medical meet the aircraft, with both Dispatch and ATC. EMT met the aircraft and attended to the lady. No other passengers mentioned anything about injuries while deplaning. At the gate, I called Dispatch and spoke with Dispatch, Maintenance, Supervisor on Duty, and a Company Operations Center Chief Pilot. The First Officer and I agreed we were ok to continue to ZZZ1 for the overnight. While en route to ZZZ1, one of the Flight Attendants came to the cockpit and asked us to send Dispatch a message about the three of them being pulled for the next day. We talked to the chief at the Company Operations Center and were given the opportunity to continue or not. On this event, we agreed to continue, but I'm not sure the Flight Attendants should have continued. I asked them numerous times and they all said they were fine, but I think once the adrenaline settled down, they regretted flying. I know every event is different and unique but why give the crew the option? You can read about wake turbulence but until you experience it like our event, you really do not have any idea what to expect. The aircraft was 10 miles ahead with a cross wind but we were hit hard from it. The First Officers training definitely kicked in and he performed the aircraft upset well.

We got distracted with the new climb gradients for the different runways and just missed it. When we began leveling at 7,000 feet, Departure asked us if we'd been assigned the hold-down by clearance or Tower as they have been doing that still as that's what they are used to doing. We looked at our clearance again and saw our mistake. We let the Controller know it had been our mistake. He let us know there was no issue with our leveling off and cleared us to 16,000 feet.		During the Pre-Departure Brief, neither Pilot recognized the new climb via altitude for the ZZZZZ SID from ZZZ Runway XXL had changed to 16,000 feet. We leveled at 7,000 feet, which was the previous climb via altitude for that runway and the current claim via altitude for the south runways. ATC asked us why we had leveled at 7,000 feet and stated they have had several aircraft doing the same thing and were just trying to get to the bottom of why. Ultimately I think we had become complacent because we had both flown that departure many times being based in ZZZ. We missed the change to the procedure as a result.		Air Carrier flight crew reported a 'climb via' altitude clearance deviation due to missing a recent altitude change. ATC notified the flight crew of the deviation and issued a new climb clearance.

I told Tower we aborted takeoff due to a door annunciation, and turned off the runway. Tower asked if we needed to return to gate or were planning to takeoff again, we said we needed a few minutes, but likely would take off. After parking, we spoke to cabin crew, Flight Attendant in aft said that the door handle showed slightly up. She made sure handle was pushed down, and our indications showed door was closed again. After rerunning checklists, we proceeded to takeoff again, with no further abnormalities noted.Possible failure to recheck aft door after catering came to aircraft, bumps in taxiway and runway may have jarred door handle loose.We felt that this highlights the importance of briefing each Flight Attendant about the need to check each door handle is fully down and closed.				B737-800 First Officer reported rejecting the takeoff at 35 kts due to a cabin door light. After positioning the door handle full down the light went out and the flight departed.

Conducted thorough briefings with all Flight Attendants and the First Officer. Must have glanced right over the Flight Director lights on preflight. During the Before Takeoff Checklist 'Flight Instruments and Bugs' Challenge, I could have sworn I saw a pink over blue bugs on the dim basic screens amidst the bright direct sunlight, and now realize I had dropped the 1 Flight Director 2 from my habitual cross check for that item, even though that isn't in the AOM. Cleared for takeoff, lined up on centerline and advanced the throttles to the second detent for a rolling flex takeoff. Did not see 'FLEX' on the FMA, and selected Takeoff Go Around to see if that would help. After seeing that did not result in 'Takeoff Go Around' either, I called 'Reject, My Aircraft' at what I thought was just shy of 80 KIAS. Max auto-braking commenced, which I attempted unsuccessfully to override with manual braking for a couple seconds. As the aircraft came to a rocking stop, I pressed the PA button and stated ' This is the Captain, remain seated, remain seated, remain seated' and the First Officer advised ATC. We taxied off the runway on X, and followed Ground's instructions to turn left on Y and hold short of XY. I made another PA stating we had an unsafe cockpit indication after applying takeoff thrust, and would need to turn to the gate for maintenance. The First Officer was first to realize the Flight Directors were off as we taxied clear of the runway, and quickly concluded my preflight oversight led to our situation. I called Dispatch connect to the Maintenance Center, who informed us a maintenance inspection would be required for any reject at or above 80 KIAS. We returned to the same departure gate where I coordinated with the #1 and Gate Agent before making the FOM DOT Extended Delay (opportunity to deplane) PA, and sent an ACARS message to Dispatch with the PA time XA:13.1. Missed Flight Director lights on preflight.2. Distracted by limited time to prepare for an impromptu vacation, devised after losing scheduled vacation to COVID illness.3. Had been trying to drop this trip for over a week, but with Chiefs only authorized to must-have Employee Off days for family emergencies, I ended up preparing as much as I could for a 7 day vacation day prior to the sequence, knowing I had a list of things to accomplish in the eight hours between the conclusion of my sequence and departing with my family for the airport. That wouldn't have been necessary if our system allowed the same credit as actual pay for SA days; a systemic problem that creates an 18-day work month. Another solution commonly available to most corporate employees in the U.S. would be converting vacation lost to COVID to sick days, and permitting the employee to convert later work days to the vacation lost. Vacation best maintains employee mental health and job satisfaction when it is dedicated to quality family time, not to quarantining at home with active COVID.1. Consider adding a 1 Flight Director 2 check to the Takeoff Data and Speeds item of the Before Takeoff Checklist.2. Make sick time credit equal to pay.3. Allow pilots who can document sick during vacation to convert days to sick and gain back vacation time balance 4. Permit must-have Employee Off days on a case by case basis without overly constraining the evaluation criteria.				Air carrier Captain reported the Flight Directors were not turned on which resulted in no airspeed bugs displaying during the takeoff roll. After the takeoff roll started the takeoff was rejected by the Captain and the flight returned to the gate.

The aircraft was very hot and duct temperatures were exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Landing gear was retracted and the odor seemed to increase initially. There were no warning lights illuminated in the flight deck. We [requested priority] and the decision was made for an immediate return to ZZZ. Flight Attendants, Passengers and Dispatch were notified of our situation. Fumes began dissipating on downwind, but duct temperature would not decrease.We ran appropriate checklists and landing data and prepared for an overweight landing on Runway XX. Upon landing we had the fire trucks inspect the aircraft for signs of fire or smoke. None were noted. We then taxied back to the gate with a fire truck following to confirm no signs of smoke or fire. Upon arrival at gate and after checking on Flight Attendants and Passengers, Dispatch and Maintenance were called and logbook entries were made for discrepancies and overweight landing.		Just after takeoff from Runway XXR in ZZZ. Both Pilots could smell something burning. Supply duct temperature was over 110 with both air/mix valves full cold. Passing approximately 2500 ft. we elected to return to ZZZ. We [requested priority handling] and leveled off. We began to set up on downwind for landing back at ZZZ. During that time, Flight Attendants reported they could smell what they assessed to be plastic burning. In coordination with ATC the flight setup to land on Runway XX. The flight conducted an overweight landing on Runway XX without incident. Airport Rescue and Firefighting trucks met the aircraft and conducted and exterior inspection. They did not see any visible smoke or fire. Flight taxied to gate without further incident.		B737-700 Captain reported a burning odor and faint smoke at liftoff accompanied with a very hot duct temperature. Flight requested priority handling for an immediate air return to departure airport where a safe overweight landing was executed.

After an uneventful departure and initial cruise at FL350, ATC routed us direct to ZZZZZ intersection, where we remained in radar contact and VHF coverage. I completed the cruise checks on the system status pages and noted no abnormalities. Approximately 1 hour after takeoff and 100 NM prior to ZZZZZ we received an AIR (L) WING LEAK ECAM. FO Name remained the PF and I ran the ECAM and checklists. I noted that on the system status bleed page the engine bleed valve (L) had closed and the crossed bleed valve was shut. After finishing the ECAM and running the QRH, I used the SAT phone to contact both Dispatch and Operations to discuss the situation. We agreed that the most prudent option was an air-return to ZZZ as we lost the left pack as well as the use of anti-ice (and cloud avoidance couldn't be guaranteed, especially given the weather enroute due to the tropical depression). In the discussion of our circumstance with ATC, FO Name stated that ATC 'initiated the [priority handling' on their end' and after I was brought in the loop, I elected to remain in an priority status and not downgrade it as I wanted to ensure that we had the ability to remain clear of clouds.Once I finished speaking to the company, I notified the flight attendants of our intentions to return to ZZZ, with normal cabin procedures.We noted that we were dispatched with tankering fuel, and therefore would need to burn approximately 800 lbs. to get below max landing weight. I asked for several early step-downs (as there were no clouds between us and ZZZ) as well as running the APU (but ensuring not to open the bleed valve, especially due to the wing leak). We made an uneventful approach and landing on XXL at ZZZ (below max landing weight) and parked next to the spare aircraft that we would then use to fly back to ZZZZ.				A320 Captain reported pressurization pack failed which resulted in a decision to return to the departure airport.

Other than a delay due to customers, there were no other issues. A few months ago, I had an MEL regarding the BSCU (Braking and Steering Control Unit) unit that at first glance said we could not be dispatched to an airport with a 5G NOTAM. Another pilot and I looked deeper, figured out the MEL would allow us to go, although it wasn't clearly written. Of course, we would not get dispatched an airplane that an MEL would not allow to go to that destination. This was my mindset when we looked over this MEL as well. The plane arrived at our departure time. I never got the AREQ I requested which I like to study before a flight. Once the plane arrived, we were rushed. After reading the MEL XX-XX-XXX, the FO (First Officer) and I discussed where both center fuel pumps were deferred. We were confused, because we knew we needed the center tank to get to ZZZ2 and since we had 37.1 in total fuel, we were missing something. The front of the Release had the MEL listed as well as 37.1 lbs of fuel. Again, my mindset was we would not get dispatched with an improper MEL. After all, no one would dispatch a plane that was capable. I figured I was missing something, and the FO and I discussed it further. We both agreed that the scavenger pumps must kick on once the engines are started and that it was the electric pumps that must be deferred. We confused the system of the 321 to the 320 which doesn't have scavenger pumps for the center tanks. We again discussed also that the plane would not have been dispatched to ZZZ2 if the MEL did not allow it. Once on board, we noticed that the mode selector for the center fuel tank was left in manual by the previous crew. We looked, but nowhere in the MEL does it say to select it to manual. The FO looked up in FCOM that the FLSCU (Fuel Level Sensing Control Unit) controlled the valves for fuel transfer to the wing tanks, by placing the MODE SEL to MAN it would force open the FLSCU valves allowing fuel transfer. This part of the FCOM does not specify between the 320 and the 321. This enforced our thoughts that the scavenger pumps would transfer once the engines were running. So, since the MEL said the fuel was unusable, we thought only while using the electric pumps, but not when the scavenger pumps were operating. Which we now know, the 320 doesn't have any. Maintenance was on board for another issue, and we asked for their thoughts. We had the Fuel page up showing the 10.0 lbs of fuel in the center tank. Maintenance read the MEL and looked at the Fuel page. We discussed the FCOM and FLSCU, and Maintenance said we could leave it in auto.  Now here is what I believe to be the misconnect. Thinking about the MEL I asked, 'If we leave it in auto, would it transfer fuel in the air?' Maintenance said 'Yes.' I truly believe, in hindsight, that during our conversation, I was asking about the fuel pumps working regarding the current situation, and I think Maintenance was not connecting it to the MEL but was responding about the system in general. Because our conversation involved more than just the MEL, a miscommunication occurred. However, this is the point where I felt confident to continue as I had done my due diligence and gotten clarification from maintenance: with the erroneous release, the unspecific model in the FCOM, and the discussion with Maintenance led us to mistakenly think we had the fuel as planned. Then we noticed in the air that the fuel was not transferring. We immediately got in contact with Dispatch starting with a satellite call along with Maintenance. Maintenance now informed us there was no way for the fuel to come out of the center tanks. Of course, this was the only thing we were discussing. The Dispatcher and I discussed our option, which included a stop in ZZZ3. At the time, we had an EFOB of 15.3 minus the 10.0 in the center tank which gave us an actual EFOB of 5.3. This is typical when landing in ZZZ4. We discussed it and decided to continue to monitor and make a decision as we went along. We discussed it every hour with the Dispatcher and the fuel stayed steady at an EFOB of 15.1-15.3. We decided abeam ZZZ5 would be our final go-no go decision. When we reached abeam ZZZ5 we were still showing 15.0 and the weather was fine at ZZZ2. After a discussion with Dispatch, we felt safe continuing. As we started the arrival, ZZZ2 Center shut down the arrivals due to a line of weather further east of the field along the arrival. We asked for an immediate turn back to ZZZ3. Once in the turn, the EFOB said 14.2 at ZZZ3 and ZZZ6, but 15.2 at ZZZ5. We elected to go to the nearest suitable airport.Once on the ground, we were quickly serviced, had the new dispatch, fuel and ZZZ2 had lifted the ground stop. We were wrapping up when the Maintenance desk called to say we were illegal due to [duty policy]. With the additional leg, it would have put us over 9 hours. We taxied to a gate and deplaned, where they were accommodated on another flight.				Captain reported a misapplied MEL and erroneous Dispatch release resulted in a fuel issue that required a diversion to refuel and continue to destination airport.

At the same time we received a call from the forward FA (Flight Attendant) positioned in the galley. She reported a strong order. I was PF (Pilot Flying). The CA (Captain) gave me the radios with instructions to level and standby. The CA then got a brief from the FA then informed me of the situation along with the decision to immediately return to ZZZ. With the short amount of time from event to landing I'm unsure if all QRH checklist items were done fully. The type of event dictated an expedited return over holding to isolate the cause of the smell. An overweight landing was performed and entered into the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook).In the short amount of time from takeoff to landing everyone evolved handled themselves professionally.I have nothing to add. These issues arise and the crew did a good job to get the plane turned around.		Climbing through approximately 5,000 ft. MSL abeam ZZZ I smelled a strong electrical odor like an electrical short or possible electrical fire. Almost immediately the #1 Flight Attendant (FA) called the cockpit to inform me that she also smelled a strong electrical odor. I asked the #1 FA if she saw any smoke or flames. She said she did not see and smoke or flames but told me the #2 oven was turned on and running. She said she was going to turn off the #2 oven which I said was a good idea. I then lost contact with the #1 FA on the crew interphone. I assumed she had abruptly got up to turn off the #2 oven and then would continue speaking to me on the crew interphone. I tried several times to establish contact with the #1 FA but failed. At that point I did not know what was going on in the forward galley. Was the #1 FA fighting a fire? Was the #1 FA incapacitated? Did the #1 FA just not pick up the cabin interphone after she had turned off the #2 oven? At that point I told the First Officer (FO), who was Flying Pilot (FP), to [receive priority from] ATC and request to return to ZZZ immediately. At that point I tried contacting the #1 FA again and she answered the crew interphone. She told me that she had turned off the oven and the electrical smell seemed to be lessening. I also thought at that point the strong electrical odor was decreasing. After that conversation I told the FAs that we would be returning to ZZZ for a precautionary landing in five to ten minutes. I then advised the passengers that we would be returning to ZZZ due to an 'issue' with one of our ovens. I then checked in with the FO to see if he needed any assistance at that point. He seemed to have things well in hand. ATC then asked us what runway we wanted and we chose Runway XXC. I quickly did a Descent Checklist as we were headed back to ZZZ. I quickly reviewed the non-routine landing and overweight landing checklist but did not verbalize them verbatim to the FO but quickly covered the highlights with the FO. As we were rapidly returning to and being vectored onto the ILS for XXC I did not have a chance to run the Smoke Fire and Fumes checklist. I also did not have time to send a 7700 report to Dispatch on ACARS. With the electrical odor and remembering what had happened to Swissair Flight 111 when its crew had delayed landing to run the Smoke Fire and Fumes checklist I decided to forgo that particular checklist. The FO and I ran a before landing checklist on final approach. This would be an overweight landing at 152,700 lbs. The FO made a normal landing at a normal rate of descent with auto brakes 1 and max reverse down to 60 knots at which point I took over the aircraft. ATC asked us if we wanted to stop on the runway and be inspected by ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting). I said no as the odor, at least in the cockpit, had greatly diminished and using minimal braking I did not feel we would have hot brakes. We returned to Gate X and deboarded the passengers off the aircraft. I also filled out and returned a Smoke Odors and Fumes reporting form. After we were back at the gate and the mechanics were trying to replicate the event with the #2 oven the electrical odor came back very strongly to the point the mechanics could smell it out on the jet bridge and immediately decided to take the aircraft out of service.As for not being able to completely and fully verbalize the checklists that was due to our nearness to ZZZ and the relatively short amount of time we had to prepare before landing. As for the odor and if the #2 oven was the cause of the odor: The #1 FA decided to put our crew meals in the #2 oven and turn it on so that she could give us our meals before she started her first-class service. That would be why we smelled the electrical odor so shortly after takeoff. It may have been fortuitous that this occurred at low altitude and close to ZZZ making for a quick return for landing. If this had occurred at altitude and led to smoke or fire the situation would have been much more serious.I'm not sure what can be done to prevent a possible electrical incident like this. Maintenance would probably have a better answer to this question. Probably the most important thing I learned from this incident was when the FAs and I were informal debriefing each other after this incident. They made the comment that because so many of the passengers now wear headphones and ear buds there were quite a few passengers on our flight who had no idea that we were returning to ZZZ and for what reason and were asking the FAs what was happening after we landed and were taxiing in! That could present a problem in an actual emergency if passengers have not heard an actual briefing from a crew member about what they should [do] in an emergency.		B737-800 flight crew reported a strong electrical odor during initial climb which was simultaneously reported by the #1 Flight Attendant. Flight requested special handling for an air return to departure airport where a safe landing was executed.

Full left rudder and nose wheel steering did not help. Rejected the takeoff at approximately 50 kts. After stopping and assessing we taxied off the runway and then to the gate. Aircraft taxied normally. Engine's acted fine.Completely surprised by this event and don't know the reason or cause.		Cleared for takeoff from before the hold short line for [Runway] XXL. Power was added to taxi out onto runway and line up. When pushing power up after engine stabilization the aircraft turned sharply right and we aborted. Not sure what happened from 50% to flex power. They looked like they were coming up ok as I heard the clicks of the power levers. The aircraft was already going right before we reached flex power. At that point I heard reject as Pilot Flying was outside noticing the turn before I could. I looked at the speed, I remember seeing a 4. Definitely was below 80 kts. No spoilers/auto brake activated. Stopped and assessed. Decided safe to taxi off. Returned to gate for Maintenance to check it out. Possibly a sticky brake. I don't think it was a engine stabilization issue. PF (Pilot Flying) had power up to taxi onto the runway so they were spooled. There was a time constraint of making our wheels up time but we were right at it so I didn't feel rushed. Maybe less rolling takeoffs would prevent the large abrupt turns when something goes wrong that would lead to a rejected take off.		A320 flight crew reported the aircraft veered right after applying takeoff power resulting in an aborted take off and a return to the gate.

They reported no issues with any tires so we cleared the runway and taxied to the gate. I had one of the safety vehicles follow us until we were safely parked at the gate.				B737-800 flight crew reported being contacted by ATC after takeoff with a report of possible tire failure. There was no evidence of a tire failure upon landing at destination.

We had been given [Runway] XXL for departure. Upon reaching the intersection, we were cleared for takeoff. On the takeoff roll, all appeared normal. I made the standard '80' callout and the CA (Captain) made the standard 'check' callout. I continued scanning the CA, FO (First Officer), and STBY flight instruments, as well as engine instruments on the lower DU (Display Unit). While my eyes were on the engine instruments, the CA initiated the RTO. I didn't see or feel anything abnormal during the takeoff so I was caught off guard. We finished the RTO as trained and deemed it safe to exit the runway. After coming to a stop, we talked about what we saw and the CA advised me that he was receiving erroneous airspeed data on his HUD (Heads Up Display). Due to the discrepancy in airspeed indications he was receiving, he determined it best to reject.		As Pilot Flying on takeoff roll Runway XXL intersection XX, it appeared that the HUD (Heads Up Display) air speed indications over 80 kts. were not correct. I was concerned on which indications were correct, the HUD or main display (PFD). I questioned the airworthiness of the aircraft and safety of the flight if I continued. I chose to abort before the airspeed increased too much. Max speed was 120 kts. V1 was 154 kts. Aborted and turned clear, ran brake cooling chart and called for ARF equipment to look over aircraft and brakes before returning to the gate. Entered discrepancies into the AML for the HUD anomaly and the aborted take off.		B737-800 flight crew reported incorrect airspeed indications on HUD display during takeoff roll and a subsequent rejected take off.

All QRH procedures were accomplished. Due to our original destination (ZZZ1) having a short/wet runway and performance penalties applied we needed a new destination. We talked to dispatch/maintenance over the SATCOM and ACARS. We coordinated with dispatch to make ZZZ2 our new destination where we landed without further issues. The weather in the northeast closed the ZZZ center airspace and we were rerouted due to our destination change. The flight time and fuel burned increased significantly and dispatch had to used exemption XXXXX to void the requirement of and alternate with ZZZ2 as the new destination.

I was monitoring our class B floor to ensure compliance and the FO was flying 250 knots. I stepped down his altitude as required to remain in class B. ATC  told us the airspeed was our discretion. As we approached the final marker we were high and fast.  We did not intercept the glide slope at the marker and used vertical speed to continue. At 500 feet we were stable, but I did not get our flaps to 30.  I did not hear a call and we were focused on salvaging the approach. The GPWS said 'terrain' and I thought this was an error. At 50 feet I noticed the flap gauge at 25. Our Vref was 164 knots due to gusts.  Clearly we should have gone around and I offer no excuse.		Expected ILS 35L at DEN, was given [Runway] 35R late in the descent. Pilot Flying changed ILS radio and minimus; however PF failed to change the runway in the ARR Page on the FMC. ILS 35R became visual 35R per approach control, which wasn't unexpected based on ATIS information.  When the omission of the ARR runway was realized and was entered we lost  vertical guidance on the PFD and added to the task saturation in the cockpit.  PF attempted to slow to from 250 to 210 at approx 7 miles from FRONZ (FAF for 35R) on a 45 deg dogleg vector off the CLASH Arrival.  Had to stay high due to Class B airspace airspeed restrictions, then was late to get down to 7000 feet by FRONZ which resulted in having to stay high and configure.  Aircraft was high at FRONZ and for the remainder of the approach into 35R.  Being high approaching FRONZ, attempted to utilize V/S Mode to capture the glide path, which resulted in a higher than necessary airspeed which then resulted in a late configuration and continuance above acceptable parameters for landing. Attempted to continue to recover the approach while still high and configuring the aircraft to a greater rate of descent to capture a stabilized approach.  By 500 feet, was in excess of 1000 feet per/minute and only Flaps 25 with 1 Red and 3 white on the PAPIs  Called for flaps 30 but did not verify flap movement and did not verify completion of landing checklist which would have precluded 'Too Low Terrain' annunciation. Continued to landing which was uneventful and within acceptable landing parameters on the runway.		B737 NG Flight Crew reported receiving a terrain warning on short final approach to DEN airport due to flap misconfiguration. Flight crew stated they received a late runway change which resulted in a higher-than-normal rate of descent and not completing a checklist.

While flaps were at 40 we exceeded the Flap speed and they began to blow up.  I did not realize they were in the process of blowing up and as we had achieved normal gradient I asked PF if I could move flaps to 30.  He concurred, unfortunately the blowup from overspeed was still occurring and the flap remained at 25.At approximately 200 feet we received the 'Too Low Flaps' GPWS and I saw flaps at 25, flap handle in detent at 30 and elected to increase PF's approach speed and disable GPWS system.Landing/taxi in/shut down uneventful, maintenance write up was made.

We again verified the departure SID as part of navigation brief as part of the before T/O checklist. We departed ZZZ on a 160 heading. Shortly thereafter while climbing through approximately 15,000 ft MSL we were cleared direct to the ZZZZZ fix on the Departure. We selected that fix for direct to and executed it in the FMS. We selected LMAV and verified it on the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator). The aircraft turned and flew to ZZZZZ in a climb while on the autopilot. We were switched from ZZZ1 Departure to ZZZ2 Center enroute to ZZZZZ in climb. After being cleared to climb to FL230 ZZZ2 [Center] asked us to verify what fix we were direct to at that time. We both reviewed the LEGS page immediately and discovered that the FMS had dropped 4 NAV points on the SID after the ZZZZZ fix. The FMS had taken us to ZZZZZ and reverted to heading at some point. The 4 NAV points after ZZZZZ that were dropped were ZZZZZ1, ZZZZZ2, ZZZZZ3 and ZZZZZ4. There was no annunciation that the aircraft had reverted to Heading Mode nor that the NAV points had been dropped from the FMS. Both GPS's appeared normal, there was no traffic conflict reported by ATC. There were no indications of IRS (Inertial Reference System) issues apparent. We were flying near where GPS jamming occurs sometimes but there were no NOTAMS on jamming. We were given a 170 vector for a brief time and then given direct to ZZZ1 on the SID which was still in the FMS as part of the Departure SID. We continued on in our climb and finished flight to ZZZ3. As additional note we discovered that on beginning the Arrival STAR into ZZZ3 that the preloaded altitudes for the NAV point ZZZZZ5 had dropped from the FMS. I had already verified the altitudes at ZZZZZ5 twice as the FO (First Officer) and the Captain had also verified the altitudes loaded in the FMS prior to descent. There was no annunciation of the altitudes for ZZZZZ5 dropping from the FMS. Luckily we found out ahead of the fix. After the flight we alerted maintenance and made a write up in the maintenance logbook. There were no more issues during the flight.				Air carrier First Officer reported the FMC dropped 4 navigational fixes in the routing, causing a course deviation. The First Officer stated the aircraft was in an area of reported GPS jamming.

We extended our duty, multiple passenger issues (including a full deplane and reboard hrs later), 5 releases, an over fuel, multiple Flight Attendants timed out because of legality issues, performance issues due to wind and temps in ZZZ, and multiple extensive ZZZ1 delays due to gate issues and WX. I have provided this information to give you a complete picture of our environment and mindset of that day. We were going to depart Runway XX in ZZZ. It was to be a bleeds off take off so the QRH was run. The takeoff roll was normal with thrust set and checked. The 100 knots call was made and then I noticed the EGT dial was full red. I brought it to the Captain's attention and he rejected. My best guess is that we were at 110 knots. The rejection was executed properly with all appropriate calls made. We ran the QRH and then QRH for the rejection and the exceedance. The trucks were also called. After consulting with [airport] response, the Flight Attendants, and the QRH, we determined it was safe to return to the gate. We parked at Gate X without further incident. I support my Captain's decision to reject because I feel it was truly in the interest of safety.		Departing ZZZ Runway XX. Bleeds off takeoff. Flaps 1. Approximately 163,000 pounds takeoff weight. Surface temps in ZZZ around 30C. Winds 120@10G20. Aircraft was properly configured. Bleeds Off Takeoff QRH was referenced by the FO (First Officer) and I double checked it. Takeoff thrust was 101.2% N1 I believe. Takeoff roll was normal…100 knot call out was made. Just past the 100 knot call the FO called the Engine 2 Exceedance. Engine 2 EGT dial was completely RED which sits just below the N1 Dial. I made the decision to abort the takeoff at around 110 knots. Stopped halfway down the runway. Determined we could clear the runway and turned off at the High-Speed [Taxiway] 1. We asked for the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to be dispatched. They reported no damage, no brake fire. Completed the RTO (Rejected Takeoff) QRC/QRH. The Engine Limit or Surge or Stall QRH. Referenced the Brake Cooling Charts for a 900ER and determined we could taxi to the gate. Arrived at the gate with no further incident.I do understand that above 100 knots, we should reject for loss of directional control, Fire, Engine Failure, PWS (Predictive Wind Shear). However in the moment, with a relatively heavy airplane, max performance, and the long runway I believed at that time it was safer to stop the airplane. A different airport with a different set of conditions I am not certain I would have. Also seeing a completely red EGT gauge just below the N1 gauge does lead to a definite startle factor in what exactly I am I looking at. The fact that it was a long day which included defueling the airplane, about the start the push only to be told by Dispatch not to push because flights we are diverting out of ZZZ1. Deboarding, Customer Service issues, Multiple FAs (Flight Attendants) timing out, our own CCO (Critical Crew Offtime) issues which included extending our CCO time, reboarding, 5 Dispatch releases...Not 100% certain that is all relevant but maybe in my mind it was a factor in just saying maybe we should just call it and not take this plane airborne. I dunno. But at the end of the day we made that decision. Nothing was broke or bent, no one was hurt but it did give me a sleepless night and something to think about.		Flight Crew reported a rejected take off was caused by Engine #2 EGT exceedance and returned to the gate for maintenance action.

Then I felt a very slight buffeting and closed the throttles, and then got a  momentary ECAM, that cleared itself as rapidly as it appeared, so we were unable to determine what it was. The takeoff was rejected and we taxied clear of the runway on to Taxiway 1 facing west.  The Captain ran the engines up slightly and they responded normally, so we decided to try another takeoff.  Moments later we got an ECAM high fuel temperature on the left outboard fuel tank (62)c which required us to turnoff #1 generator and shutdown #1 engine.  Taxing back to the gate the Captain remarked that the #2 engine was very slow to respond to throttle input.  The Captain wrote up both the rejected takeoff due to sluggish engine response and the fuel temp issue.  The aircraft was taken out of service.Cause - Possibly the OAT which was 38c.		First officer takeoff RWY XL. We were cleared for takeoff, First Officer advanced the thrust levers to spool up and stabilize the engines before setting Flex thrust. Both engines were very slow spooling up and when they finally spooled up and stabilized we got a master caution. It came and disappeared immediately and unfortunately neither of us saw what it was and there was no record in the current leg ECAM report. We rejected the takeoff at a speed less than 10 knots and cleared the runway on the first available taxiway. Once we were stopped on the taxiway, I called maintenance and let them know what happened. While sitting on the taxiway we got a master warning for hot fuel, followed the ECAM and shut the number one engine down and returned to the gate.If the engines would have spooled up and stabilized faster, I believe there wouldn't have been an issue. Only suggestion is the flight crews need to be aware if the engines don't spool up in a timely fashion, it needs to be written up in the AML.		A320 flight crew reported executing two consecutive rejected takeoffs due to engine response issues during power up. The aircraft was taken out of service.

I set TO power and then took my hands off the thrust levers but [the Check Airmen] motioned for me to keep my hands on the thrust levers saying keep your hands on the thrust levers. A severe vibration developed at 80 kts. where upon I looked over to [the Check Airmen], but got no response. [The Check Airmen] did not respond by taking control of the thrust levers or side stick and did not say 'I have control' which I expected him to do. He did not enunciate a Go or No Go decision. The severe vibration presented uncertainty as to aircraft suitability for flight and having my hands still on the thrust levers I closed the thrust levers and the TO was rejected. It seems that [the Check Airmen] experienced a startle effect rendering him momentarily incapacitated leaving me in the absence to make a timely decision. [Company] SOP calls for the Pilot in Command (PIC) to keep his hands on the thrust levers once power is set for every take-off. His directive for me to keep the thrust levers was a violation of SOP. This caused confusion and a breakdown of crew coordination due to his CRM failure while in command which introduced a potential hazard. The cause of the vibration was determined to be a nose wheel shimmy by the check airman. He falsely accused me of having full side stick elevator down deflection claiming he saw this. If this were true then why didn't he say something sooner? I am still awaiting the data to see the actual side stick movements. The fact is that I had only applied slight down stick as Airbus recommends for the A-330. To continue a take-off while experiencing a severe vibration in the high speed regime could have introduced other potential emergencies such as if a nose wheel tire blew and flew off the nose gear? Then we would have had a real priority situation. What if that vibration didn't resolve and continued into the high speed regime? The take-off was rejected in the low speed regime at a safe speed.[The Check Airmen's] insistence on unusual procedures apart and in contravention to [company] A-330 procedures became a concern to me and seems to have the potential to introduce hazards. In addition and most concerning is his lack of crew coordination and lack of effective crew resource management skills. Later after the brakes had cooled for an hour [the Check Airmen] made the take-off. Upon block in to ZZZ1 two mechanics came forward to the cockpit to ask about the vibration and asked whether there was a write up in the log book. [The Check Airmen] was not in the cockpit so I referred them to him. When [the Check Airmen] returned to the cockpit, I mentioned the mechanics concerns and asked whether we needed a log book write up for the vibration and the reject but he did not respond with an answer. No log book write up was made and I do not know what was looked at other than the standard preflight checks. I have brought some of these concerns up to [another Captain] throughout OE as they were occurring. I have similar complaints from [four other people] who share the same experiences, verbal abuse and intimidation, non-standard procedures against SOP and nonstandard phraseology from [the Check Airmen]. All four of us have had the same or similar bad experiences in CRM and non-standard procedures enforced. All feel frustration from intimidation and very poor to nonexistent CRM. I sincerely suggest that all first officers mentioned be interviewed and surveyed concerning his check airman qualities, his verbal intimidation and abuse, his lack of responding to critical queries and teaching nonstandard procedures.		[Narrative contained no additional information.]		A330 Captain reported concerns over loss of crew coordination and situational awareness during a rejected take off event.

I flew while PM (Pilot Monitoring) ran the ECAM checklist. HYD Quantity was zero. Contacted Dispatch and informed them of the situation and requested runway data for Runway XXC and to have fire equipment and tug ready for our arrival. We determined that [requesting priority handling] with ATC would be helpful and the best course of action due to loss of steering and some of the brake functions along with 1 thrust reverser, as well as possibility of fire from all the fluid loss. I called FA (Flight Attendant) with a briefing of situation and informed her would be a normal landing with some precautions. I informed passengers of same. We requested a 20 mile final so we had extra time for slower flaps and manual gear extension. We slowed to 210 kts. and configured aircraft around 4,000 feet. Normal landing and slowed to safe taxi speed and made [Taxiway] 1 turnoff with differential braking and rudder. Stopped aircraft, set brakes and communicated with fire rescue. No issues, tug was at our aircraft in a few minutes to pull us back to gate after completing tow in checklist after starting APU and shutting down engines.		On descent into ZZZ approximately near ZZZZZ at FL320 we received an ECAM HYD G RSVR LO LVL. Captain continued flying while I ran the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor). HYD System Quantity showed near zero. After ECAM was complete I went into the FM (Flight Manual) to complete checklist. Captain called Dispatch and had them run landing distance for Runway XXC. [Priority handling was requested] due to manual gear extension/Hyd fluid gone (unsure where it leaked, possible fire) and no nose wheel steering along w no normal brakes. Captain briefed FAs (Flight Attendants) and briefed passengers. We requested 20 mile final due slower configuration and manual gear extension. We slowed to 210 knots and configured with gear at 4,000 feet. Normal landing and we were at a slow taxi speed near [Taxiway] 1 and the Captain was able to clear runway with braking. Stopped, coordinated with fire/rescue. No issues, tug was right there. We had started the APU and shut down engines and ran tow-in checklist. Plane towed to gate without incident. ZZZ did a great job coordinating with tug team/fire rescue etc. Ended up 12 mins early.		A320 flight crew reported loss of Green Hydraulic System fluid in flight. The flight Crew requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing at destination airport.

They ran the ECL checklists and at a natural break in the action called me to inform me of the event, according to our pre-break briefing. I came to cockpit and then they ran through the ECL/QRH again reviewing their action bringing me into the loop and up to speed. I then called Dispatcher via SAT phone requesting a conversation with him and Maintenance Controller. We observed only shattered outer glass pane, inner acrylic intact and stable. Maintenance reviewed our situation and then we formed our plan. We discussed (pilots, Dispatch and Maintenance) decided the situation was stable and proceeding to destination as flight planned was best option. We maintained FL340, informed ATC of situation with requested FL340 to destination. My FO and Relief Pilot followed the pre-break briefing by working the problem using the ECL and their experience to stabilize the situation. They efficiently and effectively followed established procedures. I reviewed their work and then we all discussed and reviewed the situation. I decided, considering their input along with Dispatcher and Maintenance that the best/safe course of action was to leave the airplane stable and continue to destination. Landed uneventfully.				B777-200 Captain reported the First Officer's windscreen shattered during cruise at 34,000 feet.  After running the appropriate checklists and talking to Dispatch and Maintenance Control, the crew decided to continue to their destination.

Told them we would try and climb and see if the issue returned. Climbing through FL240 the noise returned but not as loud as prior event. After consulting with Dispatch/Maintenance, decision was made to divert to ZZZ. Diversion required fuel dump of an estimated 132,000 lbs. of fuel. Coordinated with ZZZ1 Center to dump fuel. Descended to FL200 and commenced fuel dump. Upon completion of fuel dump continued to ZZZ without further incident. Upon arrival in ZZZ, briefed Maintenance crew of the event. Upon inspection Maintenance found damage to the FO sliding window seal.				B777 Captain reported the First Officer's cockpit sliding window began to produce a loud noise on climb. The flight crew descended until the noise abated, then attempted to climb again.

I took a closer look at it and saw it was the wire in the top of the windshield glowing and pulsating from bright to dim and back continuously. I showed it to the FO (First Officer) and then the glowing traveled to the left burning wire. The glowing went out. About a second or 2 later the wire lit back up and had smoke coming out of it. Now it traveled to the right and down into the windshield and then glowing went out while simultaneously shattering the left windshield. At this point I stated, 'My Aircraft' and told the FO to [request priority handling] and tell them we need an immediate descent. After we started down ATC asked where we wanted to go and just having passed ZZZ we told them we wanted to go to ZZZ. They gave us vectors for ZZZ and the FO went into the QRH. We followed the QRH procedure and determined that it was the outer pane. At this point, after seeing the glowing wires and smoke in the cockpit I determined that the safest course of action was to get the plane on the ground. We landed in ZZZ without any further problems and were followed to the gate by the fire trucks. Everyone lived.I don't think there were any factors that played a role in this event other than maybe old wires. Putting new wires into the windshield heating systems may prevent this.		ZZZ1-ZZZ2. FL350 Cruise just past ZZZ. Noticed a flash of light out CA (Captain)'s front window. CA said he saw glow and smoke on upper windshield. CA said let's go to ZZZ. As we were preparing to divert CA's front windshield shattered along with more glowing from heating element. [Requested priority handling] with Center. Ran QRH for shattered windshield. Turned off L Window Heat as we suspected the heating element was failing. Ran Normal checklists for visual landing on XXR in ZZZ. Requested ARFF. Taxi to gate uneventful. L Window Heating element failure. Opinion only. Simply a mechanical failure.		Flight crew reported Captain's windshield shattered in cruise due to a malfunctioning windshield heat system. The flight crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

I have been working RDU flights all month and the first couple of times that I flew this approach I thought that it was my flying skill, but after having done this all month I can safely say that it is how the approach is built. When arriving into RDU, I have been requesting this approach via the HEAVE transition which dumps you off the ALDAN STAR onto the RNP approach course. The LNAV portion of this particular approach brings you in well left of runway centerline, so much so that if you do not make any corrections when crossing the threshold, the right mains will also touchdown well left of centerline. I have flown this approach several times this month in 800s, and two other aircraft types which leads me to believe that this is how the actual approach is built. I have triple checked the RNP values several times and the aircraft has always been performing within RNP requirements. I have also flown the RNP 23R and that approach works as it should. Nothing additional to include. Reevaluate the RNP 5L approach course.				Air Carrier Captain reported the RNP Runway 5 approach to RDU '...brings you in well left of runway centerline...'. The reporter has experienced this several times in different aircraft.

We accomplished the appropriate checklist. Contacted dispatch and the [flight operations] and determined that it was safe to continue the flight to ZZZ. Thanks to the [flight operations] inputs we also notified ZZZ1 center that we were non RVSM (due to no autopilot) and with their approval we were able to continue at FL340. On arrival into ZZZ we wrote up the malfunction. The avionics tech informed us that the aircraft had the same malfunction on DATE. The remedial action for that malfunction was to MEL both autopilots. Our Avionics tech was able to isolate that the fault was indeed in the A autopilot system and that the B would operate normally. After completing the appropriate documentation we continued our flight back to ZZZ2. Being able to consult with Dispatch and the [flight operations] was a force multiplier, it was the [flight operations] who remembered that our system failure would result in our no longer being able to be RVSM and our dispatcher was able to provide us with the information that if we had to descend from RVSM airspace we would still be able to complete the flight at the lower altitudes.I find it a bit concerning that there was a prior write up on DATE and they were unable to determine the system fault but instead just MEL'd both A/P's and sent it on its way. Our avionics tech was able to show us the message clearly showing that it was A/P A that was faulting and not B. The previous write up was at an outstation so there was probably time pressure involved to 'get the jet out' but if someone had taken a safety pause to run the appropriate check they would have isolated the fault instead of just MEL'ing the entire system. There was a moment of 'question' when operating the checklist. The first question statement 1) Is the stabilizer trimming? Yes, No. A point of discussion among us was that since we were in cruise and the air was calm we weren't sure if the stabilizer was or wasn't trimming? We eventually determined that by reducing airspeed there should be a change in stab trim. It was by doing this that we were able to determine that the trim was indeed not operating. I would recommend exploring the option of including a statement in step one to verify the trim operation before continuing to the next step. After working the problem from event to resolution on the ground and return to flight I am wondering as to the operation of the stab trim system and selected autopilots. Was this as it appears to be a case of A autopilot faulting but giving us the indication of a stab out of trim? If so then wouldn't changing to B autopilot have also cleared the fault such as the return to service MEL? Does there need to be a revisit to the Stabilizer out of trim checklist to address if it's an A/P fault as opposed to a Stab Trim?				B737-900 flight crew reported a stabilizer out of trim annunciation during cruise required a consult with company maintenance and continued onto the destination.

Airplane was a Routine Overnight (RON) from the previous flight. Upon arrival at report time, the cabin was being cooled by ground air and was comfortable. We started the APU shortly before departure time. Climb and cruise were normal. Passing 11,000 ft. on the descent, the FO (First Officer) and I both noticed a strong (4 out of 5) 'dirty sock' odor coming from the cockpit vents. I turned off PACK1 and the odor began to abate. I called the cabin to ask the Inflight Crew if they were experiencing the same in the cabin. They said they were not. Maintenance was requested during taxi in, PACK1 remained off. Upon inspection of the tail section, I saw fresh oil coming from the APU service door seams and drains. According to the logbook, the APU had been serviced after a 'LOW OIL' message three days earlier. The Contract Maintenance Technician opened the APU service doors and observed oil throughout the compartment, including on the breather port. When he opened the APU oil service point, he estimated that more than a quart of oil spilled out and the reservoir gauge still showed over-filled. Maintenance Control had the Technician run both packs for 15 minutes at a high temp setting to decontaminate the PACKs with the intention to put the APU on MEL and have us fly our return flight with passengers. Inflight were encouraged to leave the aircraft for this procedure. At the beginning of this procedure, the Maintenance Technician also smelled the odor and agreed that the system was contaminated. The FO and I decided that we would do a brief engine run of the #2 engine at the gate before we boarded crew and customers in case contamination of the environmental system was still a problem. PACK1 was turned on first and did not seem to still be contaminated. When PACK2 was turned on with PACK1 off, we both smelled a strong 'dirty sock' odor again. I turned PACK2 off after about 10 seconds and we advised the Maintenance Technician. Operations determined that the aircraft would be repositioned to a Maintenance station. We ferried the aircraft unpressurized to ZZZ1.				Air Carrier pilot reported a fume event during descent. After collaborating with maintenance and further troubleshooting it was decided to ferry the aircraft to a company maintenance base.

We ran the QRH which had us disconnect the auto pilot and try to see if the manual electric trim works and it did not so we were hand flying with manual trim for the rest of the approach. Being that it was a flight control issue we agreed to [request priority]. The landing was a flaps 15 landing with a 15 kt. additive due to the gusting conditions. On the approach air carrier was told to go around due to us overtaking them on final. The landing was at 165 kts. approach speed and we used max auto brakes. After exiting we sat on the taxiway and waited for the fire trucks to arrive at the instruction of ATC. Once arrived the fire trucks followed us to the gate with no further delay or issues.		During descent into ZZZ the Stab out of trim light was intermittent and then eventually came on and stayed on. The QRH was performed and then upon following the checklist the main electric trim was found INOP. The rest of the flight was flown manually with no auto pilot, no auto throttles and manual trim. A flaps 15 landing with Vref + 15 for the wind additives was flown and a landing was made with max auto brakes. The approach speed was 165 kts., the landing and landing roll out was uneventful. [Priority handling was requested] in the interest of safety. We were then instructed to hold our position once clear of the runway.

As we ran the checklist I received feedback from the number 1 and determined that the procedure was not helping. The [Flight Attendant] advised me the irritation was getting worse and the passengers were concerned. After informing ATC of our situation we were cleared to 10000 and continued running the Smoke/Fumes Removal procedure (QRH).

We then had an Integrated drive generator 1 oil temp high and we disconnected Integrated drive generator 1. The airplane was in alternate law with no autopilot or auto thrust. At this point we believed trying to land ASAP was the best decision. We requested Runway XX at ZZZ. We kept the Flight Attendants updated but let them know that a brace call was unnecessary and that it should be a normal landing. We landed and taxied in without incident.				A320 Captain reported a dual generator failure during descent and a subsequent diversion for landing.

SYS 2 worked normally. Referenced the FM and continued. At FL340, received 'CAB PR EXCESS ALT' ECAM with associated master warning. We flew the airplane, silenced the alarm and confirmed the [problem]. The Captain directed me to continue to fly the aircraft and we donned our masks and established comms. He got clearance to descend from ATC and I initiated our descent. The ECAM cleared and reappeared at least once during the descent. During the descent, the Captain let the flight attendants (FAs) know what was going on and they mentioned that the emergency lights came on but that the masks did not drop. We leveled at 10,000 ft. and elected to return back to ZZZ1 since the FAs reported that there were no injuries on board. I coordinated the return with ATC while the Captain informed the passengers of what had happened and communicated with Dispatch. On final at ZZZ1, we received a 'CAB PR LO DIFF' ECAM that cleared on its own after a few seconds. The Captain elected to land the aircraft since we had [priority] and we were overweight by about 5k lbs. We landed without incident and returned under our own power to the gate.				A320 First Officer reported an EICAS message warned of a malfunction with the #1 pressurization system during climb out. Later another warning regarding the pressurization system appeared. The pilots descended to a lower altitude and returned to the departure airport.

I was the Captain and pilot flying on the flight [to] BOS. Flight was uneventful until short final when the actual winds and the programmed winds began to differ greatly, causing an increased mini groundspeed (Airbus gust correction) of 150 kts. vs programmed approach speed of 139. This increased ground speed, light weight, gusty winds, and delayed power reduction because of speed required, caused a ballooned flare which floated the aircraft out of the touchdown zone. Additionally, Runway 27 is only 7000 ft., making the touchdown zone even more critical; therefore, I executed a go-around. There was a helicopter crossing departure end of 27, forcing an aggressive climb to 3000 ft. We were vectored back around for a second attempt at ILS 27; however, we were vectored 6 miles in trail of an A330 and given specific speeds that maintained that spacing on final. Due to winds of 340/13G19 and the 7000 ft. runway, the wake of the preceding A330 caused the aircraft to balloon and float out of a safe landing position again, forcing a second go-around from landing position. The go-around was uneventful; however, due to approaching reserve fuel levels, we elected to declare minimum fuel and requested vectors to Runway 33, to be more aligned with the prevailing winds and on the longer runway. Approach and landing were uneventful and we arrived at the gate with exactly 3,900 lbs. fuel, our reserve for that flight.		Two go arounds performed landing on Runway 27 BOS before a successful approach was conducted to 33L. Both go arounds were initiated below 50 ft., the first of which ground contact was made during the go around. I believe the primary cause for both go arounds to be an increased reference speed due to inaccurate wind reporting at BOS. Loaded winds were 340/13g19. Airplane mini gs pushed ref speed up to 150 kts. causing excess float. This in combination with wake turbulence from a heavy on second approach prevented us from making a safe landing during first 2 events. Min fuel was declared and during 3rd approach ATC gave us updated winds of (from memory) 340/27g35. Successful landing was made.		A320 flight crew reported executing two go-arounds at BOS in gusty wind conditions. The second go-around also involved a wake turbulence encounter.

She said multiple FAs and passengers smelled it, and passengers were concerned. We put on our oxygen masks, turned on Engine Anti-Ice, and shut off Pack 2 per COM. I [requested priority handling], got cleared direct to the FAF, and requested paramedics meet us at the gate in case anyone was feeling unwell. The FO (First Officer) called the lead FA back, and she said the smell stopped, so we took off our oxygen masks. There was never any smell in the cockpit. The FO coordinated with Operations to ensure we had an open gate, and advised Dispatch via ACARS. Everything was in place to allow us to park immediately and deplane normally. I requested the ground crew not connect the air conditioning. Paramedics and Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting boarded the aircraft, but no one requested medical assistance. After all the passengers were off, the whole crew debriefed with Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting and local Maintenance. At this time, the FAs said there was a passenger who took their shoes off. They said it was possible this may have been the source of the smell, but they weren't sure. They said the smell was pervasive in the cabin, but did not seem to be coming from the air vents.I wrote up a discrepancy in the logbook and filled out a Cabin Odor Reporting Sheet. I called Maintenance Control, Dispatch, and the Chief Pilot to report the event.				Air carrier Captain reported being notified by the lead Flight Attendant of a fume event during descent.

I was the PM (Pilot Monitoring) and told the number 2 FA (Flight Attendant) we would be returning for landing at ZZZ. I [advised ATC] with Tower. Tower told us to switch to Departure and I [requested priority handling] again with Departure. We were asked what altitude we would like, and continued the climb to 5000 ft. while turning to a downwind. I pulled out the QRC and began to read it which led me to the QRH. Seeing the length of the checklist and how close we were to landing, I used my Captain's judgement and emergency authority to put it away and concentrated on getting the jet back onto the ground. After putting away the checklist, I called the FA's to see how they were doing and told them we would be returning to ZZZ with ARFF standing by. After this I made a PA to the passengers telling them about the smoke in the cabin and that we would be returning to ZZZ with safety vehicles standing by. I then contacted Dispatch through ACARS and stated smoke in cabin and requesting ARFF. We were on base and I determined we needed to do an overweight landing, so I pulled out that checklist and had no time to run it because we were turning a 5 mile final. I told the PF (Pilot Flying) to land soft and I would be writing down the V/S, airspeed and weight. After taking care of everything we ran the Before Landing Checklist while on final and had everything completed before our stable call at 1000 ft. When we landed we rolled onto a taxiway and stopped. After stopping I informed the passengers we would be inspected by the safety vehicles, followed by going to the gate. When ARFF arrived, they determined we were clear and had no heat coming off the jet. They followed us to the gate and boarded the plane after we parked. They gave us the clear that we were safe to deplane, however, by the time they got on the plane the electrical smell and smoke had dissipated. I wrote up the airplane and overweight landing protocols from the FOM.Having smoke in the cabin as an only indication, I didn't know If we had a fire or just smoke from a bleed system. I know how dangerous these fumes can be so that is why I elected to return as fast as possible and did not hold to finish up any checklist. These are times when you have to use good judgement and captain's authority.				Air carrier Captain reported a smoke event in the aft galley during initial climb. Flight crew returned to the departure airport and completed a safe landing.

They reported that multiple passengers were asking about it and reported some passengers with burning eyes. We immediately [advised ATC] and requested vectors back to ZZZ1. The First Officer took over flying duties and I continued communications with the flight attendants. They reported a haze in the cabin along with the smell, reported as sulfuric and burning plastic. The odor and smoke seemed to be getting worse so we decided to go to ZZZ as we felt like the situation was getting more severe and ZZZ was closer. We ran the Smoke, Fire, Fumes QRC checklist, then followed with the Smoke, Fire, Fumes QRH procedure. We stopped the QRH procedure as the smoke and fumes appeared to dissipate. We landed in ZZZ and pulled off of the runway and had the ARFF crew do a visual exterior inspection. We then proceeded to the gate. The ARFF did an interior inspection looking for any hot spots. None were found. No maintenance was available in ZZZ at the time of our arrival.				Air carrier Captain reported being notified by a Flight Attendant of burning odor in the cabin.

They said it was stronger in the back then in the front. I asked them if they observed any other characteristics, such as smoke or fumes, and if they were currently having any physiological effects. They said no to both questions. I said to please keep me informed if anything should change. This occurred within approximately twenty miles of the top of descent. All engine and flight instrumentation was normal. The First Officer and I did not smell the odor at this time, but per FOM guidance, continued to monitor the situation. We requested an early descent and requested our planned approach into ZZZ, the RNP [Runway] XX as soon as possible. During the descent I called the Flight Attendants back to ask if the situation had changed, and they said all was the same except that the odor seemed to be getting stronger but that it was hard to tell. We (pilots) still could not smell it at this time, and we continued with the approach and decided it was best to get the aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. The rest of the approach was uneventful. We landed straight in on Runway XX. After landing, decelerating through approximately 60 knots, the Master Caution and associated ELEC amber light on the overhead panel illuminated. At this point in time we still did not smell the odor. After parking the jet and shutting down the aircraft, the First Officer and I then almost immediately smelled an out of place smell. We immediately opened the windows, conducted the shutdown checklist and then I proceeded to the cabin to investigate further. After opening the flight deck door, I was met with a strong order smell from the cabin.The Flight Attendants handed me a cabin air quality reporting form. In that form, they observed the odor coming from the forward/mid/aft cabin and galleys. They described the smell as exhaust & fuel in nature, with a moderate intensity. It was at cruise flight and was noted at XA:10. Symptoms reported were a slight headache and sore throat, reported by the B and C positioned Flight Attendants. The physiological effects noted were not previously known until I physically received the report.Maintenance met the aircraft, and I immediately began to brief them. After a quick detailed explanation, the mechanic advised that everyone needed to be off the plane. The rear doors, along with the R1 door were opened for ventilation. The Flight Attendants deplaned after all the passengers, and we as crew debriefed the event in the jetway for approximately 15 minutes. While we followed FOM guidance closely, I do feel that I could have been more detailed on my maintenance logbook right up. I did speak with Maintenance prior to the write up, but given the vague nature of this situation, more detail would have been helpful.Based on the illumination of the ELEC light, and after consultation with maintenance, it appears the cause of the odor was in issue within the DC electrical or standby power system, though further investigation will be needed. This biggest lesson learned for me is just how insidious both electrical an odor events can be. Though I felt I worked through the issue properly, I do feel I could have been more prompt in my actions. In the future I will ask more pointed questions in a more prompt manner, which will allow us that much more time to take the appropriate actions. And while I feel that declaring an emergency was not needed in this case, it was clear to me that it could have quickly developed into one given different circumstances.				Air Carrier Captain reported being notified by a Flight Attendant of a 'gas station' odor in the cabin during cruise. Flight crew continued to destination where an AML discrepancy and fumes reports were submitted.

Our approaching to ZZZ Runway XX was normal. Vapp was approximately 135 kias and the aircraft was configured flaps FULL. At 1,000 ft. AGL the aircraft was stable and cleared to land and the Captain made that call referencing such. The aircraft touched down within the touchdown zone and the landing was smooth. Upon touchdown the Captain called 'Spoilers' and 'Reverse Green'. The aircraft landed with Auto brakes LO and I transitioned to manual brakes at approximately 100 kias. At approximately 90 kias I felt the aircraft jerk and yaw. My assumption was that a wheel had momentarily locked up. This jerk was just for a second and then the aircraft continued a normal deceleration on the centerline. The Captain called '70 Knots' and then assumed control of the aircraft. The Captain taxied off the runway at SG4 and all indications were normal with no unusual steering input or power required. After performing the after landing flow the Captain began to monitor the WHEEL page and noticed that brake #2 was increasing in temp out of line with the other brakes. Upon runway exit brake #1 was approx 210, brake #3 approx 150, and brake #4 approx 150. Brake #2 was 300 and climbing. Turning north on Taxiway SC approaching Runway XYL the #2 brake was climbing steadily to 400. The Captain told the FO that he suspected that we were dragging brake #2 and to contact OPS and request that maintenance meet the aircraft. ATC had us hold short of Runway XYL at SC and the cleared us across that closed runway and instructed us to hold short of Runway XYR at U. The Captain stopped short of XYR at U and set the parking brake confirming the triple indication and the ECAM and then turned the taxi light off.Almost immediately ATC stated 'Aircraft X your left main appears to be on fire.  The Captain hit the PA button and stated 'Flight Attendant Stations'. ATC stated that ARFF was en-route and then I asked if we needed to remain on the current frequency or to switch to a different. We were told to stay on our current frequency. The LEAD Flight Attendant (FA) called and asked if we needed to evacuate. The Captain told her not at this time, ARFF was responding, and that we would let her know. We got an ECAM regarding HYD pressure low but our attention was taken back to the ARFF response and the aircraft configuration. ATC reported Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) approaching and we could feel the impact of the water hitting the aircraft. We went back to the ECAM and noticed that all of the YELLOW HYD fluid was gone, our left side brakes were going, and our nose wheel steering was lost. We started the APU and shutdown both engines never turning on the yellow electric pump. ARFF reported that the fire was out but still smoking. The Captain hit the PA button and stated 'Flight Attendants, remain seated, remain seated, remain seated'. The Captain told ARFF that we would need to be towed in and confirmed that they would escort us to the gate.The Captain made a PA announcement informing the passengers of the brake issue, the subsequent fire, and that ARFF had extinguished the flames and that we would be towed to the gate with the escort. The Captain further asked them to be patient as we coordinated a tow to the gate. The FA called asking if passengers could use the LAV.  The Captain allowed them but reiterated once a tug showed up they would need to be seated. While waiting for the tow The Captain sent a message via ACARS to Dispatch and Maintenance informing them of our situation. We coordinated with Airline Operations, ZZZ Operations, and ATC for the tow. Once connected we confirmed with ATC that the aircraft movement was now under control of ZZZ Operations and that they would coordinate clearance across XYR and to the gate. At the gate The Captain set the brake, turned off the beacon, and confirmed that we were chocked before releasing the parkingbrake and turning off the seat belt sign. At the parking check list we noticed the FAULT lights on the PTU and the Y ELEC PUMP. The Captain turned them both off in accordance with the ECAM and finished the checklist. The passengers deplaned via normal procedures. The Captain then contacted the Chief Pilot of Duty. The Captain was instructed to make phone calls to Airline Operation and ZZZ Tower to provide additional information.		[Narrative contained no additional information.]		A320 First Officer reported after landing they had a brake overheat and a fire in the brake area of the number 2 brake.

We followed MEL procedures for low power settings in descent. Descent into ZZZ at FL245, we started getting the altimeter flashing amber (wanting local altimeter setting). Both Captain and I checked the FMC, and programming was correct. We continued descent and set local altimeter at FL180. We were a little task saturated with getting ready for approach, moderate turbulence flying through buildups, unable to deviate due to traffic, TCAS TA , and it was getting a little hard to hear in the cabin. At approximately 8 ft. 500 MSL, we get an ECAM (CAB PR LO DIFF PR...A/C V/S REDUCE). The aircraft was only doing approximately 1,300 FPM descent. Looking at the pressurization page, we see the outflow valve amber and fully open. FMC was correct with destination and data in approach PERF page. Since we were below 10,000 ft. MSL and about to land, we continued to the field and landed uneventfully. No one in the back knew of the issue as masks did not drop.We were scheduled to take this aircraft from ZZZ to ZZZ2. Maintenance performed checks, and all their tests passed and was going to put the aircraft in service. The Captain was not comfortable taking the aircraft as maintenance could not find a reason as to why the outflow valve fully opened. Captain refused the aircraft and I concur with his rationalization. The #2 HP Valve Inoperative would not have caused the issue, and given that we had a flashing amber altimeter on the PFD at FL 245, it did not feel right taking the aircraft with a plane load of passengers not knowing the cause.Subsequently, we flew the aircraft to ZZZ3 at 10,000 ft. MSL and prior to taking off we had a PACK 2 failure which we had to have deferred.				A320 First Officer reported aircraft cabin altitude began to descend ahead of depressurization schedule on initial descent. The flight crew continued on programmed descent and and a normal landing at destination airport. The flight crew made a log book entry and maintenance ran their checks and signed the aircraft off. The Captain refused the aircraft after disagreeing with the maintenance actions.

I was PM (Pilot Monitoring) and did not have the traffic ahead of us in sight. Shortly after crossing CNRSE, with the autopilot on, we hit the wake turbulence from the aircraft we were following. It rolled us violently, gave us a roll alert on the PFD and put the autopilot into CWS. I immediately asked who we were following and was told a 757. The autopilot was no longer following the RNAV course and descent profile. My FO (First Officer) clicked off the AP and FD and began correcting the course and path, the path was very challenging because of the crosswind and the continued rumbles of wake turbulence from the aircraft we were following. We ended up slightly high going through 1,000 ft., but we were in a position to safely land. We did have a brief high descent rate caused by a wind gust and my FO correcting. We landed safely in the touchdown zone and taxied to the gate uneventfully. With all that being said I should have called the go around early, when we realized how badly the wake turbulence had [affected] our path. I allowed myself to be caught up in the 'we can fix it' mind set, which was wrong. The next time I run into a situation similar to this we will go around.Having a better idea of what aircraft you're following so you can try and predict wake turbulence.

The takeoff, climb, cruise, and descent went as expected. During the Descent to Approach phase, we did receive a Master Caution Light for the YAW DAMPER. The Captain ran the QRH and the resolution was to not exceed Flaps 30; End of Checklist. During the approach phase on a visual for Runway XXL, we join the localizer for XXL at ZZZZZ. I was the pilot flying (PF) so I called for 'Flaps 1' to begin to slow back to 210 kts. We had the proceeding aircraft insight and the field, so we called both 'in-sight' to ATC. We got cleared for the visual XXL following traffic and were instructed to slow back to '170 kts.' to a 5 NM Final. Given the heavy traffic congestion that night going into ZZZ1 and the proceeding traffic in-front of us, I continued to call for FLAPs 5, then Gear Down with Flaps 15, then eventually Flaps 25. The Captain mentioned that I was going too fast for Flaps 25. That's when we both noticed the Amber Ban on the Airspeed indicator was greater than our bugged speeds. At that same moment we both noticed our flaps never extended out of Flaps UP which explains why we had a hard time slowing down. We both determined we needed to Go-Around. We were instructed to turn left heading 250 and maintain 4,000. We executed the missed approach procedure and reconfigured the airplane to level flight. I turned on the Autopilot and kept my speed around 210 kts. Not having too much fuel onboard (had around 6,000 pounds of fuel) I didn't want to get too far away from the airport as we were problem solving the flap issue. Once reaching clean configuration, the Captain gave me the airplane and he ran the QRH to determine what the problem was. Talking with ATC, I knew we had some sort of FLAP Malfunction and told him we will need Runway XXR. I started to set up the aircraft for the ILS XXR. After a few short vectors, the Captain determined we should plan for a FLAPS UP landing. We gathered FLAPS UP landing numbers and re-bugged the aircraft. The approach and landing went as planned. We touchdown and exited around Taxiway 1 in ZZZ1 where we had the fire trucks waiting for us. We had the fire trucks follow us into the ramp area to make sure everything looked good on the airplane. After entering the ramp area and executing the after landing check, everything looked normal to us. We asked the ramp to [for] the fire trucks to be waived off. We arrived at the gate and completed our post flight duties and then contacted Dispatch and the Duty Pilot.		To my recollection these are the pertinent details as to the event my crew and I experienced on the night ZZZ2-ZZZ1. During decent we got a master caution flight control. The yaw dampener had disengaged. I referenced the QRH and followed the steps to resolution. We continued the descent for a visual approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ1. We were vectored behind traffic to follow which appeared to us both was very close and decided we needed to configure and slow down for spacing. We began that process but I feel my concern for our relative proximity to our traffic to follow led me to not verify that the selected flaps were in the correct position. At some point I noticed the speed tapes on my display did not look right. Initially I considered an unreliable airspeed situation but cross check of all the available indications made me realize that the flaps had not moved to their selected position. The indication was they hadn't moved at all. I then instructed my First Officer (FO) to accelerate to clean maneuver speed and start a gentle missed approach. Which he did. ATC gave us a heading and altitude to maintain and when we were stable I asked my FO to maintain aircraft control while I tried to decipher the problem. I attempted to contact Maintenance and Dispatch but the radio chatter between Operations and other aircraft impeded that process. Even with years of experience and high quality training I failed to find the proper checklist. At that point considering where we were and the conditions at ZZZ1 that I would pull data for a no flap landing on Runway XXR. The data was very favorable so I decided to use my Captain's authority to take that course of action. We briefed the new plan and associated threats. We set up for and requested to land on XXR. At 500 ft. we got a ground proximity warning because of our flap position and inhibited it because we knew why. If I had found the proper checklist that step would have been accomplished. Landing at that point was assured and all other items for landing were reconfirmed. The FO executed a successful no flap landing and we taxied clear of the runway and to our gate. After the shutdown checklist we debriefed the event. I realized then that the flaps disagree checklist would have diagnosed the problem and led us to use alternate flaps. We then would've been properly configured and completed the landing checklist correctly. I know I failed to find the proper course of action and am very disappointed at myself. However, after deciding on the course of action that we took I had full confidence in a favorable outcome with a safe landing.		B737 flight crew reported a yaw damper fail message and flap malfunction while on approach. The crew broke off the approach, ran checklists, and configured the aircraft for a successful landing.

I was acting as the Pilot Flying on this flight. Pre-flight, gate departure and taxi out were all normal with no anomalies. Departing Runway XX, the take-off roll, rotation and initial climb out were uneventful. At approximately 600-800 ft. AGL, after gear retraction but prior to any flap retraction, the flight deck phone chimed from the cabin. The Pilot Monitoring answered the call to hear FA (Flight Attendant) number four reporting smoke in the aft cabin that was increasing and causing his eyes to water and throat to burn. The FA was notified that we would return to ZZZ and asked to report any changes to the situation. The CA (Captain), Pilot Monitoring, advised me of the situation and of our need to return to ZZZ. At that time [we requested priority handling] with the Tower Controller who acknowledged the [priority] and handed us off to Departure. During this phase of flight the Pilot Monitoring communicated with the cabin crew and the passengers of our need to return to ZZZ for a precautionary landing. I communicated with ATC and flew the aircraft on vectors around to Runway XY. The Pilot Monitoring executed the QRC checklist for Smoke Odor Fumes and continued into the QRH to the extent time allowed. The same was accomplished with the Overweight Landing procedure. I landed the aircraft on Runway XY in a Flaps 30 Autobrakes 3 configuration with a normal touchdown and rollout. We exited the runway where we were met by and immediately put in contact with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) Personnel. They did a visual inspection along with temperature readings and reported no anomalies. The cabin crew reported the dissipation of smoke at that time as well. In coordination with ARFF they escorted us to [Spot] XX where they asked us to have passengers remain seated while they boarded the aircraft for an inspection. After doing so, they reported it was safe to deboard the aircraft which occurred normally. Maintenance took the aircraft from that point after AML entries were made by the CA. We received a new aircraft, reboarded and flew the original ZZZ-ZZZ1 trip with no abnormalities. In light of the unknown source of the smoke, emphasis was placed on returning to ZZZ in an expeditious but safe manner over completing all QRH items for [the] event. Nothing to suggest.				Air Carrier First Officer reported being notified by a Flight Attendant of smoke in the aft cabin during initial climb. Flight crew immediately requested priority handling for an air return where a safe landing was executed. Airport support personnel met and escorted flight to parking gate.

I was the Pilot Flying and the First Officer (FO) was the Pilot Monitoring. We heard a light 'bang' noise, followed by instrument indications of a left engine failure and slight to no airframe vibrations. We requested priority handling with ATC, discussed best airfield to divert to (we chose ZZZ3; about 50-60 NM away), and started receiving vectors and altitude changes for the descent to ZZZ3. The FO flew the aircraft and talked on the radio while I ran the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) checklists for an engine failure. After all checklists were complete, I took the controls and performed a single engine landing to a full stop on Runway XXC at ZZZ3. The CFR personnel/equipment inspected the aircraft and stated all looked good. We then taxied to gate B14.		Flight was cruising at FL360. We had chosen to fly west of some weather that was along the east coast. As we were just passing the ZZZ4 state line, talking to ZZZ Center, we heard a thud type noise from the left side of the plane. The engine instruments for the left engine started to show that the engine was failing. Shortly thereafter the plane yawed due to the engine failure. The Captain, who was pilot flying, immediately said 'My aircraft' and I replied 'your aircraft'. The autothrottles and autopilot were disconnected and the Captain initiated a descent while I requested priority handling with ZZZ Center. We had both agreed that from our current position that diverting to ZZZ3 would be best so I then told ATC our intentions of diverting there. I reached for the Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) to start a checklist as we were descending while getting altitudes and vectors from ATC got us headed towards ZZZ3. The QRC didn't have engine failure checklist so I went to the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). As I got into section 7 of the QRH I asked the Captain if he'd like to run the procedure for engine failure. He then gave a positive exchange of controls to me saying 'your aircraft' and I replied 'my aircraft'. I kept the aircraft descending while the Captain ran the QRH. We continued to receive vectors and altitudes from ATC getting us into position for an approach into ZZZ3. As we approached ~13000 feet the Captain had finished all QRH driven items and checklists so I then positive exchange of controls back to him. At this point we were getting vectors and altitudes from ZZZ3 Approach and was expecting the ILS to XXC. As the Captain flew I/we briefed the approach and talked about once we got on the ground coming to a full stop and extending the flaps all the way from 15 to 40 as a precaution. We also discussed the overweight landing and what needed to be done in regard to that. We continued to descend until we were cleared for the ILS XXC approach. As we were intercepting the localizer I ran the descent checklist and before landing checklist to the line. We captured the glide slope and continued to configure the aircraft for a single engine approach while finishing the before landing checklist. The approach went smoothly and so was the landing. Once on the ground we came to a full stop. The Captain set the parking brake, I set the flaps to 40 and he got the spoilers/boards. We had the fire trucks do an inspection of the aircraft and once cleared we were able to taxi to the gate under our own power. Once safely at the gate we ran the shutdown checklist with no further issues.		B737-800 flight crew reported left engine failure at cruise. The flight crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

I asked what it smelled like and if they could figure out the location. They could not and on the flight deck only smelled it faintly after several minutes. By the time we smelled it in the flight deck the Flight Attendants called back and said it was gone. Over the next several minutes we discussed what we thought it smelled like and I began to look up ZZZZZ frequency so I could give the company a heads up. Before I could make the call we received a call from the Flight Attendants letting us know the smell came back and were in the process of trying to locate the origin. I again asked them what they thought it smelled like and at that point, it became very pronounced on the flight deck. It was a strong burning plastic mixed with an electrical odor. At that point we performed immediate action items for smoke, fire, fumes by donning our masks and establishing communication. The FO (First Officer) took over the radios while I continued with the checklist and called the Flight Attendants. The FO told ATC we needed lower. He informed them we had smoke on the flight deck and [requested priority handling]. Shortly after I informed ATC it was actually fumes on the flight deck not smoke. At first he asked for vectors to ZZZ but after getting the weather we decided ZZZ1 was a better option. I continued with as much of the checklist as I could. I called the Flight Attendants to let them know we would be on the ground in less then 10 minutes and made an announcement to the passengers. A landing was performed in ZZZ1 on Runway XX. We stopped on the runway and had the fire trucks do a visual inspection. They saw nothing out of the ordinary. We taxied to the gate.		At FL390, FA's (Flight Attendants) called the Captain and said they could smell something burning in the cabin. A short while later, we could smell it in the cockpit as well. We completed the Memory Action Items for smoke/fumes. After a short time, the FA's said the smell was dissipating and going away. We looked through the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) procedure, but don't believe we did anything beyond the Memory Action Items since the situation had stopped. The Captain and I briefly discussed what our plan would be should we encounter it again, and within a few minutes the FA's called back and said the smell had returned. We ran the QRH, [requested priority handling], and made an uneventful landing in ZZZ.		B737 flight crew reported a fume event during cruise which was described as a 'burning odor'. Flight crew ran the QRH and diverted to an airport where a safe landing was executed.

After flap retraction was complete departing ZZZ2 (flaps indicated fully retracted, LE Flap Transit light out), the LE Flap Transit light came back on, accompanied by the green fully extended indication for the #4 Leading Edge Flap segment. The First Officer (FO) continued to fly, and I ran the Leading Edge Flaps Transit checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). We followed the checklist, which directs you to cycle flaps to 1, and back to off. This step did not clear the malfunction. The checklist directs a flaps 15 landing, and calls for a Non-Normal configuration landing distance. Since we had run the QRH, and were computing a non-normal landing distance, we decided to divert to ZZZ1 vs. returning to ZZZ2 or continuing on to ZZZ3. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ (QRH + Non-normal landing made this seem like the right choice). They put us on the ZZZZZ arrival for the ILS Runway X. Descent, approach, and landing were uneventful. I had the FO land the aircraft. Aircraft configuration was normal for a landing. We lowered the landing gear about 1/2 way to ZZZ1 to reduce landing weight, about 155000 lbs. at take-off. I referenced the Overweight Landing checklist, and computed landing distance about 6000 ft. at 150000 lbs. landing weight. Actual landing weight was 149000 lbs., touchdown was normal. I made MEL entries for the flap malfunction and the overweight landing. I had coordinated the diversion with Dispatch via ACARS during the flight, and I called to discuss the event after landing to include the overweight landing. We changed aircraft and continued on to ZZZ3.Weather at ZZZ2 was heavy rain, wet runway, braking action medium on arrival. Based on the ZZZ2 weather, we had pre briefed using ZZZ1 as our recovery base for a malfunction on take-off. ZZZ1 had been our alternate for the flight inbound to ZZZ2, so we had relatively current ZZZ1 weather and NOTAMs available. Two procedural suggestions for the QRH as posted. Need to be able to access this document without entering any passwords or login information, period. Company asking for a login when you NEED the QRH is decidedly not helpful. A more easily usable 'page back' function would be extremely helpful in the aircraft. The small arrow prompt in the bottom corner of the page is not very user friendly.				B737-800 Captain reported a flap malfunction and divert to land at the nearest suitable airport. The reporter also stated the software app to access the QRH is burdensome.

Within this, the takeoff reference speeds, as well as stabilizer trim and reduced thrust setting were all confirmed per the FOM. (Note, they had dropped out once before). We were then given an ATC reroute while taxiing, for a different fix beginning after the SID, which was sent by CPDLC. The change was loaded into the FMC via CPDLC upload. We even noted, that there was no checklist for such change, since this was no change to any ORCA segment nor a runway change. On takeoff roll, after the 100 kt. callout, I first noticed that there were no reference speeds on the speed tape, only the MCP bugged V2 value and the L/D speed for both current flap and next flap setting. I quickly grabbed the take off data sheet next to me, and called out, 'V1,' and 'ROTATE,' on time.		During takeoff roll, after 100 kt. call, realized no Vr V1 reference speeds on PFDs. FO (First Officer) (PM (Pilot Monitoring)) referenced takeoff data and called out V1, VR and takeoff completed normally.		B777 flight crew reported during the takeoff roll the PDF speed tapes were missing V1 and Vr. The First Officer quickly gave an audible to the Captain, announcing the missing speeds.

APU Bleed Air and Pack 1 were turned off. The smell dissipated. There were no previous logbook write-ups for similar issues. While performing the walkaround I noticed the PC Air was hooked up, and we continued to use that for cabin climate control. The FO (First Officer) and I discussed the odor issue and company protocol. We elected to minimize use of the APU and continued our [preparation].We experienced a strong foul odor during takeoff and climb. We referenced the FOM and FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) 2 odor isolation guidance. I selected PACK 1 off and closed the crossbleed valve as per the procedure.As time went on, I continued to smell the odor, though not as strong as the takeoff and initial climb. Following a restroom break, I returned to the flight deck and the smell was very apparent. The FO (First Officer) and I discussed our condition, options and symptoms, and [queried] the cabin crew. We decided it was safe to continue to our destination. The aircraft was written up for cabin odors and ZZZ Tech Ops met the aircraft on arrival.				A320 Captain reported a fumes event during takeoff. Flight crew followed appropriate procedures which resulted in the odor to dissipate enough to continue to destination where Maintenance was requested.

He asked me to submit a report for data collection purposes. Shortly after an on-time takeoff from ZZZ Runway XXR (about 6,000 feet MSL, while climbing out and bound for ZZZ1, we were advised by Departure Control that a (Company) aircrew from a flight behind us wanted to alert us that we had been venting a very large amount of fuel from our right wing fuel vent, from about the beginning of takeoff roll, and that it had continued for as long as the crew could observe us. My First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) visually confirmed this, stressing that we were indeed venting a lot of fuel. We had heard part of the aircrew's transmission before being advised we were the subject of discussion, and we recalled that the reporting crew sounded calm and professional, but clearly considered it urgent that we understood we were venting fuel at an uncommonly high rate. When flight deck duties permitted, FO (First Officer) used his cell phone to video the venting fuel so I could see it, too. I agreed that it was abnormal, and we coordinated with ATC to level off at 10,000 feet MSL to assess our situation and make a game plan. The high rate of fuel venting appeared unaffected by my power reduction during the level-off at 10,000 feet and would ultimately continue to vent at the same high rate until our center fuel tank was completely empty (over an hour later). There is no checklist for this anomaly, as there was no fuel imbalance (full wing tanks and about 10,000 pounds center tank fuel), and the circumstances did not meet the conditions to qualify as a fuel leak. My FO and I agreed not to proceed to ZZZ1 with an undiagnosed fuel issue while appearing to be jettisoning more fuel that we could afford to lose over the course of an approximately three hour flight. We advised ATC that we still had fuel venting and that we did not need to declare anything, but that we would require holding while formulating a game plan for return to ZZZ. We advised our F/As (First Officer), Dispatch and passengers of the situation and calmly explained to everyone that the venting fuel was the result of a normal aircraft fuel venting function that was simply working overtime for reasons unknown to us.While being vectored and awaiting holding, I noted the current total fuel quantity, kept the power (i.e., engine fuel flow) near constant, hacked the clock and determined how much time it took to burn 1,000 pounds of fuel so we could then subtract what the engines burned in that time frame from the total decrease in fuel quantity, then calculate the approximate rate of venting fuel, which we determined to be about 750 pounds per hour. We accepted holding at the ZZZZZ fix at 8,000 feet, which I considered high enough (above 5,000 feet AGL for fuel dissipation above the ground) and low enough for burning gas quickly, which we did with landing gear down and Flaps 5 after entering holding. We decided to burn fuel down to the new (146,300 pounds) -800 maximum landing weight before considering returning to ZZZ for landing. I was aware that an overweight landing is acceptable if landing data supports it, but I was not willing to consider doing so with the fuel still venting, as we felt we had to assume the fuel would still be venting during landing and taxi (I did not favor the risk of venting warm fuel on very hot concrete after stopping with brakes warmer than necessary from landing overweight). As it happened, the venting stopped immediately when center tank fuel was depleted, which coincided with our total weight being right at the new max landing weight. We then departed holding and landed uneventfully on Runway XX. We never declared anything, but we advised Approach we'd like the Fire Department to look us over after clearing the runway. They did so and observed no problems with our aircraft. I cleared them off, but they then asked if one of them couldfollow us to the gate, which we allowed. Block time was just under two hours. I debriefed by phone with Dispatch/Chief Pilot/Maintenance, put the write up in the logbook, debriefed with local Maintenance and proceeded with my crew to our new gate to fly uneventfully to ZZZ1.				Captain reported observers informed the flight crew of a significant amount of fuel was seen venting from the aircraft on take off. The flight crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport after it was determined that all of the fuel in the center tank had vented overboard.

We accepted and were given an assigned heading after ZZZZZ1, which we complied with.Additionally, we were given clearance to descend to 6,000 ft. and slow to 170 kts., which was complied with.Following an assigned heading of 180, approached verified we had the airport in sight and cleared us via a visual approach to Runway XX. Approach Control additionally cautioned us about flying behind a 'heavy' jet that was on final approach to Runway XYL. The caution was noted.Approach cleared us to continue our descent to 3,000 ft. before clearing the flight for a visual approach. The flight path proceeded with a dog leg Just prior to ZZZZZ2, the captain asked for 1,500 ft. to be selected on the MCP to comply with the altitude at ZZZZZ3 as he continued the descent. We received a resolution advisory (RA) 'Monitor vertical speed' as we noticed a high-wing Cessna orbiting at about 1,500. There was no ATC warning of an orbiting aircraft on the final approach at 1,500, which was outside the Class B Airspace.Flight Company XXXX descent below 2,000 ft. also brought the aircraft below the Class B tier just east of ZZZZZ2.The Captain complied with the RA as it continued with 'Maintain vertical speed', until we received the 'Clear of Conflict' aural alert.Glancing down to my Map display, the Cessna was pegged at 300 ft. below our altitude.We promptly notified approach control about the RA and the Cessna traffic.The flight continued to land and park without further incident.		While descending on a visual approach to Runway XX we were descending to 1500 ft. and there was a light single engine aircraft operating below the Class B airspace at approximately 1500 ft. We were not advised by ATC of said aircraft before we received a TCAS TA. Then TCAS RA told us to level off and we avoided the light single aircraft by approximately 300 ft. I inadvertently descended too early and subsequently exited Class B airspace.		Air carrier flight crew reported a NMAC with another aircraft on approach.

After getting take-off clearance, we lined up on the runway once cleared for take-off. I was lined up slightly off center of the runway and the tiller was neutralized. I felt confident in my ability to get repositioned perfectly on centerline. I held the brakes for the noise abatement take-off procedure. I applied power to 83% N1, then released the brakes as I simultaneously added the required take-off power. The aircraft swerved to the right then to the left so I rejected the take-off. Since we just barely started the take-off roll, it was a benign event. The airspeed was approximately 48 knots and the N1's were spooling up just beyond 50%. I safely brought the aircraft to a stop. We notified Tower and were given taxi instructions to exit the runways to the right onto taxiway Juliet. No emergency was declared and no assistance was needed. We discussed which/if there was a Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) or checklist to run. We ran an After Landing Flow. Once on the taxiway, we analyzed the occurrence. The Pilot of the aircraft behind us reported there was smoke coming from our nose tire and it was angled. With that information, I decided it was unsafe to fly without an inspection. I called Dispatch and Maintenance Control while the First Officer (F/O) coordinated with ZZZ Ops to get a gate to return to. I made a PA to the passengers and talked to the Flight Attendants. A logbook entry was made stating the aircraft steering was unresponsive during the takeoff roll and returned to normal with the throttles retarded. We returned safely to the gate. I debriefed with both my F/O and the FAs. There were no injuries.I should have taken the few feet of runway in order to ensure the nose wheel was straight instead of relying on the physical neutral location of the tiller. Because it was a low speed benign event, I failed to follow all procedures of a rejected takeoff. This includes the announcement over the PA for passengers to remain seated and to run brake cooling data.		We had a normal taxi out. After getting take-off clearance, we lined up on the runway once cleared for takeoff. The Captain was performing the take-off per the noise abatement procedure. The Captain applied power to 83% N1, then released the brakes while simultaneously adding the required take-off power.

We discussed which/if there was a Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) or checklist to run. We ran an After Landing Flow. Once on the taxiway, we analyzed the occurrence. The Pilot of the aircraft behind us reported there was smoke coming from our nose tire and it was sideways during the take-off. With that information, we decided it was unsafe to fly without an inspection. The Captain called Dispatch and Maintenance Control while I coordinated with ZZZ Ops to get a gate to return to. The Captain made a PA to the Passengers and talked to the Flight Attendants. I began to run the brake cooling procedure, but was then distracted by ATC, and never completed the required task. We returned safely to the gate. The aircraft was taken out of service. After speaking with the Flight Attendants, they said nothing seemed abnormal in the back and the Passengers hadn't even noticed anything out of the ordinary. We failed to comply with the full rejected takeoff procedures by not running brake cooling. Even though it was a very slow speed reject the procedure still needs to be accomplished in its entirety.		B737-700 Captain and First Officer reported a rejected takeoff due to the inability to keep the aircraft on the center line. The crew was unclear if this was a mechanical failure or pilot error.

Autopilot limits were exceeded and it disconnected without input due to amber roll authority message. Upset call outs and procedures were used and executed. The entire event onset and recovery lasted about 6 seconds. Conditions during the event were VMC all the way to the ground with a few storms 100 miles east off the coastline. Tops of the weather estimated around FL300. The seat belt sign was off at the time of the event and the FA's (Flight Attendant) were completing first class and coach service. To that point in the flight, we had experienced no turbulence at all. When FA's checked in, I was told all passengers were all seated at the time of the event and they had spilled liquids in the galley. I waited to write up the event for maintenance till ZZZ due to guidelines they require and not being familiar with them. The question from ATC was about wake turbulence. However, at the time of the event, the only traffic was at FL350 about 30 miles ahead with quartering headwinds on the same track. I believed the event to be be unrelated as aircraft rolled abruptly left so quickly.		The Autopilot was on and flying in LNAV and VNAV. We started our climb from FL330 to FL370. Around FL342, the plane started to get turbulence. Then it rolled to the left. The autopilot kicked off and the bank went to 45 degrees. We started the upset recovery and got the plane back under control.		Air carrier B737NG flight crew reported encountering turbulence climbing through FL343 that resulted in an uncommanded bank angle of 45 degrees. Aircraft control was re-established using upset recovery procedures.

It was less than five seconds before we had O2 masks on. We established comms and then Captain began coordinating for lower altitude while I started a controlled descent based on the fact that the cabin altitude and cabin rate weren't pegged. While working through the QRC/QRH the pressurization stabilized while descending and we elected to level off at 26,000 feet instead of 19,000 feet, which was our clearance.With the cabin pressure returning to around 6,000 feet, we elected to stay on O2 for a little while longer to allow for faster recovery from hypoxia symptoms. Checked the weather in ZZZ (VMC) and confirmed fuel requirements and elected to continue to ZZZ basted on the time en route, fuel requirements and weather at the field. I had symptoms of hypoxia almost immediately, which included tingly skin, chest tightness, heavy arms, light headedness, and a sinus headache. Most symptoms subsided within 20-30 minutes, but the headache lasted for several hours. We landed without further incident at ZZZ.				B737-700 First Officer reported loss of cabin pressure control.

When the left throttle was reduced to idle, the L ENG OH message went away. We were between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 on the D track to ZZZ Airport. We [requested priority handling] and received clearance to descend to FL310 and then turn left and proceed directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We made a radio call on XXX.XX stating our position and our planned descent. The L ENG OH checklist came on again on the EICAS. We did the checklist again and this time, when the throttle was reduced to idle, the message did not disappear. We continued the checklist and shut down the left engine. We got clearance to FL200 and we flew directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We communicated with Dispatch, ZZZ Radio, the Flight Attendant's (FA) and made a PA to the passengers. We were given priority vectors to Runway XXR and landed uneventfully.  We taxied clear of the runway and had the Fire Chief look over the plane concentrating on the left engine. We then taxied to Gate XX and shut down.Cause: The L ENG Fire Loop has apparently been replaced 3 sequences prior to our flight. My guess is that it was not completed properly.Suggestions: I don't know how it could have been prevented, but I will say that the training we receive at recurrent is excellent. We performed very well as a team. We discussed things together before executing anything.		At cruise (FL370) as Pilot Monitoring (PM) after coming up from my break about 2.5 - 3 hours into the flight we experienced an L ENG Overheat ICAS message. We followed the checklist and shutdown the #1 engine. We offset to the right of airway for a descent. This happened on [High Route] airway between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 way points. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Radio and were given clearance initially to FL310 then to FL200. We were cleared direct to ZZZ1 Airport for a single-engine approach and landing.Cause: This aircraft recently underwent maintenance for a left engine fire detector loop.Suggestions: Continue excellent pilot training in annual simulator events.		B777 Flight Crew reported an engine over temp indication resulted in engine shutdown and diversion.

We accomplished the immediate actions items for this event and I called for the checklist. While accomplishing the Cabin Altitude Checklist, we noted that the Cabin Altitude was continuing to rise to 10,000 ft., so I requested priority handling and directed the F/O (First Officer) to start an immediate descent. I informed ATC that we were starting this immediate descent to 10,000 ft. MSL. The Cabin Altitude started to decrease as we descended. After leveling off at 10,000 ft., I asked to proceed direct to ZZZ. After resetting our cruise altitude in the FMC, I saw that our arrival fuel was projected to be 7.5. I contacted Dispatch via ACARS to inform him of my plan to continue to ZZZ at 10,000 ft. I also contacted the Dispatcher on SATCOM. I informed the Flight Attendants of the pressurization problem during the descent. I contacted them again during cruise at 10,000 ft. to ask if the masks had dropped, and if any of the Passengers noticed anything strange to determine whether or not to make a PA. They told me the masks did not drop and none of the Passengers noticed anything, so I decided a PA was not warranted. We proceeded direct to ZZZ and landed with no further problems.There were several issues/mistakes which the FO and I discussed after the fact. We skipped the QRC and went straight to the QRH. We should have complied with the QRH step to activate the Passenger Oxygen System. Even though the cabin altitude was not climbing rapidly, the fact that I felt the need for an immediate descent to control Cabin Altitude means I did not feel the Cabin Altitude was under control. I should have considered stopping the descent before reaching 10,000 ft. when Cabin Altitude was within limits. We forgot to accomplish QRH deferred items. One additional note: We flew this aircraft from ZZZ2 to ZZZ1 at FL 320 without noticing a cabin altitude problem.				B737-700 Captain reported a Cabin Altitude Warning Horn and a Cabin Altitude of 9,500 feet in cruise. The Captain requested priority handling and directed the First Officer to descend to 10,000 feet. The flight crew elected to continue to destination airport at 10,000 feet and make a precautionary landing.

The aircraft banked to the right and we received a roll authority alert. As quickly as we started to manage the turbulence, the encounter had already ended. Prior to the turbulence event, we were in smooth air from the cruise phase of flight all the way through our descent. I asked the First Officer to call the flight attendants to make sure they were OK. Flight Attendant (FA) XX Stated he fell into a passenger seat and hit his arm on an overhead bin but said he was OK. The rest of the flight went smoothly without incident and after all the passengers deplaned, I debriefed the flight attendants and checked on their well being. During our debrief FA XX stated his arm was sore but thought he was alright. FA XY said she was thrown into her jump seat and that the turbulence was severe. The two remaining Flight Attendants were in the front of the aircraft and did not report being jostled or injured.				Air carrier Captain reported the aircraft encountered moderate to severe turbulence during arrival, resulting in a brief loss of control and a Flight Attendant being injured when they fell.

I assumed the proper personnel would come and close the doors prior to push. When we went to push we saw the EQUIP light was still on indicating the doors were still open. We called maintenance to come and secure the doors, when he arrived he closed the forward E & E door multiple times and the light remained illuminated. He determined it must be the sensor and decided we would defer the sensor. We reconnected the jet bridge and maintenance came on board and deferred the sensor. We followed the new MEL which instructed us to have ground personnel verify the doors are closed and locked. We pushed back and on takeoff could immediately feel the airplane was not properly pressurizing and confirmed on the overhead panel that the cabin pressure was climbing with our altitude. We leveled off at 5,000 [ft.] and told ATC we would likely be returning to ZZZ and would like vectors to give ourselves time to prepare. I was flying and the Captain gave me the radios and started working on checklists and coordinating with Dispatch. Together we decided an overweight landing was the best course of action. The Captain ran the non-routine landing considerations checklist and we received vectors back to Runway XX in ZZZ. We landed with a very low rate of decent in ZZZ at 156,700 lbs without incident. Upon arriving to the new gate maintenance was waiting for us. They noticed the aft E & E door was still open. When we called maintenance earlier they must have only looked at the more obvious forward door and neglected to check the aft door. This was also missed when we asked to confirm all doors were closed per the MEL. We received a new aircraft assignment and after receiving bags and fuel we made our way to ZZZZ.Cause - The doors must have been left open by maintenance or whoever conducted the security check that morning. We called maintenance to close the doors and they should have checked both doors since they are connected to the same switch.Suggestions - Multiple doors can utilize the same MEL, the E & E doors should have their own MEL that has more emphasis on both doors. We had no way of knowing the maintenance technician didn't check both doors. Prior to MELing there should have been a troubleshooting checklist to follow that emphasized both doors because the technician was eager to MEL the sensor when it was a simple fix.		Several access doors were open during pre-flight. Prior to push back I alerted the push crew the EQUIP light on the overhead panel was still illuminated. The push crew stated the forward E&E door was not closed. Maintenance was asked to come out and secure the open door. The door was properly secured, but the EQUIP light remained illuminated. Maintenance decided the issue could be addressed using MELXX-XX. The aircraft logbook was properly signed off and the flight continued. Aircraft failed to pressurize properly after takeoff. Returned to ZZZ and executed an overweight landing after conferring with Dispatch. Subsequent landing was exceptionally smooth. Normal braking was used resulting in a nominal landing distance followed by an uneventful taxi back to the gate. Once back at the gate it was discovered the main E&E door, located aft of the nose landing gear, was open.Cause - Access doors being improperly left open. Maintenance personnel failed to ensure all doors were closed after be alerted to the flight deck EQUIP light.Suggestions - Ground and maintenance personnel need to visually and physically verify all access doors and panels are properly secured.		B737 flight crew reported the electronic and equipment doors were not closed to maintenance. Maintenance failed to close one door and MEL the other resulted in pressurization failure and overweight landing at departure airport.

During the cruise portion of this flight, apparently there was an operation that had begun in the area. Was not aware of that until after landing, when some of the inflight crew informed us. We discussed the GPS threat as part of briefings. Generally spoofing has not been an issue in the terminal area, but it was highlighted as part of the briefing. XX2 so highlighted was the FM GPS Interference procedure, to be utilized if the jamming continued into the terminal area. As we flew the approach, the jamming continued onto the arrival, I decided to proceed with the GPS Interference checklist as we maneuvered onto the initial approach segment to prevent false EGPWS warnings and NAV Unable RNP messages, as the jamming appeared to be going to stay into the terminal area. [Although the] operation was going on, that we were not aware of at the time, the arrival and approach were normal. The approach was an ILS, so that was not an issue as we would be using ground based Nav aids. I was aware of the spoofing back in Date when we communicated to the Fleet and the GPS Interference procedure was developed.We did receive jamming through the approach and the NAV Unreliable RNAV message, but we had complied with the procedure and no EGPWS warnings occurred. ILS Approach and landing were normal on Runway XX. It would have been nice if we were informed of the [operation] as a security message to the flight when it began, as we could have used that information in our threat assessment for the last part of the flight, but we would have still briefed the GPS Interference procedure. However, if crews were not aware of that procedure, a message from Dispatch, may had prompted them to that procedure to mitigate the threat in the approach area. There was no new NOTAM for interference in the terminal area, just the usual enroute NOTAMs for interference, which is usually in the cruise phase, not always spoofing in the terminal area.				Air carrier Pilot reported GPS jamming.

Based on our performance calculations, we were legally and safely able to depart from that runway. We lined up on Runway XX and pushed up the thrust levers for takeoff. Just after commanding 'set thrust', we received an aural alert stating 'CAUTION SHORT RUNWAY, SHORT RUNWAY', as well as an EICAS message stating ' SHORT RUNWAY'. I immediately rejected the takeoff and retarded the thrust levers. We notified ATC, taxied clear of the runway, and found a spot to park the aircraft in coordination with ATC. After bringing the aircraft to a stop and completing the after landing checklist, I called the Duty Officer, who arranged a conference call with Captain. Based on their guidance, we temporarily selected the GND PROX RUNWAY OVRD switch to inhibit the RAAS (Runway Awareness and Advisory System) from giving us another alert on our subsequent takeoff. We completed the RTO checklist, as well as the after start and before takeoff checklist, verified our fuel was sufficient per the Flightplan/Release, and proceeded for another takeoff, which was uneventful. The RAAS on the B777 did what it was programmed to do, which is to alert the crew on a runway that has an available length of less than 7,500 ft. and the ground speed is greater than 40 kts. Runway XX at ZZZ has 7,278 ft. available. Not being familiar with this particular alert, I decided to reject the takeoff. I have never encountered this scenario in my six plus years of operating the B777, mainly because takeoffs on relatively short runways are rare, but I also do not recall seeing this scenario in any training environment. Maybe I missed it somewhere along the line, but it could be incorporated in a future syllabus.		On initial takeoff on Runway XX at ZZZ (both long runways were closed) as the aircraft accelerated through 40 kts., an EICAS alert 'CAUTION SHORT RUNWAY' illuminated on the center MFD, and simultaneously an aural caution sounded 'CAUTION SHORT RUNWAY.' The Captain immediately rejected the takeoff around 45 kts. We exited to the right on Taxiway XX and stopped the airplane. We communicated with Tower that we needed a few minutes to build a new plan and run checklists. The Captain called the Duty Officer and Chief Pilot to confirm our game plan of continuing the mission since this caution is normal for takeoffs on runways less than 7500 ft. We then proceeded with the flight with nothing significant to report. Both pilots were surprised by the EICAS and aural CAUTION during the takeoff roll. The performance numbers were all normal and appropriate for the 7,278 ft. runway. Upon further review, we discovered it is a normal caution for a takeoff on a runway less than 7,500 ft. Introduce the possibility of this caution during takeoff roll in simulator training and/or Training Manual.		Air carrier flight crew reported a rejected takeoff due to a Runway Awareness and Advisory System alert.

Both amber Reverser lights were illuminated. The #1 engine Reverser light went out shortly after clearing the runway, but the #2 engine Reverser light stayed illuminated. The First Officer notified ZZZ Maintenance. They said that only the right Electronic Engine Control had a fault. After further inspection, they reported that the right Reverser Lockout valve was improperly pinned (no streamer) in the lockout position. I had performed the walkaround in ZZZ1. I didn't notice the pin. The pin should have had a flag so that if was left by Maintenance the flight crew could have noticed it.		Upon landing thrust reversers did not deploy. The discrepancy was then written up and the Maintainers discovered an improper pin installed on a lockout for the right reverser. Captain did walk around and the improper pin was not discovered. I had no involvement. We were unaware of any pin discrepancies until maintenance brought it to the Crew's attention, after the write up was made. These specific 'lockout' areas are not part of our Crew walk around training. Better Maintenance follow up procedures. Also while the aircrew is not trained to look for these specific types of things, be as vigilant as possible during walk arounds.

We were full with one jumpseater in the flight deck. We taxied out to 24L. Ground Control put us behind a 757 in the line up. I used to be more concerned about wake turbulence behind a 757, but not so much now since the changes in separation behind 757s. In the old days, I would have just done a max thrust takeoff to reduce the chance of a wake turbulence encounter (it took about two seconds to do it). For us to do a last minute change now, we would have to send for new takeoff data, and run a Departure Checklist. I was tired and didn't think it justified it. I knew the Tower wouldn't appreciate the delay either. Since the FAA decided the wake turbulence of a 757 was not a problem for my 737, I didn't see a threat. Once the 757 departed, the Tower cleared us for takeoff. At 200 ft. AGL, we encountered the 757s wake turbulence. It was more than we anticipated. At multiple times, our aircraft was abruptly rolled to the right by the wake. I saw the FO (First Officer) counteract with full left aileron, even as the aircraft continued to roll right to 25 to 30 degrees of bank. This went back and forth as the ailerons became effective, then not so effective. At 1000 ft. AGL, Departure Control gave us a vector off the SID, and then we were out of the wake. Both the FO and I were very surprised how strong the wake was (and how ineffective the ailerons were at times while in it). The first thing I'll do [in the future] is to request a delay for takeoff from Tower, when departing behind a 757. I've heard guys ask for delays for this reason before, and Tower has not responded very well. It sounded like a huge inconvenience for them (Tower). The next thing I'll do is be more proactive in doing a max thrust takeoff. I think the FAA needs to add more separation between 757s and 737s (or similar). This IS a threat and needs to be addressed.				B737-700 Captain reported encountering strong wake turbulence departing LAX in trail of a B757, and recommended increased separation behind B757 and similar aircraft types.

Prior to this encounter the ride was smooth. We were flying westbound at FL340. Denver Center advised of an aircraft flying at FL350 at our 1200 position. Both the FO (First Officer) and I saw the aircraft and commented that it looked lower than 1000 ft. separation. TCAS readout was 900 ft. above our altitude for the approaching aircraft. All three altimeters read 34,000 in our aircraft. The aircraft approached us head on to the point where we could not see the livery to determine what airline it was or what type of aircraft. Seeing winglets it was probably a B757 or A321NEO. We both noted the winds at FL340 were 239 at 28 kts. which was less than 10 degrees off our heading to the left. A few minutes later we encountered moderate wake turbulence and after about 15 seconds the aircraft began to roll left at a good rate. Throughout the turbulence until the left roll, the autopilot was on and maintaining altitude. When the aircraft started to roll left, I clicked off the autopilot and rolled the aircraft to the right. After approximately another minute we flew out of the wake turbulence. There were no deviations in altitude or heading. During this wake turbulence encounter ATC was calling for a frequency change. After flying the airplane, we responded, reported the wake turbulence encounter and switched frequencies. We both forgot to ask what type of aircraft flew over us. After another frequency change, another sector asked if the aircraft had any damage or if there were any injuries. We looked at all the systems pages on the ECAM and couldn't determine any damage. There were no passenger or Flight Attendant injuries. Thankfully, all the passengers just happened to be seated. The Flight Attendants took their jump seats when they felt the turbulence even before we could make a PA or call them. This isn't the first time I have encountered wake turbulence from another aircraft passing within 1000 ft. of our aircraft. This is the most severe encounter and the most roll I have encountered. We both did not say 'Upset'. But we were both guarding the controls and ready to take control if required. Thinking back on it, I think we didn't say the word upset because the aircraft wasn't in an upset state but I wonder if I would have said it if the situation got worse. We definitely had positive control of the aircraft and both pilots were monitoring the situation. I wonder if the FAA has done an evaluation on the new aircraft with large winglets coming into the market for wake turbulence probability. Especially with light winds aloft.				A320 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence in cruise at FL340 from an opposite direction air carrier aircraft equipped with winglets at FL350.

We then noticed a amber R Eng Fail light. After looking at all the right engine instruments we confirmed that we indeed have a failure in the right engine. It was just a smooth roll back, no vibration or fire. We then [advised ATC] at first asked to stop the climb and maintain FL280, then after checking out our single engine altitude (22,500) we asked to descend below FL220 and that we were returning back to ZZZZ. We Accomplished all the appropriate check list even tried to accomplish a restart to no avail. [We told the Flight Attendants] what was going on and to prepare the cabin for a normal landing, [We also called] Dispatch to inform him as to what our problem was and that we were returning to ZZZZ. We also sent diversion information via ACARS, also sent a report to ATC. In the process of our returning to ZZZZ we had 2 FA (Flight Attendants) go on oxygen. FA at position #8 seat 3R had passed out hit her head and needed medical attention. We were told that there could have been possible fumes onboard. We decided not to dump fuel just get the aircraft on the ground. Performed the overweight landing check list. We ended up landing about 48,000 lbs overweight. Approach and landing were routine. We exited the runway on the high speed, stopped (I informed the passengers to remain seated and explained Emergency Personnel would be checking out the aircraft) we were given the all clear and then taxied to our gate. Paramedics met the flight and took the 2 FA's to the hospital for checks. Performed all remaining checklist items and write ups.		I was the Pilot Monitoring on this flight and had just begun my break when the Flight Purser notified me that I was being requested to return to the flight deck. When I reentered, the FO (First Officer) was the Flying Pilot and the CA (Captain) was the Monitoring Pilot. On climb out passing FL230 they had experienced a right engine failure. They had already [advised ATC] and was requesting a return to ZZZZ. I proceeded to communicate with the FAs (Flight Atendants) and Dispatch our status and intention to return to ZZZZ. I then completed a runway assessment for the overweight landing and continued to back up the CA on checklist items and the FO on radio calls. We attempted an inflight restart to no avail. At this point Instead of e were advised that we had 2 FAs in the rear of the aircraft that were on O2 and that #8 FA had passed out. Because of a possible fume situation we elected to not dump fuel and instead land overweight. (Approximately +48,000 lbs). Upon landing we exited the runway and had the emergency equipment check us prior to proceeding to the parking stand. Medical personnel met us and took both FAs to the hospital for treatment. We completed all remaining checklists and writeups.Instead of calling the cockpit for entry, next time I would use the electronic key pad. This was a mechanical failure that we could not have predicted		Air Carrier flight crew reported an engine failure during climb out. The pilots notified ATC regarding the failure and the probability of fumes in the cabin that had stricken two flight attendants. With clearance from ATC the aircraft returned to the departure airport and accomplished an overweight landing.

Over next hour or so there was a slow but obvious decrease in HYD Quantity from .84 to .55 when we decided to call CA back up. After coordination with M/C and DD, and more discussion among the crew, we elected to divert to ZZZ1 after being switched to VHF. We received excellent support from ATC and communicated our concerns about leaking fluid on hot brakes to ZZZ2 via ZZZ1 approach. We landed XR and cleared the runway for inspection by ZZZ2 Fire. They did not find any leaks, even after shutting the right engine down upon request. We taxied to the gate and upon engine shut down there, the leak was apparent and let loose. Through the strong leadership skills of Captain, this event was handled methodically and with excellent input from all involved. All ECLs and FM guides were utilized appropriately and lead to a well-managed non-normal event.		The following event occurred during flight XXY. Our scheduled flight time was XA:50 Zulu to XB:15 Zulu. We took off at XC:13 Zulu and were expecting to be arriving in ZZZ3 10 min ahead of schedule at around XB:05 Zulu. The first part of the flight was uneventful, besides a few weather deviations on our route of flight, as well as a change of altitude in search of a smoother ride. At around XD:25 Zulu, while cruising at FL370, we got an EICAS Message 'HYD PRES PRI R'. At the time, the Captain and I were upfront while the First Officer was still on break. We took a quick look at the Hydraulic synopsis page which showed an X on the right primary hydraulic pump. We ran the appropriate ECL checklist for the malfunction, which lead us to turn off the right engine primary pump switch.The Captain initiated a phone call with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and after a brief discussion about the possible implications of such a failure, we all agreed that we would continue towards our scheduled destination. At that time, there was no other concerns. The backup electric demand hydraulic pump was picking up the load and the hydraulic quantity still showed at a normal level of .80. At around XD:55 Zulu, the First Officer came back from his break and we brief him on what was happening. Before going on break, the Captain told us to call him if anything were to change and specifically told us to keep an eye on the right hydraulic quantity as it appeared to be slightly lower than 30 min earlier. Still it was, no cause for concern. All of the other systems were functioning properly. While the Captain was on break, we kept a log of the hydraulic quantity and it eventually became apparent that we were slowing losing hydraulic fluid in that system.So at around XE:30 Zulu, we called the Captain to advise him of the situation, and he came back and joined us on the flight deck. From that point on, all three of us were in the cockpit until we landed. The right hydraulic quantity was now at .50 and there was now no doubt that we were losing fluid. Not too long after that, the EICAS 'HYD QTY LOW R' was displayed. Of course, we had another discussion about the consequences of possibly losing the right hydraulic system all together. We were now about 2:30 hours from ZZZ3. We were well aware that even with a full right hydraulic failure, the systems lost are still minimal (loss of normal brakes only), nevertheless, after another conversation with dispatch and Maintenance Control, the Captain suggested and we both agreed that it would be safer to put the plane on the ground while we still had all major systems operating normally instead of continuing to fly for another 2.5 hours and face the prospect of a more severe situation. At that point, we were just an hour south of ZZZ1, so we decided the safest course of action was to head to ZZZ1, knowing that Company personnel and customs would be available to help our diversion recovery. Around XF00 Zulu, after we advised Dispatch, Maintenance Control, the Cabin Crew and the Passengers, we initiated our diversion towards ZZZ1 and requested priority handling. At that point, we were on VHF frequency with ZZZ Center, and eventually ZZZ1 Center. The rest of the arrival, approach and landing into ZZZ1 was uneventful, except for the fact that the right hydraulic fluid quantity kept getting lower. It eventually showed zero after landing. We were surprised to still see that demand pump keeping hydraulic pressure in the system. We landed on Runway XR. As a precaution, the crash and fire rescue trucks were waiting for us at the end of the runway. We were concerned about hydraulic fluid possibly leaking on the brakes. Before taxing, we shut down the engines and asked the fire crew to check visually for hydraulic fluid leaks or smoke. They told us they could not see anything and after restarting the engines, we then got a clearance to taxi to the north cargo area, where Company personnel, Mechanics and eventually Customs met us on arrival. There was a delay opening the doors while operations and customs were coordinating our arrival before deplaning the passengers. We completed all required checklists and the Captain called the company for the debrief. When we eventually exited the airplane, we were able to talk to the mechanics and they advised us a good amount of hydraulic fluid was leaking from the right engine after engine shutdown.		B777 Flight Crew reported an EICAS HYD PRESS PRI R at cruise. The Flight Crew performed the Non Normal Check List and observed the Right Hydraulic System Fluid decreasing. The Flight Crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

We had been at cruise for about an hour and half. Our Flight Attendants (FA) were bringing our crew meal to us. At that time I left the flight deck to use the front lav. Just after stepping into the front galley with the flight deck door closed I felt the aircraft momentarily yaw as if a brief rudder input had taken place. I also saw the rear of the cabin move back and forth. On this flight I was the pilot flying (PF) Captain conducting OE 2 with a new FO. At the time I supposed and that the FO may have inadvertently touched the rudder pedal. After returning to the flight deck I asked if the FO if he had inadvertently touched the rudder pedal and he said that he did not. He did feel yaw as well. The flight continued uneventfully for the remainder of the cruise flight. We eventually step climbed to FL380. During decent somewhere below FL340 I noticed some left control wheel input. About 8 degrees or so. I added some Left Rudder input and the control wheel went back to zero. A few minutes after the aircraft had a sudden yaw again. This time it was much more pronounced. I used a small amount of right rudder to settle the aircraft. I again asked the FO if he had touched the rudder, and he responded no. We were discussing this when the FA called me and asked about the sudden tail movement. I told the FA we were trying to figure out what had happened and were working on it. I made a call to my dispatcher on the SAT Phone and just gave a heads up that we had some uncommanded rudder input and would be writing it up when we landed.The rest of the flight was uneventful with no other issues.At the gate I called my Dispatcher on the phone, Maintenance Control and the Duty Officer. [Decades] on the 737 NG and have never had uncommanded rudder control input. We encountered brief uncommanded rudder input once during cruise and once on decent. Flight landed successfully.				B737-800 Captain reported the aircraft experienced uncommanded yaw events during cruise and descent. After the events, the flight continued to a normal landing.

Prior to running 'below the line' on the landing checklist we noticed the flaps indicated 15 while the handle was at 40 and our airspeed was at Flaps 15 Vapp. Upon using my judgement at the time and Captain's authority, we continued the approach at flaps 15. I moved the flap level to the indicated setting and selected flaps 15 Vref in the FMS. A Landing assessment for flaps 15 was completed and we had plenty of runway distance. I mentioned moving the GPWS flap override switch to override but by that time we were passing through 500 ft. and the FO was already hand flying. We never moved the override switch as I didn't want the FO distracted in a critical phase of landing. We landed and exited the runway safely as a nonevent. After landing I asked my FO to cycle the flaps and that appeared to be working normal on the ground. I also cycled the flaps again while waiting for a gate and they worked normally. Not sure what caused this; perhaps a potential malfunction of the flaps.				B737-800 Captain reported the flap indications and flap handle did not match during approach. The indicated flaps were 15 versus 40 on the handle. The crew continued the approach with flaps 15 and moved the flap level to 15 to match.

Dispatcher explained there was a deferred item that had to be cleared before he would unlock the flight plan, as the plane was only allowed to fly between Maintenance bases with that item. I asked to have it released so I could review the aircraft issue. He declined. Maintenance was at the gate, they removed the Maintenance Discrepancy. I reviewed the original write ups which appeared to start at the end of month with the last one on Date. The write ups described a lot of noise through 270 knots with slight airframe vibration. Several doors had been replaced, etc. There had been no additional reports following the Date write up. On departure, as we accelerated to 270 knots, a loud humming noise with noticeable, but slight, airframe vibration occurred and continued as we accelerated. I called back to the flight attendants and they said they also could hear and feel it, including all the way in the back. They thought it sounded like the 'engines were revving.' The engines all showed normal indications. While we do have an engine vibration checklist, (which was NOT indicated) we don't have an airframe vibration or loud humming noise checklist. I elected to return to ZZZ to have Maintenance assess for airworthiness to ZZZ1.The plane had been operating solely in and out of maintenance bases for several weeks so I didn't think it was a good idea to take it to a special use airport, with a very short runway, until it's airworthiness to land at ZZZ1 could be assessed. I have been flying only Boeing planes for [decades] now. I haven't heard a noise like that before. That led to my unease in continuing to ZZZ1 with the issue unresolved. Further, I start and finish most of my trips in and out of ZZZ1. Consequently I am very familiar with the challenges of that airport. While I've taken planes with all kinds of maintenance issues in and out of there from MEL auto throttles to auto brakes, those issues were all 'known.' This one was 'unknown.'Maintenance issues are part of our environment. When they occur, we have to make the safest decision we can balancing known risks and operational integrity. A flight check with maintenance on board prior to removing the deferred Item would likely have helped them identify the problem? While saying that, I recognize there were a lot of flights that didn't report anything since Date.				B737-800 Captain reported concerns over clearing of a Deferred Item. During flight, an airframe vibration was felt, exactly as contained in the Deferred Item. The Captain reported the incident to Maintenance.

Upon cycling the gear lever, the gear retracted normally. The remainder of the flight to ZZZ1 was uneventful. During my preflight inspection, I had applied pressure to the manual gear extension access door to ensure it was closed		After selecting gear up while departing from Runway XXR at ZZZ the gear failed to retract.

Then subsequently placing gear handle back down and then up again. The gear retracted normally on second gear retraction attempt. No gear anomalies were noted and flight continued to ZZZ1 with an uneventful landing.

Our takeoff weight was 185,000. We briefed the departure requirement of crossing NEZUG at or above 4,000 ft. as a threat, and voiced that the requirement should not be a problem if we delayed our acceleration and prioritized the crossing altitude. During the takeoff the winds were light and the outside temperature was about 85. The Tower cleared us for takeoff behind an A320 with minimal spacing between us. Climbing through 3,000 ft. we encountered [the A320's] wake which started to roll our aircraft left and right. I was the flying pilot, and elected to reduce pitch since we were too slow and heavy to increase pitch to climb above the wake. Our pitch reduction allowed us to duck back underneath the wake and resume flying in safe, smooth air. However, this pitch reduction also caused us to cross NEZUG at approximately 3,400 ft.We were also unable to ask ATC for relief at NEZUG because the radio chatter was too busy to interrupt. Our intent was to make the NEZUG crossing restriction at or above 4,000 ft., however, I elected to reduce pitch to avoid the aircraft wake which caused us to miss the crossing altitude. This conscious decision was made in the name of safety. We showed no other aircraft near us on TCAS or visually that we became close to during our climb. When cleared for takeoff close to another aircraft, we don't know that aircraft's weight, thrust, anticipated climb technique, etc. Awareness, judgement, and adjustment of our aircraft in the name of safety sometimes cause us to modify the initial plan during the flight.				B737-900 Captain reported they failed to make a crossing restriction departing SEA because a wake turbulence encounter prompted them to reduce their climb rate to minimize their exposure to the wake.

For all intent and purposes, this was a routine flight segment. We completed all required preflight checklist items and departed from the gate. Tower cleared us for takeoff on runway XYR [for an intersection takeoff] as planned and after liftoff, I called for gear and flap retraction on schedule and everything felt and sounded normal. I called for the after-takeoff checklist and at that point we noticed that the green landing gear lights had gone out, but not the red indicators. We leveled off the aircraft and discussed the indications that we were observing. After determining that it was a gear disagree indication, we divided duties. I continued to fly the aircraft and assumed control of the radios while the Captain would run the checklist. I informed ATC that we had an issue and requested that we stay in the local radar area while non-normal checklists were being conducted. The Captain checked the Manual gear extension door and circuit breaker panel and ran the gear disagree checklist from the flight manual. After completion of the checklist, the gear disagree indication still existed. Captain called maintenance control on radio #2 since we were still in the local area. Maintenance was informed of the steps that we had conducted and suggested that we cycle the landing down and then up. Knowing that this was going to feel and sound abnormal, Captain called the flight attendants to inform them of our issue and also to make a PA to the passengers that we were working an indication issue that required us to put the gear down. Once that was completed, I slowed the aircraft down to 225 KIAS for the retraction limitation of 235 KIAS. The gear handle was placed in the down position and all indications were normal. Captain retracted the gear and we received the same indications once again. The gear felt normal as it made its cycle both down and up. At this point we reported back to maintenance and they had no further suggestions. Captain called dispatch on AIRINC and had maintenance control phone patched into the call. After discussion with maintenance control, it was determined that we had exhausted all troubleshooting steps that could be conducted inflight. The decision was made to return to ZZZ and discontinue the flight in the interest of safety. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and had dispatch send landing data to the aircraft. We discussed the overweight landing (Approximately 4K) and felt safe that ZZZ was an appropriate destination. Through dispatch, we had station operations and maintenance informed of our return. The flight attendants and passengers were informed of our return to the ZZZ airport. We requested that airport crash fire rescue meet the aircraft to check the brake temperatures as we were above the normal landing weight. I planned a flaps 40 approach to bring the aircraft in as slow as possible to minimize the chance of overheating the brakes. We completed the rest of the required briefs and checklists, then informed ATC of our plan to return to ZZZ. We were vectored to the ILS XYL approach and landed without incident. The fire fighters met us to assess brake temperatures. They informed us that we were not showing any indications of hot brakes and followed us back to the gate. We arrived back at [the gate] and were met with maintenance, gate agents, and [company] personnel to debrief the incident.				Captain reported an unsafe landing gear indication after gear retraction on takeoff. The flight crew was unable to extinguish the unsafe indication after troubleshooting and running the check lists and QRH. The crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at the departure airport.

The LCA in training was the Flying Pilot. All preflight, push back, taxi and takeoff ops were normal without incident. We departed Runway XXL and began flying the departure profile. The gear was retracted after the positive rate gear up call. The Flying Pilot called for flaps up, after takeoff checklist. While reading the after takeoff checklist, we noticed that the red gear indicator lights were still illuminated. All other indications such as aircraft climb performance and outside sounds suggested that the gear was retracted. We asked ZZZ Center for a level off at 10,000 ft. and remained in the area to address the non-normal. After we identified the issue as a Gear Disagree and stabilized the airplane, I divided up the duties to have the LCA in training remain as the Flying Pilot and take radio number 1 while I read the non normal checklist. The non normal checklist procedure was followed, but the red gear indicator lights remained illuminated. Since we were still in close proximity to ZZZ, I contacted ZZZ Maintenance Control by radio to help us troubleshoot the issue. I knew I could make contact with Maintenance Control quicker than Maintenance at that moment. I also advised the purser of our situation since it was obvious that our flight path had changed. ZZZ Maintenance Control directed us to cycle the manual gear extension door from open to close. ZZZ Maintenance Control also directed us to extend the landing gear and retract the gear. We accomplished those troubleshooting tasks, but the red gear indication lights remained illuminated. We then called ZZZ and established a phone patch with dispatch and conference with Maintenance Control. I briefed Maintenance Control on all troubleshooting measures, and they directed us to check the circuit breakers. All circuit breakers were in. After all troubleshooting efforts were exhausted, I made the final decision to return to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and asked for aircraft fire crash and rescue equipment to meet us upon landing to mitigate the threat of hot brakes after an overweight landing. I advised the purser of our situation and diversion plan and made PA to the passengers. We began to plan for an overweight landing and advised Maintenance. We determined that a landing could be safely made in ZZZ on Runway XXL by utilizing flaps 40 landing data for the slowest approach speed. We transferred aircraft control for the approach briefing, completed the descent checklist, and advised ATC we were ready for the approach. The training LCA flew the ILS approach to XXL and landed without incident. Aircraft fire crash and rescue met us as we exited the Runway and inspected our brakes. After receiving the all clear, we continued our taxi to the Gate. We were met by Maintenance Control personnel and the ZZZ Assistant Chief Pilot as well. We completed our maintenance write ups, briefings to Maintenance Control and crew debrief. I can not say enough about the outstanding and professional job the training LCA Captain XXX, the inflight crew, ZZZ ARTCC and TRACON, ZZZ Maintenance Control, ZZZ Tower and the dispatch displayed while assisting and/or working this flight. It was a Company team effort to maintain the safety of our flight.				B737 Captain reported an air turn back and precautionary landing caused by an unsafe landing gear indication that could not be cleared.

I tried to open the QRH on the EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) but content would not load. I went to the paper QRH and found the Window Damage - Forward checklist. I determined the damage was only on the outer pane. The QRH said to continue normal operation. The Captain contacted dispatch and had a phone patch through to Maintenance. Maintenance said that if we were comfortable continuing the flight he was as well. After talking with the Captain we jointly agreed to continue the flight. I examined the entire windshield again and found what appeared to be a small 3 mm crack on the inner pane of window R1. This small crack did not align with the outer cracks. The Captain examined it as well. At this point we agreed to divert and [request priority handling] with coordination with dispatch. The Dispatcher recommended several airports in the area and we chose ZZZ. We started a slow descent and reduced speed to 250 kts. We landed uneventfully and taxied to the Gate.

During climb out from ZZZ, approximately 3 minutes after departure we discovered a fuel imbalance of approximately 680 pounds. The left main tank was low approximately at 7,920 pounds. The Center Tank still had over 4,000 pounds and the right main tank indicating approximately 8,610 pounds. At level off we watched the fuel and the left main tank seemed to stabilize at 7,920 pounds while we burned the center tank empty. After the center tank is empty we then Cross Feed to balance the main tanks. Monitoring our fuel burn with the HOWGOZIT we started to show an over burn. At one point comparing our FMC Progress page fuel report for positions passed we had over burned by 1,200 pounds. This had me very concerned sense we are now about in the middle of the ZZZ1 between ZZZ and ZZZ2. I send a ELB write up and on the single page describe the best I can of our situation for Operations. During the remainder of the flight the fuel indications appeared to showing various indications to the point I was concerned about how reliable they were. We ended up running the Fuel Leak QRH out of caution and continued to ZZZ2. We had an ALT, CF and ACF99 but we were eating into those fuels. I had a Dead Heading Pilot observe the left Engine and wing during running the checklist to confirm no visible fuel leak. He said he saw nothing unusual. After we parked at the Gate, Operations Personnel asked us what we had experienced. He said this aircraft had a history of this but it had not been written up in a month. That would explain why I saw nothing about this type of fuel problem but it did have a MEL XX-XX-X for a Number 1 Engine Valve Closed Light. The Operations Personal also said they wanted to take the airplane to the hanger to fix the fuel problem but were getting push back to keep it on the line. That made me mad and very concerned. I have never had to run the Fuel Leak checklist in the airplane and with no airfield immediately close by it was not a very comforting feeling. I had pages and pages of dents and scratches for the airplane but NOTHING about the very important history of the unreliable fuel system. I would definitely NOT fly this airplane again until properly fixed.				B737-900 Captain reported fuel quantity systems indications were unreliable and erratic during ETOPS operations. The Flight Crew ran the QRH and checklists, but were unable to solve the problem. The Flight Crew elected to continue flight to destination airport.

The condition continued for roughly 30 seconds when the Low-pressure lights extinguished and the system stabilized. We noted that the hydraulic quantity had dropped from roughly 95% noted during pre-flight to roughly 64%. Since the lights had extinguished by this point, we elected not to run the QRH but rather we noted the steps that would be taken, should the condition re-manifest. We continued our climb and the Captain turned flying and ATC COMMs over to me, as he left to establish COMMs with Dispatch and Maintenance. As I continued the climb, I noted that the hydraulic quantity was slowly decreasing at a rate of approximately 1% quantity every 90 seconds or so. The Captain relayed this information to Maintenance Control and it was decided that a diversion was needed. Given our close proximity to ZZZ, we decided to return to our point of departure. In our descent into ZZZ, we noted that the quantity was getting close to 50% so we elected to extend the gear approximately 30 miles north of the field. Upon extension, the system pressure came up to approximately 65% and stabilized. Because of this, we elected not to declare an emergency as the system quantity was no longer dropping and the landing gear was down and locked. It was noted that an overweight landing was going to be necessary given the deterioration of the A Hydraulic Fluid. We consulted the handbook and it was noted that a brake cooling calculation would not be necessary. The Captain made an outstanding touchdown and we proceeded to the Gate without incident. Upon post-flight inspection, we noted a significant amount of hydraulic fluid still flowing from lines off of the port side system.				B737-700 First Officer reported they received Low Pressure lights for the engine driven and electric hydraulic pumps on the A system during departure. The crew noted the hydraulic quantity was at 64% down from 90% during pre-flight. The lights extinguished but the quantity kept decreasing, so the crew decided to return to the departure airport after discussing the situation with Maintenance Control.

While conducting After Takeoff cleanup items, we noticed the EQUIP annunciation light was illuminated. We ran the QRH checklist and determined the aircraft wasn't pressurizing. We called Departure, advised them of our situation, and requested to return to ZZZ RNAV XX. Approximate weight was 142,000 lbs., so we were below maximum landing weight. Everything was uneventful, we landed and went to Gate XX shortly after landing.Upon arrival at the aircraft we noticed the #1 IDG was disconnected, MEL was properly annotated in the logbook, switches were placard. The APU would have to be online for the entire flight. Thus, we would have the DRIVE annunciation light illuminated during the flight. It's possible we missed the EQUIP light on the overhead panel thinking it's was the DRIVE light due to its close proximity. Thoroughly scan the overhead panel during the system annunciation recall.		Shortly after takeoff on Runway XX the First Officer and myself noticed a rumbling sound coming from the lower forward fuselage. During climb out we investigated and saw the 'EQUIP' light illuminated. We referenced the QRH checklist and determined that the aircraft was not pressurizing. We made a call to Departure and requested the RNAV approach to Runway XX as we needed to return to ZZZ. The aircraft weighed approximately 142,000 lbs and was below maximum landing weight. I decided to not request priority handling as I anticipated a normal landing and taxi back to a gate. A normal approach and landing brought us back to Gate XX at ZZZ.It seems as though the First Officer and I both missed the EQUIP light illuminated on our preflight checklist. We reviewed the situation in our minds and neither of us remember seeing it. However the system was not malfunctioning therefor we had to have missed it. The largest casual factor that I can think of is due to an MEL item that was on the aircraft. One of the generators was inoperative and we were required to leave the APU generator online for the entire flight. Because of this, one of the 'DRIVE' lights on the overhead panel remained on. The DRIVE light is located a few inches away from the EQUIP light. It is possible that we mistook the EQUIP light for the DRIVE light.I believe this occurred due to a level of complacency. And possibly because a DRIVE light was illuminated nearby. From a checklist/procedure standpoint it should have been captured. A more thorough and deliberate approach to completing the checklist is the best way to prevent this from happening again. I believe I will be more vigilant in the future.		B737-800 flight crew reported hearing an unusual sound coming from the lower forward fuselage. While conducting After Takeoff cleanup items, it was noticed the EQUIP annunciation light was illuminated. The flight crew requested priority handling and conducted an air turn back and made an overweight landing at departure airport. The forward equipment bay access door had been left open after maintenance.

The Flight Attendant (FA) stated 'there's a fire in the cabin and a lot of smoke, I'll call you back'. My First Officer (FO) and I looked at the engine instruments and pressurization panels, everything looking normal. My FO pulled the QRC and QRH. I [requested special handling] and requested radar vector for a diversion to ZZZ1, which was about 80 miles off our nose.When I got back to my FO, he briefed me on the situation. A passenger had a small electronic device inside her purse, filling the cabin with smoke. They pulled and used the fire extinguisher, reached to the device and put it in a containment bag. I made the decision to deviate from our company procedures, which call for running the QRC/QRH because the source of the smoke was determined and they were no smoke or smell in the flight deck. My concern was to land the aircraft at the most suitable airport in point of time since the FA was still concerned by the smell.We believe the smell was the residual from the fire extinguisher discharge, but I could be wrong and didn't want to delay the landing. We set up the approach, ran the appropriate checklists and received [landing data] for an overweight landing. The Fire Department made a wheel well inspection and convened with Dispatch that it was safe to park at the gate with the parking brake off. I want to commend our Flight Attendants for the way they handled the situation. They kept us informed of the development of the incident, which helped us in our assessments. We didn't have to second guess and run the risk of calling for the wrong check lists. My FO did a tremendous job of being the liaison between the FA and myself, allowing me to focus on flying the aircraft first. He also kept the passengers informed of our intention.		I was the First Officer on Aircraft X, ZZZ2-ZZZ on Date. We were cruising at FL 360 between the ZZZ VOR and ZZZZZ intersection, southeast of ZZZ1, when we received a call from the Flight Attendants that there was 'a fire in the cabin and there is a lot of smoke, we'll call you right back.' A quick scan of our engine instruments and the pressurization panel indicated no abnormalities, and we did not detect any smoke or fumes in the cockpit. The Captain told me that we should [request special handling] with ATC, and we quickly discussed that we were close to ZZZ1 and that would likely be the most suitable airport to land. The Flight Attendants called me back and they advised me that they had identified the source of the smoke; a passenger had a portable battery charger in their purse to charge their cell phone and that it was overheating and causing the smoke in the cabin. While I spoke with them, my Captain [requested special handling] with ATC and we received a vector towards ZZZ1. Shortly after, we were cleared direct to the ZZZ1 airport and had a descent clearance. I had pulled out the QRC and the QRH in preparation for the Smoke/Fire/Fumes Checklist, however we ended up deviating from company policy due to the fact that our Flight Attendant's had identified the source of the smoke/fumes and that there was no smoke or fumes present in the cockpit. Our priority was to get the aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. While this was happening, the Flight Attendants attempted to extinguish the battery with a Halon fire extinguisher with no result. They quickly determined that they should use the lithium battery containment bag that we have on the aircraft. They ended up taking the passenger's purse with the battery in it and placed it in the containment bag and doused it with water that they had available in the cabin. Once they did that, they informed me that the battery was contained and under control and that the smoke was clearing out of the cabin. I asked if there were any passengers having breathing issues or if anyone was injured and they replied 'no, not at this time.' I asked them to keep me advised if any passengers were having issues breathing and that we were diverting to ZZZ1. I then focused on our descent into ZZZ1 and getting the aircraft safely on the ground. I gathered the ATIS information and then ran our Performance Data for ZZZ1. We loaded the approach for Runway XXR into the FMC and did a Quick Approach Briefing. [Landing date] came back and said we would be overweight for landing and to run the [brake cooling procedures]. I proceeded to run the brake cooling and it returned data stating that we would need one hour of brake cooling without the parking brake set and that we should notify ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to come and perform a visual inspection of the landing gear after landing. Once we arrived on the ground in ZZZ1 quickly and safely, we exited the runway with ZZZ1 ARFF following us. They performed a visual inspection of our landing gear and wheel wells and advised us that our brake temperatures were within the normal range and that they observed no abnormalities. My Captain then called Dispatch while we were stopped on the taxiway to confirm whether or not we needed to remain off the gate for the full one hour, and it was determined that we would be OK to taxi to the gate, but we would need to be chocked at the gate and leave the parking brake released. We then taxied to Gate X without further incident.I would like to recognize my Captain for staying calm and collected throughout the entire event. He kept the aircraft under control and we performed a safe landing in ZZZ1. I would also like to commend our Flight Attendants for their extraordinary actions that quickly brought the entire situation under control and prevented what could have been a fire spreading throughout the cabin and becoming a very bad situation.		Air carrier flight crew reported a battery charger experienced a thermal runaway during cruise. The Flight Attendants utilized the thermal containment bag to contain the device while the flight diverted to a nearby airport where a safe landing was made.

While on the ZZZZZ Arrival Crossed ZZZZZ [fix] 210 Knots and 6,000 feet. ATC directed to 3,000 feet, then HDG 070. As PM I selected Flaps 1 and then HDG 070, 170 KIAS and F5 as I extended course for ILS XXR. Noted that the Amber Leading Edge Flap Transit Light remained illuminated and Flaps had stopped close to F1 but still between 0-1. Began QRH Leading Edge Flap Transit light as the initial condition. After identifying QRH Ck list with PF, I realized that I needed more time to complete the QRH and might have to complete a Flaps up landing if we were not able to provide F15 through alt flap extension procedures so [requested priority handling] provided reason as flap malfunction with souls on board and fuel remaining and requested ILS XXL for ZZZ longest runway. Next Requested long vectors and a turn out at present altitude. ATC sent us north toward ZZZ2 to de conflict with vectors and a climb to 4,000 feet. After completing initial QRH steps for Leading Edge Flap Transit Light, Flap condition 0-1 no asymmetry and  then followed Ck list to its conclusion in the Alternate Flap Extension procedure. When on a long final manually set flaps to F15 using alt flap ext procedure and reviewed F15 landing data I had requested from dispatch. Once the dual response landing checklist was completed and briefing finished, broadcast to ATC that we planned a normal F15 landing, no further assistance, repeated same to ZZZ tower when asked and reiterated a normal F15 landing no further assistance. Repeated same after uneventful landing and taxi to gate. Called  Dispatch, Operations and made maintenance write up for the condition.Being familiar with the long and specific QRH for Leading Edge Flap Transit light and it's possible outcomes, I chose to [advise ATC] to receive both priority handling, time and the longest runway in the event of Flaps UP landing. Knowing I could possibly achieve a normal landing and in the best case. Glad it all went according to QRH best case...and we had time to review and execute the correct Ck list and follow the complicated decision tree without outside pressure.				B737-900 Captain reported Amber Leading Edge Flap Transit Light remained illuminated and Flaps had stopped close to F1 but still between 0-1 on approach. The flight crew continued to destination airport and completed a safe landing.

We requested a level off from ATC and the CA asked me to run the Non-Normal 700/800/900/ER Stabilizer Out of Trim checklist. Following each step, we confirmed the stabilizer was not trimming with the autopilot engaged; the CA turned off the auto pilot/throttles; we confirmed the stabilizer was not properly responding to manual electric trim inputs (i.e. only nose down trim inputs were able to be applied electrically); and, we took note the last step directed us to execute the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative procedure next. At that point, the CA asked me to contact the Flight Attendants, give them a synopsis of our situation, and request they bring the Company 737 CA up to the cockpit to render assistance. Upon entering the flight deck, the CA briefed the DH (Deadhead) on the situation, he verified our assessment of the aircraft malfunction, and the CA asked him to back us up. Then, I read and accomplished the 700/800/900 Stabilizer Trim Inoperative Checklist (up to the Deferred Items section) while the CA and DH confirmed each step. Next, the CA transferred aircraft control to me, gave the flight attendants a briefing, coordinated with Dispatch, and solicited inputs regarding a potential divert from the other flight deck members. With the support of Dispatch and the cockpit, the CA elected to divert to ZZZ; notified ATC and Dispatch; [advised] ATC (due to a higher work load associated with manual trim requirements); and, coordinated for us to land on the longest available ZZZ Runway (XXR). Further along our route, the CA calculated our VREF15 approach/target speeds and Non-Normal landing distance; briefed the arrival and Flaps 15 landing; and, resumed PF duties. Shortly thereafter, we performed the Deferred Items checklist, flew an uneventful arrival, accomplished the landing checklist, and the CA executed a smooth FL 15 overweight landing. Afterwards, we taxied normally to the gate, shut down the aircraft, submitted maintenance write ups for the malfunctioning stabilizer trim and overweight landing, conducted a face-to-face briefing with Maintenance personnel, and completed the Parking and Termination checklists. A couple hours later, we flew the passengers on a different aircraft to their intended destination (ZZZ2) without incident.

Completing the landing was in question due to heavy rain on the field. Turning final extended flaps to 1, 2, 5. At flaps 5 amber bands on airspeed converged at flaps 2 green bug flying airspeed on both pilot's airspeed indicators. Momentarily got 'Airspeed Low' Aural alert. This caused confusion as LE FLAPS TRANSIT was the actual problem, but we did not recognize it and thought there was a standalone airspeed malfunction. Performed AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE QRC action items and executed go-around out on final approach (10 miles) and cleaned up flaps. Airspeed returned to normal. Diverted to ZZZ1 as a ZZZ landing in approaching heavy rain was not desirable with malfunction. Extremely busy in divert with briefing Flight Attendants, Dispatch, Passengers, ATC. and deviating around weather. Two separate ATC Controllers requested same details on emergency status FOB etc., and Dispatch requested we divert to ZZZ2. Fifteen minutes after initial problem and very busy with flying, diverting, etc., we still weren't sure of what our problem was. I read through AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE QRH Checklist items after transferring aircraft control to the First Officer. We discussed it and decided it was not applicable now as airspeed was normal with flaps up. Decided to go hold and reattempt flap setting to analyze airspeed and flaps. In holding, after lowering flaps we got the same indications and it was then that we observed the LE FLAPS TRANSIT amber light on the forward panel with no green light (all green LE indicator lights on overhead panel) with flaps at 1. Thereafter was able to run the proper QRH and performance data associated non-normal procedures and land flaps 15 at ZZZ1, which was VMC conditions and dry runway. Fuel was about 6000 pounds on landing after the delay with the holding pattern. Had we gone to ZZZ2, we would have been lower fuel state with some weather en route. We were so busy in the flight deck with non-normal checklists, setup for divert etc. decided to stay with nearest suitable field (ZZZ1), which was our precoordinated alternate prior to our ZZZ arrival and the initial occurrence of the malfunction. Uneventful flaps 15 landing was accomplished and 30 minute holdout for a gate due to brake cooling.Monitor the flaps indications better at each separate extension setting.  We regularly by standard operating procedures perform the Before Landing Checklist after final configuration and we acknowledge flaps 'green light', but we may not always notice the leading edge green light(s) at each extension point where it should be illuminated.		Weather: storms on/around ZZZ during ILS approach with a 7-knot tailwind and RA showers on the field. Turning to final we extended the flaps to 5 and began to slow towards approach speed and initiated a descent to 2500 ft. per ATC instructions for the ILS. The minimum maneuver speed did not decrease as expected while configuring to land. The max maneuvering speed and minimum maneuvering speeds came within 5 knots of touching quickly followed by 'Airspeed Low' when slowing towards the flaps 5 maneuver speed. (I saw the LE FLAPS TRANSIT amber light in my peripheral vision, but it did not register until later due to the concern for the 'Airspeed Low' alert.) The pilot flying (PF) initiated a stall recovery and go-around, asked that I turn off the Flight Directors, and make inputs into the Mode Control Panel (MCP) to comply with ATC instructions. I advised Tower that we needed to stay VMC and requested vectors to the east to remain clear of the storms so we could determine the malfunction. Tower coordinated with Departure for us to turn towards the northeast (towards storms) and climb to 4000 ft. MSL (into IMC) and to contact Departure. I contacted Departure and requested to return to 3000 ft. and to turn east to remain VMC and mitigate increasing workload by flying in the storm clouds. Upon consulting with the Captain I [requested priority handling]. Departure acknowledged our [request], allowed us to remain VMC at 3000 ft. MSL, and turn towards the east to remain clear of storms. We were then handed off to Center. I asked the Captain if I could fly while he coordinated with the Flight Attendants, the Passengers, and Dispatch. I contacted Center and requested to hold so we could determine the malfunction. The Captain said we would divert to ZZZ1 since it was VMC and was added as an alternate by Dispatch via ACARS while on the STAR. I advised Center we would eventually divert to ZZZ1 after holding. Center cleared us direct ZZZ1 and asked if we wanted a higher altitude. I responded 'yes', and we climbed to 10,000 ft. MSL. En route to ZZZ1, Center cleared us to the Arrival to ZZZ1. I advised Center we needed to hold. Center cleared us to hold as published. I programmed the FMC to hold. During the climb, we discussed the Airspeed Unreliable QRC/QRH items. We determined that all three sets of instruments were in agreement. ATC also provided us with our ground speed, which matched our instruments. We determined the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist was not applicable to our situation. Enroute the Captain let me know that he finished coordinating with the Flight Attendants and Passengers. Center relayed that Dispatch requested that we divert to ZZZ2. The Captain relayed that ZZZ1 was the nearest suitable airport and we were diverting there due to fuel concerns, the longer runway at ZZZ1, and unknown weather at ZZZ2. Approaching holding, we changed PF duties (the Captain flew), noted our airspeed, and began to extend flaps as if we were landing in order to determine the malfunction. The same sequence of events occurred as on final to ZZZ, minus the airspeed low. The Captain accelerated and we started to retract the flaps. I saw the LE FLAPS TRANSIT Amber light this time with flaps 1.The Captain called for the LE FLAPS TRANSIT QRH. We completed this QRH, computed non-normal performance data and brake cooling, briefed the approach and actions and after landing, and requested vectors to final for the ILS at ZZZ1. At some point, Center asked if we were still a [priority] aircraft. We responded in the affirmative and passed all requested information. Center passed us to ZZZ1 Approach. Approach Control asked for the souls on board, fuel on board, and any other requirements. We requested [assistance] due to potential hot brakes. The Captain flew an uneventful approach and landing, braking manually upon touchdown. After landing we coordinated with ATC and Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) for remote parking. I re-ran brake cooling based on manual braking and the brakes on speed I noted during touchdown. The inputs returned a required 30 minutes of cooling prior to approaching the gate and an additional one hour before departure. Although not required by the Brake Cooling module we coordinated for CFR to measure the brake temperature, chock the nose wheel and right wheel set, release the parking brake, and cool the brakes with fans once the engines were shut down, since they offered, while we waited for the expiration of the brake cooling time. The highest brake temperature recorded was 340 degrees Fahrenheit on the right brakes.		B737-800 flight crew reported diverting to an alternate airport after experiencing leading edge flap issues.

We were assigned a level off at FL 230. Attempts were made to re-engage the autopilot to no avail, so a manual level of at FL 230 was made. Since initially the autopilot would not engage in either A or B, we informed ATC we could not continue into RVSM airspace. Multiple information was missing from the VNAV page in the FMS. The TAT was giving erroneous readings. There was no SAT. There was no TAS on the Captain side. There was no pitch bar on the Captain side. No N1 limits were displayed only green dashes. Using ACARS we informed Dispatch of our issues. They responded saying we should run QRH page XX.X FMS FAIL. We didn't have that indication. We only had a VNAV disconnect. We also informed Maintenance to meet the jet in ZZZ. We had sufficient fuel and weather was not an issue. Since the First Officer had better information on his displays, I transferred controls to him and he landed without further incident. ZZZ Maintenance found a fault code on TAT probe. After clearing the fault, they said we were good to go to ZZZ1. Immediately after take off the same problems happened again. The Company was quickly informed since we were so close to ZZZ for a possible return. The decision was made to continue since we had plenty of fuel for the short flight and weather was VFR. We again elected to not go into RVSM airspace even though this time the autopilot seemed to work on the First Officer's side. Dispatch was notified through ACARS again. They asked why were were not using page XX.X in the QRH. We didn't use that checklist because we didn't have that indication, so it didn't apply. The issue was written up again after landing in ZZZ1.Our main concern was who in Dispatch was telling us to run a QRH Checklist that didn't apply to the situation.				B737-700 Captain reported experiencing autoflight anomalies related to failure of the TAT probe climbing out of FL200.

The First Officer forgot to turn them back on after engine starting. We performed the appropriate checklists and the appropriate calls were made, but we forgot to visually check the bleed sources were in the correct position, when the Captain responded to the checklist. We climbed out as normal, but as we were performing the 10,000 ft. Checklist, the Cabin Pressure Warning horn and light went off. We leveled off at 10,000 ft., told ATC and immediately realized what we had done. We turned the bleeds on, went through the QRH to resolved the issue, and the cabin pressurized as normal. We notified ATC and the Flight Attendants, continued the climb and proceeded on course as intended. No others issues entailed during the flight. Threats to this situation were an extremely early report time and early morning awakening for both Crew Members. First Officer was new and Captain visually looked at bleeds during checklist and responded with what was 'expected' but not as the bleeds actually were.Making sure that you respond to what you see not what you expect during checklist callouts And verifying bleed sources are in the correct position, after engine starting and shutting down the APU.				B737-700 First Officer reported the flight took off with the pneumatic bleed valves closed, resulting in failure to pressurize. The crew noticed and corrected the error.

We were watching the #2 main tank quantity dropping rapidly. The #1 Main fuel tank read approximately 8,500 pounds and the #2 tank read approximately 7,600 pounds and dropping. As we diagnosed the issue in the climb, we shortly thereafter, received the Fuel Imbalance Alert. I flew and ran the radio with ATC while Captain ran the checklists. We [requested priority handling] and I coordinated with ATC for a level off and a return to ZZZ. We ran the Fuel Leak Engine Checklist in the QRH, and shut down the #2 engine per the checklist. We coordinated for [Runway] XXR due to the long runway, accomplished a brake energy calculation, and I transferred the aircraft control over to Captain, to fly the ILS. We taxied clear. The Emergency Crew verified we looked good, and we taxied to the gate uneventfully. I feel like all outside parties handled the event admirably. ATC was very helpful. We had a lot of Crew coordination going on, so we had to tell ATC to stand by with providing them with amplifying information about souls on board and fuel remaining. I should have just told them that info upon first declaring the emergency instead of waiting until all checklists were completed.Fuel imbalance over 1,000 pounds leading to diagnosing a fuel leak, accomplishing the checklists, and returning to ZZZ.				Air Carrier First Officer reported a possible fuel leak during climb, resulting in fuel imbalance. Flight crew returned to the departure airport and landed.

Our TCAS issued a traffic alert and Aircraft X showed 800 feet below us and climbing. RA happened at 600 feet separation! I called out my aircraft disconnected the A/P and complied with TCAS climb. ATC and Aircraft X were arguing their altitude, I think I shouted over everyone Company flight XXXX TCAS climb!!!We received level off at 35.4 and as Aircraft X passed below us I saw red target 400 feet below on TCAS screen. Clear of conflict we returned to 350. I then called back to flight attendants to check on them and passengers. The flight attendants stated the maneuver was barely noticeable and everyone was fine. We continued normal, safe flight to ZZZ and Aircraft X got a phone number for a pilot deviation.

During the climb out, we encountered multiple strong wake turbulence pockets of 1-2 seconds. I continued to hand fly the jet with the autothrottles engaged. ATC was talking quite frequently and we continued to hit pockets of wake turbulence. This was challenging for me to keep the nose of the aircraft on the flight director during flap retraction and level off and I became fixated on the flight directors. The jet commanded 310 KIAS at 3300 ft. because as I realized later; I had improperly set our NADP1 departure and deleted the speed restriction of 250KIAS. We caught the mistake at 290 KIAS and pulled the throttles back. ATC kindly reminded us of the 250 KIAS below 10,000 ft. We continued to encounter pockets of rain and turbulence but the rest of the departure was uneventful.		New FO (First Officer) (originally assigned as IRO, 1st flight outside IOE) was given a flying segment on return leg. New FO programmed FMC manually with speed and altitude inputs instead of autoloading data via FMC 'Takeoff Ref Uplink' button. New FO manually input 310kts at 3300 ft for the acceleration height on VNAV Climb page on NADP1. CA (Captain) and [other] FO did not catch error during loading of FMC. Flight had undergone a runway change from Runway 08L to 26R. On climbout, [we] encountered high workload with FO manually flying aircraft as [we] accelerated with flap configuration change and wake turbulence while attempting to deviate around weather. On level off [we] accelerated towards 310 kts. and CA noticed exceedance at 290 kts. CA manually selected VNAV speed intervention for 250 kts to slow aircraft.		B777 flight crew reported exceeding 250 kts departing LFPG after incorrectly programming the FMC. Wake turbulence encounter was also cited as a contributing distractor.

The Flight Crew failed to do so, without notifying Approach. There was no loss of separation. ATC did accommodate the failed intercept with vectors that eventually lead to a stabilized approach and a safe landing. Distractions, threats, and task saturation that led the Flight Crew to prioritizing aviating over communication were the following:Non-Normal Fuel Imbalance that resulted in a return to departure airport situation, minutes after takeoff (1500 pounds). Running the QRH and troubleshooting for a possible fuel leak during most of the return to the field flight time. Becoming situationally aware, that landing immediately would result in max landing weight being exceeded, while simultaneously realizing that the Fuel Imbalance was no longer trending negatively. ATC's efforts to expeditiously vector Fight Crew to begin the approach, while being too high to safely do so. Notifying Flight Attendants, Passengers, and Dispatch of the issue and decision to return to the field. First flight of the day with a Cockpit Crew that had never flown together before. Fifth day of reserve with minimum sleep. The previous duty day ended hours after midnight with a 'Sound Check' and Live DJ Wedding hotel event that ended at XA30 AM. This Crew Member estimated less than four hours of sleep. The Flight Crews thoroughly debriefed the event and came to the following conclusions: The above situation may have been mitigated, had the Flight Crew better coordinated with each other and ATC. The result may have been longer vectors, to provide more time to process the increased task loading and troubleshooting, once the Crew realized that the fuel imbalance trend had been reduced and eventually reversed. Taking a pause to communicate that the overweight landing was now a higher risk (versus the fuel imbalance) may have helped ATC to aid the Flight Crew with less expeditious vectoring and thereby avoid task saturation considering the high number of threats experience in the short flight back to the originating airport.		Encountered a sudden fuel imbalance annunciation showing 1,300 pounds difference shortly after takeoff. Made decision to return but got rushed after ATC cleared us direct to field. While running checklists and coordinating with Flight Attendants, the Captain flew through final. We immediately coordinated to get vectors and landed [uneventfully].		B737-700 flight crew reported a track deviation occurred while returning to departure airport following a fuel imbalance issue.

Of note auto brakes were MELed INOP and Runway XX was dry. I briefed an approach to ILS XX at ZZZ. As it is a relatively short runway (7,001 ft.) and we had INOP auto brakes I briefed that I would touchdown at 1,200 ft. on the runway and use max manual braking and max reverse thrust and turnoff at XX Taxiway. During the landing flare I reduced thrust to idle and touched down with the thrust at idle. I would also like to note this was not a bounced landing. Speed brakes deployed normally. After touchdown when I was reaching forward from the thrust levers to deploy the thrust reversers I felt the throttles start to advance. At that time the speed brakes also stowed themselves as the thrust started to increase as the thrust levers re-advanced themselves. I felt the aircraft start to reaccelerate so I quickly closed the thrust levers to idle which they then stayed at. I also started applying max manual braking. Fortunately the First Officer (FO)/Monitoring Pilot (MP) noticed the speed brakes retracting and re-extended them for me as I dealt with stopping the aircraft. Because of the startle factor associated with these various events occurring I forgot to use reverse thrust. Fortunately this did not affect our stopping distance as Runway XX was dry. In any case I was still able to turn off at the pre-briefed XX Taxiway.The unexplained advance of the thrust levers after touchdown [caused this event]. As I stated I brought the thrust levers to idle in the flare and touched down with the thrust levers at idle. The aircraft touched down and settled normally to the runway and there was no bounce landing involved. I am still at a loss to explain why this happened. Fortunately I had briefed for a landing on a short runway and used the tools I had except for forgetting to use reverse thrust due to the startle factor. This did not affect landing distance but if this had occurred on a contaminated runway forgetting to deploy the thrust reversers could have led to a runway overrun which would be disastrous on Runway XX at ZZZ.Hopefully Boeing or my airline could brief us why this would occur during a normal landing touchdown. As I previously stated I have no idea why this occurred. I do know this same problem has been reported at my airline by other pilots of this type of aircraft.	Reporter stated he asked for feedback from his company, and was told there was an article on this topic in a past issue of their safety magazine, but without a reference to the date of the issue he has been unable to find it.			B737-800 Captain reported the thrust levers auto advanced re-accelerating the aircraft after touchdown requiring immediate action to move the levers to idle and slow the aircraft down.

ATC cleared us down to 3000 ft. The FO (First Officer) was the Pilot Flying, and I was Pilot Monitoring. The FO was doing a shallow descent about 500 FPM to maintain at or near glide slope. ATC said he needed us to increase to 'standard rate descent'. The FO increased to 1000 FPM. We were expecting ATC to clear us for the approach (it was visual conditions and we had reported the airport in sight), but he instead cleared us to 2100 ft. and at 2100 ft., cleared for the approach. We assumed he still needed the higher rate of descent, so we continued. Just before FINKA, the FAF, we experienced wake turbulence and approximately a 40 degree left bank with an aural warning. The FO did a great job recovering and recovered by FINKA. At FINKA, Approach switched us over to Tower, and I informed him we had some significant wake turbulence. He replied, 'from who' in a somewhat condescending tone. I said 'from the preceding aircraft'. He said, 'that would be an A320 3 miles ahead' again in a somewhat condescending tone. I was not too appreciative of the way he spoke to us like an A320 wouldn't produce enough wake to roll us, but it did. We were merely reporting it.I believe we should clarify with ATC why they need us below preceding aircraft on approach even if it is a narrow body and clarify the clearance. Also, ATC should be made aware that it can cause wake turbulence events. We experienced it.		We were on vectors to intercept the localizer for ILS 16R. After being cleared down to 3000 ft., ATC reminded us to maintain a standard rate of descent. As PF (Pilot Flying), I had only been descending at about 500 FPM so we wouldn't go too far below glide slope with traffic 3 miles ahead and potential wake turbulence. I increased our descent rate to 1000 FPM. Just before we reached 3000 ft. we were cleared to '2100 ft., then cleared the visual 16R'. It was clear to me that the Controller wanted us down at 2100 ft. before intercepting the glide slope. I made sure to maintain 1000 FPM descent, but at about 2400 ft. we hit wake turbulence strong enough to roll the aircraft momentarily to about a 40 degree left bank. I recovered and leveled off at about 2300 ft. until intercepting glide slope and then continued the visual approach. The Captain advised the Controller that we had a 'pretty significant wake turbulence event'. The Controller asked 'from what?' The Captain said 'preceding traffic'. The Controller said that would be an A320, 3 miles ahead, and to contact Tower. I was a little distracted and got a few kts. slow on short final, but recovered for a normal landing.I am not sure why the Controller needed us that low before we intercepted glide slope. I haven't seen that kind of requirement before in SEA. We had 3 miles separation behind a narrow-body aircraft so it was a valid clearance, but it still imposed some risk. I hope there was a greater risk of some kind that justified this unusual clearance.		B737-900 flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence on approach into SEA 3 miles in trail of an A320.

We were about to start our ZZZZZ arrival over ZZZ1. During our cruise systems check, we discovered the oil quantity indication on the ENG2 appeared to be lower than usual. ENG1,16 qt. ENG2, 6.5 qt. I decided to contact Dispatch for a Maintenance Control consultation. This communication with Dispatch was through SATCOM with a few failed attempts at least twice since we got the failure messages on the FMGC and the call dropping or a weak voice from the Dispatcher. I also tried through ZZZ1 Dispatch VHF XXX.X. When I did this, I accidentally tune the frequency on VHF 1 out from ZZZ Center, but flipped the ZZZ frequency back to it.When we finally got hold Maintenance Control through SATCOM, at that time the oil quantity was at 5.5 on ENG2. I explained our situation and concern with Maintenance Control and a possible engine leak and the trend of oil quantity, recommending to divert to ZZZ1 for a precautionary landing. At that present moment we had an ECAM advisory caution for ENG2 oil qty, 5 qt. Since Maintenance Control concurred with our plan for diverting to ZZZ1 we informed to ATC and continued our descent to divert. Another consideration to this decision was the marginal weather at ZZZ2, with light rain and low ceilings with a front coming into the area. The weather at ZZZ1 was VFR. The inflight and customers were briefed for the divert due to oil engine indication. We were vectored around for our sequence into ZZZ1, RNAV XXL. At this time, a priority was not declared yet.As we continued our descent at low power setting, the oil quantity ECAM advisory for ENG2 was still present and decreasing, 4.5qt. At that time, [priority handling was requested] and the inflight were briefed for a code yellow. We started the APU for systems redundancy. Once we were approximately 15 miles final and cleared for the RNAV XXL approach, our oil quantity for ENG2 was as low as 2qt at leveled off and temperature rising, I believe it was 138 C and increasing, if I remember correctly. It was evident, this was an oil engine leak and not an indication issue. Concerned about an engine damage and having an ECAM warning during short final a busy phase of flight, we performed a precautionary engine 2 shutdown, thrust lever 2 idle and engine master 2 off followed by completing the ECAM actions procedures. We continued the approach and the landing was uneventful. Once cleared of the runway, we briefly stopped at the taxiway for fire and rescue staff inspect the engine 2, if there was any visible damage. They discovered no damage but an apparent minor oil leak from the bottom of the engine. It took only a few minutes to asses this situation before we taxied to the gate. Upon arrival, we met with tech ops and gave them details of our situation. They commented that it was good we salvaged the engine, the oil leak was quite visible and evident once the cowlings were open. Finalizing my narrative, in spite of the circumstances, a rapid decreasing oil quantity on ENG2, [First Officer] and I did our best on bringing the airplane safely on the ground at ZZZ1 where the weather was favorable. It was an overwhelming situation trying to get hold of Dispatch or maintenance at the beginning due to the SATCOM connection issue and the time constraint. But at the end everything was accomplished safe and professional.However, in retrospect. I was really concentrated on getting the aircraft on the ground quickly once [priority handling was requested]. I would have emphasize on a potential precautionary engine shutdown during the approach briefing. It seemed that even though that my FO and I had a continuous dialogue and talking out aloud as we were descending to ZZZ1 we saw ourselves making a last minute decision for a precautionary engine shutdown. Perhaps doing the engine shutdown earlier would have gotten more time to review the contingencies for the flight. In-spite of how comfortable I feel flying the A320 this was a definitely a learning experience for me to manage my time accordingly.		During our flight from ZZZ3 to ZZZ2, somewhere close to top of descent, the Captain who was the Pilot Flying (PF) brought to my attention the oil quantity level for our number 2 engine. The oil quantity was significantly lower than engine number 1 by about 10 quarts and this was causing some concern. The Captain elected to contact maintenance and Dispatch with his concerns and loop them into the situation and determine an appropriate course of action. After conferring with Maintenance Control, we elected to divert to ZZZ1 which was close by instead of continuing on to our destination as the oil quantity kept decreasing significantly faster than a normal burn rate, as well as the advisory message on the ECAM showing 5 quarts of oil in engine number 2. While on the patch with Maintenance Control and during reduced workload I consulted the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) to see if there was any specific guidance for low oil quantity but I was unable to find any. The weather in ZZZ2 also aided in our decision being marginal and ZZZ1 having better weather. ATC was informed of our decision and intention to divert to as well as the reason and we were given a further decent as well as answering the typical questions, 'were we [requesting priority handling] at this time?, reason for the divert decision, if we needed any assistance?'. At this time we elected not to [request priority handling], but did request one shortly after in order to get priority handling and get the aircraft on the ground as quickly and safely as we could. The customers and in-flight were also briefed. While being vectored into ZZZ1 we noticed the oil quantity was still decreasing reaching as low as 2 quarts. While thinking aloud and in the interest of safety and not wanting the oil quantity to completely reach 0 quarts and to prevent any damage to the engine or have it malfunction during this critical phase of flight, we decided an engine shutdown would be the best course of action last minute and the associated ECAM actions were accomplished. This was done as not to add any more complexity to the situation and we continued in for a single engine landing which was accomplished by the Captain uneventfully and flawlessly. Upon exiting the runway CFR which was standing by inspected the number two engine and did let us know that there was some oil they could see on the cowling of the engine. We then elected to taxi to the gate under our own power where we were told maintenance would be waiting for us. After a quick inspection by the maintenance personnel, they did confirm that in fact there was an oil leak and even showed us where it was coming from as well as stating we did the right thing by shutting the engine down and preventing any damage to the engine.		A320 flight crew reported due an engine fuel leak they shut an engine down and diverted to the nearest suitable airport.

We continued to climb and retract the flaps, to get some altitude to troubleshoot while manually trimming the aircraft. My electric trim refused to work as well. I pulled the checklist for Stab Trim Fail to start working the problem while [the First Officer] controlled the aircraft, and we elected to stop climbing at FL 190. We elected to return to ZZZ, and ATC gave us vectors to return and descend. I alerted Dispatch that we were returning, told the Flight Attendants, and made an announcement over the PA to the Passengers. First Officer continued to fly the aircraft with me assisting with the manual trim, while I got the performance numbers loaded and worked the radios. I briefed the approach to Runway XXR, then took over flying for the final approach and landing. After landing we ran the brake cooling [checklist], and it indicated that we were good to taxi to the gate.		After takeoff from Runway XXR I applied nose up trim to the electric stabilizer trim switches on the control wheel and the trim did not move. I told the Captain that the stab trim wasn't working, and continued to fly the departure. The Captain ran the checklist for Stabilizer Trim Inoperative, and we decided to return to ZZZ. The Captain made a flaps 15 landing per the checklist.		B737 Captain reported a Stab Trim Fail after takeoff. The crew ran the appropriate checklists and returned to the departure airport for a precautionary landing.

First Officer used oxygen momentarily due to lung irritation. Smell dissipated somewhat below 10000 feet, but still there. Contacted Flight Attendant's to ask if they were OK, and they said they didn't smell anything abnormal. We wrote up the aircraft upon arrival at the Gate, contacted the Duty Officer, and filled out the air quality event form. This aircraft had multiple air quality and air bleed issues in previous days. I think that it would be better policy to prioritize APU deferrals and air bleed issues rather than to defer them.				A320 Captain reported a very strong sweet oily odor during descent which dissipated somewhat at lower altitudes. Upon gate arrival a logbook discrepancy and an air quality form was submitted.

We donned our oxygen masks and started a descent down to reduce the differential pressure per the procedures. The Seat belt sign was on. The Flight attendants were informed of the issue and instructed to strap into their jump seats. I [requested priority handling], informed ATC of the problem and was cleared to descend. Dispatch was advised via ACARS and a prudent decision was made to divert to ZZZ. I made a passenger announcement, briefly explaining the issue and our decision to divert to ZZZ for a Normal landing. We landed uneventfully. Dispatch and company were notified and a maintenance discrepancy was logged.				A320 Captain reported a cracked windshield during cruise resulted in a diversion.

I saw an amber flash on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) but didn't see what it was. I assumed it was the altimeter reminder to go to STD, but noticed we were below 18000 ft. As we approached 18000 ft. and went to standard, the 'AS DISAGREE' illuminated with approximately 8 kts. variance between my PFD and the First Officer's (FO). I continued to fly while I asked the FO to get out the checklist. We ran the QRC and followed up with the QRH and continued the climb while running the initial checklist. As we climbed, the disparity grew greater eventually close to 20 kts. At that point the engine instruments went to '-' s and I told ATC we were returning ZZZ. I briefed the Flight Attendants, Dispatch, ATC and the passengers. I opted to [request priority handling] so we wouldn't have to fly the STAR back in and because it would be an overweight landing. I got a bit task saturated on final. As we were configuring on final, we were gear down and flaps 25 by about 2,000 ft., but I was late getting fully configured to flaps 30 at approximately 800 ft. due to talking to ATC about our intentions and ZZZ command procedures.It was a very benign event initially but got more intense as we were procedurally directed to turn off the autothrottles and as we continued to climb briefly. Then got distracted and slightly late configuring to final flaps below 1000 ft. In retrospect, I should have let the FO fly since he had the correct info displayed, instead of just making his flight director the master and using that.		Uneventful up this event. During out climbout on the ZZZZZ 3 SID, at approximately 16,000 ft., I noticed an amber light on the Primary Flight Display (PFD). Knowing it was coming close to our transition altitude, I assumed without verifying that it was our altimeter reminder to set STD. Shortly after, I noticed that we weren't at 18000 ft. and the amber light had momentarily extinguished. When it came back on, realized it was the IAS Disagree light. I was the pilot monitoring so I immediately looked at all three airspeed sources and the Captain and I quickly noticed that his IAS was the one at fault and was showing about 8 kts. faster. I pulled out the QRC and QRH and ran the Airspeed Unreliable checklist and confirmed with the IAS disagree checklist which directed me to the Airspeed Unreliable checklist. The Captain elected to fly while I did the checklists and facilitated the return to ZZZ with ATC. As we continued the climb while working the checklist and our game plan, the error with the IAS grew to as much as 20 kts. When that happened, we also lost some of our engine instruments. This solidified that we needed to return much sooner and elected for an overweight landing rather than burn down fuel. The Captain continued to fly and I ran the QRH and coordinated the [priority] return. As we descended, the IAS and the engine instruments returned to normal indications. The rest of the descent and landing was uneventful. After landing, we precautionary went to a holding pad to have safety vehicles view the aircraft and the brakes to ensure no hot bakes situations existed before returning to the gate. Gave the plane to maintenance and debriefed them. I am not aware of any causal factors that we played a roll in. The event was very benign and only got worse the higher we climbed as we were already running the checklist. After we saw it getting worse, we immediately coordinated for our return and ATC approved a decent which helped alleviate the deviations. After the flight, the Captain and I debriefed the event and both agreed that a transfer of the aircraft to the FO with the good displays would have been a better decision, inline with current SOP. Otherwise, since it was mechanical, there wasn't anything we could do to prevent this from happening again.		B737-800 flight crew reported they received an Airspeed Disagree warning followed by other instruments failing so they returned to the departure airport and made an overweight landing.

Also notified Operation/Dispatch via local company frequency. We attempted to recycle the flaps selector a 5th time and this time we regain control of the slats. We continue an advised ATC the situation was resolved, no request for priority handling was made and we returned for normal landing.				A320 Captain reported a F\CTL SLATS FAULT was observed on approach. The crew conducted a go around and ran the checklists and QRH.

In visual conditions it has been obvious that weather was within and above our altitude (confirmed with WSI EFB radar display). The radars displayed no weather returns at all. When within 80 miles, the radar depicted some returns but all were hashed out in green, meaning our altitude was well above. Visual verification proved this to be false. Once within the 40-mile scale, it would more accurately depict intensity and height, but by then it could be too late to make a preemptive turn.Two Mechanics informed me that there was a known corruption of the data on the -800's memory that depicts return tops. The most recent Mechanic also said how temperature (heat) sensitive the transmitters are and he blew out a canister filter that was full of debris. We have recently been reminded of turbulence injuries to Flight Attendants. The scenario I have written about happening in IMC or night conditions, when 100% of our faith relies on accurate radar returns, could lead to inadvertent penetration of thunderstorms.				Air carrier pilot reported problems with the B737-800 weather radar not working correctly on numerous aircraft.

After reviewing company documentation, we decided to brief and request the RNAV XX Approach even though it was day VMC. ATC offered the visual approach. We thought the best way to manage risk and plan the descent was to fly the RNAV approach in visual conditions. We were cleared direct ZZZZZ. Then cleared to cross ZZZZZ at 13000 ft. and cleared for the approach. As the Pilot Flying (PF), I set 5700 ft. in the ALT window and verified and called LNAV/VNAV PATH. When checking the FMC, I was sure that I was looking at 13000 ft. because that is what I expected to see. However, I realized later that I actually saw 11300 ft. for the segment between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1. ATC called when we went below 13000 ft. just prior to ZZZZZ with an Altitude Alert. We climbed back up to 13000 ft. and continued the approach. We were above the path at that point. We always had the terrain in sight and did not receive a GPWS caution. We continued the RNAV approach in visual conditions and landed without incident.First of all, this could have been prevented by more deliberate CRM. The First Officer (F/O) and I both thought we saw 13000 ft. in the FMC. 11300 ft. is similar. However, it should have been caught with CRM. In addition, it is rare to change or program an altitude on an RNAV (RNP) Approach that was loaded from the FMC. Besides the similarity of the numbers, it more common to get an RNAV approach clearance in which the first crossing altitude is already codified in the FMC. It is the norm. I should have caught this error. However, those two factors (different than the norm and similar numbers) lead to the expectation bias. Beginning descent below the ATC assigned altitude at the IAF on RNAV approach.				B737-700 Captain reported receiving a 'TOO LOW' altitude alert from ATC. The Captain then realized the wrong altitude was set in the FMC. The Captain states CRM should have caught the error.

We were given a clearance to cross MARRC intersection at FL180. I read that back and we started down on path to cross MARRC at FL180. As we got close to MARRC, we encountered very strong wake turbulence. The aircraft encountered moderate turbulence and an uncommanded rolling moment. The Autopilot disconnected and we lost guidance both vertically and laterally. We got that straightened out fairly quickly. In the midst of dealing with that, we were cleared to cross BEUTY at 11,000 ft. I read back BEUTY at 11,000 ft. as normal, and as normal there is no reply to that from ATC. I noticed at the time that the chart showed to 'expect' BEUTY at 13,000, but I didn't think much of that because many times we get altitudes other than the charted 'expect' altitudes. We descended normally to cross BEUTY at 11,000 ft. and we got a frequency change. We checked in at 11,000 ft. and got no answer as the frequency was very congested. I waited a while and tried again. The controller asked what altitude we are at, which immediately sets off alarm bells in my head and the First Officer (FO) as well. I replied that we are at 11,000 ft. and there was no reply. I waited a moment as the controller dealt with other aircraft and I asked him why he asked us. He responded that we were assigned 13,000 by the last controller. I replied that we heard 11,000, and at that time I had read back 11,000. He had nothing else to say to us on the matter. We continued on to LaGuardia as normal with no further discussion with ATC on the matter.On the post flight debrief, the FO concurred that while he had his hands full as flying pilot due to the wake turbulence encounter that he heard 11,000 as well, and he heard me read back the clearance to cross BEUTY at 11,000. Also, he agrees that ATC did not reply with any correction at that time.		We were on the Milton 4 arrival and instructed to cross MARRC at 18,000. As we were descending, we encountered what we believe was wake turbulence at approximately 19,000 and around 18,500 the autopilot went into CWS P and CWS R. At this point I was hand flying the airplane and the Captain was in the process of turning the flight directors off then on and restoring LNAV/VNAV, when ATC gave us a crossing restriction at BILEY. I thought I heard the controller say cross BILEY at 11,000. The Captain read back cross BILEY at 11,000, then he set 11,000 in the mode control panel. With LNAV/VNAV and the Autopilot on, we continued our descent. We leveled at 11,000 and ATC asked what our assigned altitude was, the Captain responded 11,000, that we had been told to cross BILEY at 11,000. ATC had us turn left then back to the right. I mentioned to the Captain, I wonder why he asked our assigned altitude, with BILEY being charted as expect to cross at 13,000, I wanted to know if we got the 11,000 altitude wrong. He queried ATC and the Controller said he was expecting us to cross BILEY at 13,000, he didn't know why the previous Controller would have instructed us to cross BILEY at 11,000. We landed in LGA and taxied to the gate. With the turbulence or wake turbulence, the automation going into CWS P and CWS R we had a lot going on. I thought I heard the crossing restriction being 11,000 and that's what the Captain heard as well. It's possible that we misheard the instruction and we should have confirmed the altitude with ATC.		B737NG flight crew reported descending below cleared altitude on arrival into LGA following a miscommunication with ATC. A wake turbulence encounter earlier in the descent was cited as contributing.

On climb out the lead Flight Attendant (FA) at door 1L called flight deck and told the CA that door 1L was louder than normal. The noise was somewhat noticeable on the flight deck, but I was wearing noise cancelling headset so I would say it was only slightly louder than normal. The CA relayed the FA's information but did not suggest we return to ZZZ at this point or change our plan to go to ZZZ1. At some point between the FA's call, and before 10000 ft., I stopped hand flying and turned on the AP. The airplane was light due to the less than 1 hour flight, so it was climbing rather quickly (approximately 3000-3500 fpm). It did not take much time after the FA's call that we passed through 10000 ft. MSL. As we climbed through approximately 12000 ft. the cabin altitude light came on with the associated horn. I asked the CA to request a descent to at least 10,000 feet and suggested we initiate the immediate action items and don our oxygen masks. We donned our oxygen masks and established communication using the overhead speakers.ATC gave us an initial descent to 10000 ft. At the time, I did note the highest cabin altitude we reached was 11000 ft. I used the AP B and LVL CHG with speed brakes to descend to 10000 ft. The CA requested a return to ZZZ with ATC and then gave me the radios so he could coordinate with the FAs and make a PA to the passengers. At some point after initiating the descent below 10000 ft. we both agreed that it must be that the main cabin door was not fully closed, despite the FWD ENTRY light being extinguished. ZZZ ATC gave us a further descent and vectors to the airport while the CA coordinated with the FAs. During this time I quickly set up for the visual approach backed up by the ILS. When the CA checked back in with me, I suggested we run the CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING checklist and he said he did not think it was necessary. He took back the radios and spoke to ZZZ regarding the return. Prior to our final descent, I suggested one more time that we run the CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING checklist and he again disagreed. I quickly briefed the visual approach and asked for a DESCENT checklist. We configured normally ran the LANDING checklist and made an uneventful landing. Due to an influx of traffic at that time, no gates were available when we talked with operations and they temporarily parked us on an apron.				B737 NG First Officer reported returning to departure airport after experiencing a pressurization issue related to a cabin door not being fully closed.

Possibly it is maintenance related and the spoiler levers or the micro switches need to be adjusted. We aborted our takeoff from XXL out of ZZZ on a B737. The spoiler lever was in the slot, I selected TOGA and got the configuration warning horn. I clicked off the throttles and aborted the takeoff, while less than 20 kts. The First Officer (FO) had immediately reached up and banged the spoiler lever and the alert went silenced. He did it before I even got the throttles to idle. But, we aborted the takeoff anyway, per the SOPs. We taxied off the runway, performed the before takeoff check and our second takeoff attempt was uneventful. The FO said the spoiler lever didn't move at all when he banged the lever to turn off the alarm. It was in the slot. The FO was an Air Carrier X 737 sim instructor and the previous day he told me he had experienced 2 spoiler alerts during takeoff in the previous three weeks. This would be his third event in as many weeks. While we were waiting to take off behind another Air Carrier Y 737 from Runway XXL, they also aborted their takeoff right in front of us, for a spoiler related takeoff configuration warning horn. So that made it 4 takeoff spoiler related warning horns the FO has seen in three weeks. I've never seen the spoiler cause a takeoff warning horn in my couple thousand hours in the 737 from the right or left seat.The spoiler may not have been seated all the way into the closed and locked slot. But, the FO stated that while he pushed on it to reseat the spoiler, while I was aborting the takeoff, he could not feel any downward movement. Once off the runway I pushed down on the spoiler handle and it was definitely seated. However, I noticed that there was the slightest play in the spoiler forward and aft, while it is in the slot. I don't know whether that is related to the micro switch not being activated.I realize we are waiting for the new configuration button to push, prior to takeoff that may resolve this issue. I am also aware Boeing states that cycling the throttles back and forth prior to takeoff, over time, may damage the fuel control. But the FO said for decades Air Carrier X procedures have been to quickly cycle each throttle forward and back to idle, while taxing to the runway. They do only one throttle at a time and quickly, so as not to cause any change in thrust. He also said when he flew 737's for Air Carrier Z, they would also cycle the throttles prior to take off. His assumption is that Air Carrier Y is the only company that doesn't cycle the throttle prior to take off. Of course, that is only one pilot's opinion, without any data. While on the other aircraft type, we also cycled the throttles before takeoff. We did both throttles simultaneously, since the engines were much slower to respond. Granted, while in the Military, it was never a procedure to cycle the throttles to check takeoff configuration prior to takeoff. But, something is causing the increased frequency in spoiler related configuration alerts and it maybe maintenance related.				B737 pilot reported rejecting a takeoff in response to a spoiler configuration warning horn. Pilot stated there is an increased frequency of these warnings and recommended maintenance action to determine the cause.

First Officer retarded the thrust lever and oil quantity indication returned to normal. We discussed gulping. Attempted to advance thrust level again past 82ish%, and again oil quantity decreased and engine alert box flashed. We made other attempts to advance thrust level, both level at 10000 ft. and 15000 ft. Both attempts yielded the same rapidly decreasing oil quantity. We referenced Quick Reference Handbook (QRH); however, there was no guidance. Made the decision to divert to ZZZ1 as we were essentially over the airport. Elected to not shut down engine due to normal engine indications at the lower power level. Diversion and landing were uneventful.		During initial climb it was observed that the right engine oil quantity indications were decreasing and low. The flashing alert box began flashing and we soon observed the right engine oil quantity showing as low as 13% and decreasing. I disconnected the autothrottles, left the autopilot engaged and informed the Captain that I would decrease power and decrease pitch attitude. Upon decreasing power below approximately 82% N1 it was observed that right engine quantity levels began to return to normal readings. We tested our hypothesis by increasing the engine power above 85% to see if the oil quantity level on the right engine would decrease. We increased and decreased engine power three times, and each time right engine oil quantity decreased when power was increased beyond 85% N1. These attempts happened between 10000 ft. and 15000 ft. After referencing the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and discussion we made the decision to divert to ZZZ1. We opted to keep the affected engine operating as low power settings showed normal indications. The diversion, descent, approach, landing and taxi to the gate were uneventful.		B737 Flight Crew reported reference to the QRH for engine oil quantity alert failed to provide any situational information, resulting in a diversion.

We donned our oxygen masks and I coordinated with ATC to divert to ZZZ. After the FO (First Officer) performed several steps of the smoke checklist, assisted by the jumpseater, the smoke smell disappeared. We continued for a safe landing in ZZZ, had the aircraft evaluated after clearing the runway by CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) personnel who then followed us as we taxied to the gate, and deplaned the passengers. The CFR stayed to evaluate the aircraft after deplaning and ensure no active fire remained. [The probable] cause [was an] unknown malfunction in the avionics ventilation system.				A320 Captain reported a burning odor during cruise. Flight crew coordinated with ATC to divert to a suitable alternate where a safe landing was executed.

At approximately 1400 ft AGL, we saw that both flap needles had stopped at 25 but the flap lever was in the flaps 30 decent. It took a moment as we confirmed that the hydraulic pumps were all on and that we really did have an issue. I told the FO (first officer) that I would need him to do a slow controlled go-around and that we will not raise the flaps and don't accelerate past 180 knots. At approximately 1000 feet, I called for a go-around as briefed. The FO flew while I talked and ran checklists. I informed the tower that we would need some vectors to work out a flap issue. We confirmed and accomplished the 'Flaps-Trailing Edge Flap Disagree' non-normal checklist. I tried to use the Dispatch 'call me' function on ACARS but was unsuccessful. This all took several minutes and we did not have fuel for further delay. After briefing the arrival, I told tower that we were ready to proceed to the field and that we were going to perform a normal landing. I did not feel it was necessary to [request priority]. I informed the Flight Attendants of our situation and that we were proceeding back to the ZZZ for a normal landing.  I also made an announcement reassuring the passengers. The FO flew a visual approach to Runway XR and made a flaps 15 landing. After landing, we did not move the flap lever. We taxied to the gate without further incident.

I was the Pilot Flying (PF). Climbing out of 7,000 ft. we experienced a loud bang, accompanied by severe shaking and vibrations. After a second bang, I looked at the engine indications and saw the right engine was surging severely. I suspected a compressor stall.  I immediately shallowed our climb, pulled the thrust lever to idle and the compressor stall went away with normal engine indications at idle. The Captain (CA) initiated a request for priority handling with ZZZ Approach, and we leveled off at 8,000 ft. We ran the ECAM procedure and pulled out the QRH for Engine Stall. We ran it and tried several times advancing the thrust lever, and the compressor stall returned every time. We left the thrust lever at idle, ran the single-engine approach procedures and told ATC we were diverting to ZZZ2. I continued being the PF and flew the ILS to [Runway] YYR. The landing was uneventful, and we exited the runway. As we began exiting the runway the engine auto-shutdown and displayed an Engine Stall ECAM. I transferred control to the Captain, ran the ECAM procedure, and we came to a stop. Airport Rescue & Firefighting checked over the aircraft and the right engine and saw no abnormal indications. We taxied to Gate XXX and disembarked the passengers as normal.No factors played a role in this from the flight crew. All indications and procedures were normal up to this point.No suggestions, this was a mechanical issue.		Departed ZZZ on Runway XX, Captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM), First Officer (FO) was Pilot Flying (PF). Climbing through 7,000 ft. we heard [a] loud banging accompanied with shaking. Shortly after Flight Attendant (FA) reported flames from #2 engine. Requested priority handling with ATC and leveled off at 8,000 ft. Followed ECAM procedure. Normal engine parameters at idle. Made several attempts to raise above idle but engine stall returned. Started APU. Sent message via ACARS to dispatch intent to divert to ZZZ1. Notified ATC of intent to divert to ZZZ1 also. Weather was CAVU. We went through single engine procedures. First Officer continued being PF and we flew the ILS [Runway] YYR ZZZ1. We cleared the runway. As we came to a stop engine #2 failed on its own. Airport Rescue & Firefighting met us as requested. After an inspection by fire personnel we continued to Gate XXX.		A320 flight crew reported compressor stall on takeoff with the right engine. The flight crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

The aircraft already was deferred with one R fire loop detector inoperative. With the second loop failure, we had no fire detection at all on the right engine. I continued to fly and assumed the radio responsibilities while the Captain first went through the non-normal checklist (there is no procedure for that malfunction) and then made the Satcom call to the Company Dispatch and Maintenance assets on the ground. The Relief Pilot made it up to the cockpit from his break and helped coordinate with the cabin crew. While the Captain was busy with the company, I began determining possible divert locations available to us in case that became a reality.After the Captain conferred with Maintenance and Dispatch, and then with myself and the Relief Pilot, we all agreed the most prudent thing to do was to divert to the nearest suitable airport. We determined ZZZZ was the airport most suitable. We considered ZZZZ1 and ZZZZ2. ZZZZ was the closest and had good weather. The Captain the [requested priority handling with] the Controllers. We were instructed to enter present position hold for fuel dumping and our clearance coordination to ZZZZ. We entered a present position hold and began dumping fuel to our max landing weight less burn to ZZZZ. We had XXX.X entering the hold and at the start of dumping which happened pretty much simultaneously. We dumped down to 93 thousand and landed at approximately 553 thousand under maximum landing weight. The arrival and landing into ZZZZ was uneventful.		During pre-flight it was noted that the aircraft had a maintenance write up detailing a faulty fire detection loop. The rest of the pre-flight and the departure were normal. Shortly after my rest period began, I was in the pilot rest facility and received a call from the Captain saying that we were deviating and to report the flight deck. Once in the flight deck, I was informed that the other loop on same engine had failed. The decision to divert to the nearest suitable airport, ZZZZ, had already been made and requested to ATC. The divert was fully coordinated with Dispatch and the cabin crew and passengers were informed. The rest of the flight was uneventful. After landing, we worked with Maintenance as they worked on the problem. Troubleshooting showed a failure of the fire test.		B777 flight crew reported both right engine fire detection loops failed so they diverted to the nearest airport.

Simultaneously, we experienced wake turbulence and a temporary loss of Flight Director and ILS signal. I thought the signal could be blocked by the preceding aircraft. We advised ATC, but immediately regained all information. I elected to continue the approach, but the disruption and distraction possibly got us temporary unstabilized. We acquired the runway shortly after, and continued visually for a normal landing.There was a lot of confusion at the time of the event. We debriefed after parking and agreed that a go-around would have been the best course of action. I would like to mention that there was additional confusion about selecting other modes.		We were cleared for the approach on the ILS to Runway 16L to DEN. At about 2000 [ft.] AGL, we experienced what we thought of as wake turbulence from the aircraft in front of us and loss of ILS signal, which caused the Flight Director to disappear and the Autopilot disengaged. I advised ATC, at which time everything on the ILS returned and the wake turbulence stopped. The Captain was flying and decided to continue. All of this happened within just a couple of seconds and as soon as everything returned, we could see the runway. We may have become unstabilized during that short time period.We were surprised by the loss of the ILS, Flight Director, turbulence and autopilot disengagement all at the same time. When we were at the gate we talked about it and both agreed we should have just gone around and figured out what exactly was going on.

Shortly after leveling at FL310 and while accelerating to .78M we all noticed a burning smell followed immediately by observance of smoke emanating from right cockpit sidewall behind First Officer's seat. We all immediately donned O2 mask and I (as pilot flying (PF)) initiated left turn back to ZZZ. [We requested priority handling] and then FO and third pilot (Flight Test Engineer) began working the problem with the Smoke, Fumes, or AVIONICS SMOKE checklist. The problem seemed to resolve shortly after the first 6 steps of the checklist were performed. Smoke was no longer visible and odor was not detectable. [Priority] status was maintained in order to keep priority handling with ATC and RTB continued at best forward speed. Shortly after descending through 10,000 ft. the situation reoccurred this time with heavier smoke emanating from cockpit sidewalls on both sides. At this point we were being vectored onto downwind for XXR ZZZ. We requested immediate vectors to XXR and were offered Runway XX which we accepted as it was off our nose and less distance. Some S turns were performed on short final to lose altitude and airspeed followed by a full stop landing on Runway XX. By then smoke had once again dissipated. We opened cockpit windows and ran first 6 steps of Evacuation checklist stopping before Fire switches (Engines & APU) ...Push as engines had shut down normally and APU was never started. Fire Crew and Tower both reported no evidence of fire so we remained on Aircraft with windows open until Tug and Airstairs were brought to aircraft. We did leave batteries on for the purpose of radio communication with Tower. No additional info.The cause is unknown at the moment. Our recommendation for ourselves as well as other aircrews in the industry is to further train communications with O2 mask on. Things to emphasize would include volume levels of cockpit speakers, knowing in advance whether or not you want to remove cockpit headset and glasses, proper use of intercom transmit switches, etc. The amount of background noise generated by breathing O2 is highly distracting and could be significantly mitigated by more training and comfort with the use of the O2 mask. Having just come out of the Covid pandemic I suspect that emphasis on this type of training has probably waned industry wide.				Air Carrier Captain on a post maintenance test flight reported smoke and fumes filling the flight deck from the sidewall. The pilots established priority handling with ATC and returned to the origin airport. The Captain indicated the events were challenging while wearing the oxygen mask.

Brake accumulator had bled to zero, and Y hydraulic level indicated zero, so I felt the safest course was to have ARFF standing by at the rollout end of the landing Runway. Dispatch [requested priority handling] and arranged for ARFF in ZZZ, stating the nature of the malfunction and that we anticipated a normal landing and rollout. Dispatch also notified station operations that we would keep ENG 1 running upon parking at the Gate until the aircraft was chocked. Maintence contacted Station Operations to coordinate maintenance. I briefed the Flight Attendants, electing not to do a cabin prep. We planned the long Runway, XX. Weather in ZZZ was CAVU. Approach, landing, and taxi in were normal. We advised ATC, upon clearing the Runway, that no assistance was needed.				Captain reported a HYD Y RSVR LO LVL ECAM in cruise. The flight crew continued to destination and landed normally.

I transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer and started the low oil quantity QRH procedure. This led us into the engine low oil pressure QRH. We did not yet meet the criteria to perform an intentional shutdown because the oil pressure was not in the red yet. I contacted dispatch via the crew phone app and had them patch me to maintenance to consult on the issue. While on the phone the oil pressure began to drop in and out of the red. We then discontinued the call to complete the QRH for engine shutdown. While on the phone dispatch did advise that ZZZ1 and ZZZ2 were the two closest airports and provided the weather at each. The weather at the time was rain in ZZZ2 and clear in ZZZ1 so I advised dispatch we would be proceeding to ZZZ1. We completed the QRH for engine shutdown and then advised ATC of the [urgent] condition. While I was on the phone with dispatch the First Officer and advised ATC we may have to divert and that we had the oil issue. He had also already looked at our single engine altitude. We requested FL220 and descended. ATC cleared us direct to ZZZ1. In the descent, I completed the QRH for one engine inoperative landing and the Non-Routine Landing Considerations. I advised both the cabin crew and the passengers we would be making a precautionary landing in ZZZ1. I then took the flight controls back from the First Officer.We continued to ZZZ1 and requested vectors to the ILS XX. We conducted the ILS in VFR conditions to a landing without incident. Safety vehicles inspected the aircraft on the runway and escorted us to the gate. Once at the gate we contacted Dispatch and maintenance to advise them of our status. No significant factors other than a loss of oil. No suggestions for the event however coordination of the deadhead flights for the crew was a bit scattered. Just better coordination between the Chief Pilots and scheduling on the status of the crew. In addition I was given almost this exact scenario on my Line Operating Experience (LOE) for my type ride as a Captain and that experience was very helpful in this event.				An Air Carrier Captain reported loss of oil pressure in one engine caused them to shut down the engine and divert to a nearby airport.

Shortly after, I assumed control of the aircraft and radios, while the Captain started QRH procedures for Engine low quantity.During the QRH process, I informed ZZZ Center of an impending engine shut down due to loss of oil pressure and will keep ATC advised; I also used the FMC to calculate an engine out drift down altitude of 22,000 ft. The Captain then reached out to Maintenance Control for guidance as the current aircraft conditions did not meet QRH procedures for a precautionary shut down. During this time, Captain has asked me to start looking for a diversion airfield; I referenced Jeppesen charts for suitable fields and after asking ATC for help in obtaining the current weather and runway in use, I elected ZZZZ as the prime candidate since it also had medical and company presence. Shortly after, we resumed QRH procedures as the oil pressure indications continued to drop from amber to red, resulting in an inflight shutdown. The Captain and I agreed ZZZZ was the best suitable, and after coordination with dispatch, the captain [requested priority handling] and we changed routing to ZZZZ. ATC cleared us to descend to 22,000 ft. initially and I trimmed the aircraft for the descent and slowed the aircraft to 280 kts. to give us additional time to complete all checklists; I also set up the approach in the FMC while the Captain addressed the cabin crew of the issue and informed the passengers of the diversion.After the Captain finished his tasks, I informed him of the speed, and trim setting and transferred control of the aircraft to him; we also briefed the approach (flap override, higher descent rate, go-around considerations etc.) As the aircraft descended lower, I called the cabin crew to check if all is fully seated, cooled the cabin further and briefed them on ETA and flight conditions.Upon contacting ZZZZ Approach/ATC, we were given a different approach and unfavorable vectors, we requested the ILS XX and informed them our intentions of widened and delayed turns. The aircraft was stable on the path outside the FAF and landed with a full stop on the Runway. While the Captain addressed the passengers over the PA, I informed ATC to let emergency vehicles approach and inspect right side of the aircraft. After we received the thumbs up from Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) ground personnel, we taxied the aircraft to the gate and deplaned the passengers. After approval from the Chief Pilot, we returned to the flight deck and assisted ground personnel in towing the aircraft off the gate, to parking it at an Apron and shut it down completely. I was well rested for the sequence and was alert; the Captain was great in directing and keeping everyone informed. The flight deck and cabin crew had excellent CRM leading to the safe outcome of the flight. QRH dictates to verify Oil pressure to drop below red line before proceeding to inflight shut-down; the time it takes can delay decision making.

It was not on our planning paperwork. Reading the deferral there was no pilot action required. Maintenance had put aft outflow valve in manual position with deferred sticker next to it. We took note and assumed switch position was correct for deferral. During climb noticed cabin climbing rapidly. At 10000 ft. Master caution went off, cabin altitude above 10000 ft. Pilot Flying (PF) Immediately with ATC permission descended below 10000 ft. Captain called Maintenance Control and he read deferral. The Captain suggested we put switch in auto position and Maintenance Control did not approve. We manually closed aft valve which brought cabin down. Masks never deployed. We took delay vectors while talking to Dispatch. [Requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ, opting to land overweight instead of dumping fuel. Took our time ran all checklist and landed 5000 pounds overweight. Landing uneventful.		Arrived at Aircraft X for the Day 0 flight from ZZZ to ZZZZ, 1 hour prior to push. I met a mechanic at door 2L who was coming out. I asked if he was working an issue. He advised his colleague had just deferred the aft pressurization outflow valve and the new Maintenance Release was on its way. This condition was not included in the pre-flight paperwork, so it was a surprise to us. I jumped in the right seat and started my setup, noticing the AFT OUTFLOW valve switch was in MAN and had a deferral sticker above it. The Maintenance Release printed while I was setting up, so I handed it to the Captain as I continued loading the FMC and organizing the cockpit for departure. When the International Relief Officer (IRO) returned from the walk-around, the three of us conferred about the outflow valve, noting maintenance had left the switch in MAN and reading through the Maintenance Release deferral noted there was no pilot crew action required.Ground ops proceeded normally and we departed on Runway XXR via the ZZZZZ departure. During climb to 14000 ft., the Captain noted the cabin pressure was climbing, approaching 11000 ft. We briefly experienced the CABIN PRESSURE WARNING and quickly coordinated for a descent back to 10000 ft. (Passenger masks did NOT drop). The Captain directed myself to continuing flying and take the ATC radios while he and the IRO worked the problem. The Captain contacted Dispatch via sat comm and looped in Maintenance Control. I was working the ATC radio and flying, so was not directly listening to their conversation. I do recall the Captain asking  Maintenance Control if we should place the AFT OUTFLOW switch back to AUTO, which they did not approve. I believe they intimated that something with the deferral was amiss and a return to ZZZ was advisable.The Captain continued coordinating with Dispatch and Maintenance Control regarding a return to base while the IRO worked communication with the Flight Attendants, informed passengers of our intentions and monitored my flying. ATC was vectoring us around at 10000 ft. while we worked the issue. We were 20000 pounds over max landing weight so I asked ATC for a location to dump fuel. After a delay and some coordination they responded they could not approve a fuel dump unless we were [requesting priority handling]. The Captain then came on the radio and [requested priority with ATC]. ATC then sent us to the ZZZZZ fix for holding and descended us to 5000 ft., but said nothing about approval to dump fuel. Re-configuring for a ZZZ return, completing checklists/coordination and starting the APU helped us burn sufficient fuel whereby we decided to land slightly overweight (5000 pounds) instead of dumping fuel given our height AGL and ATC's apparent confusion regarding fuel dump approval. Approach and landing to Runway XXC were uneventful and fire trucks escorted us back to gate, where we transitioned to a new tail and pressed ahead to get the passengers to ZZZZ.		B777 flight crew reported departing with a deferred outflow valve. On climb, the cabin altitude began climbing rapidly. The flight crew descended and performed an air turn back to make a precautionary landing at departure airport.

I responded to ATC. However, the Captain was in the middle of finding out his HUD was inoperative. He made the turn but did not dial in the altitude in the MCP window. He realized that he had not put an altitude in the MCP panel and queried me what the altitude was. Unfortunately, I told him the wrong altitude of 7000 ft. We were both heads up at that time, looking for the proceeding aircraft turning final. Leveling off at 7000 ft., I had a feeling something was not right. At that point, ATC issued an Altitude Alert and told us to climb back to 8000 ft. We climbed back to 8000 ft., turned final and intercepted the localizer and landed.Several things where big contributors. I was tired. I had been working PM trips then switched to a early AM wakeup call. After the event, I called in fatigued. Possibly recognizing my night of poor rest, I should have called in fatigued earlier. Second the failure of us not following our standards in setting the MCP panel.  I should have queried ATC again to verify our altitude when I realized the Captain did not know what it was. Last, the Captain was tasked saturated with dealing with the inoperative HUD. This definitely was an added distraction and we both should have been more aware of it interfering with tasks at hand.		While on downwind I was trying to get the HUD to work when we were given turn to base and descend clearance at the same time. I heard the turn while I was extending a line in the FMS for final and asked what the altitude was, my FO (First Officer) thought it was seven thousand but wasn't sure. Typical approach in ZZZ was talking so much and so fast we couldn't get a verification. I looked at the FAF fix and saw 7000 ft. and figured that was the clearance. Approach then called us and advised the clearance was 8000 ft. and climb back to 8000 ft. and we complied and continued the approach with no further incident.Distractions with the HUD, ZZZ Approach speaking so fast and so much were certainly additive conditions. Its very hard to continually track ZZZ and all of their clearances. Insist on verification of clearance. Take some of the load of the PF, like requiring the Pilot Monitoring to do all radio and FMS programing while below 10,000 ft., or all the time for that matter. That way, the Pilot Flying can concentrate on flying the aircraft and listen better to ATC clearances.		Air Carrier flight crew reported receiving an ATC low altitude alert during approach. The flight crew immediately climbed to assigned altitude and continued the approach.

Was told it was an ERJ and they kept our spacing tight all the way into the arrival. We were on base to Runway 10R for the LOC Y 10R approach. We were at 210 then told to turn to a heading and intercept the 10R localizer. Upon intercepting the localizer we were set up the approach for the 10R localizer using VNAV. We were told to slow to 170 and contact Tower at Flynn. [We selected] the gear down to begin slowing. With the increased workload of joining the approach neither of us could confirm if we were to be 170 or a faster speed to Flynn . Going from 210 to a slower speed while in VNAV path and gear down the plane was having difficulty slowing so we went flaps 15. Approach was very busy, and we couldn't get a word in with Approach to confirm so we changed to Tower at Kevnn for landing clearance and we asked if they wanted 170 and were told whatever TRACON told us. We were told to go back to Approach and we changed over we told Approach we were slowing to 170 to Flynn since it looked like we were gaining on the aircraft ahead. They said 'Roger' and put us back to Tower. We then continued to slow and went to flap 40 ref speed of 143 that we had briefed because of the shorter runway and to allow more spacing with the aircraft ahead of us since we were very close the whole way in. We then got landing clearance again and landed with no issues.				B737NG Captain reported a speed deviation approaching ORD, citing communication difficulties and spacing concerns as contributing.

There was a heavy B777 in front of us about 5 miles, there were low level cloud build ups, heavy rain, turbulence in and around airport. While descending approximately between 7000 and 6000 ft., airplane was about 220 kts, we hit what was either wake turbulence or possibly wind shear, the speed started to decrease below 0 flap maneuver speed. FO (First Officer) and Observer simultaneously called 'Airspeed.' Captain aggressively advanced thrust levers to recover airspeed. Aircraft was descending to assigned altitude, slowing to 0 flap maneuver speed, we got a slight upset in aircraft, AP (Autopilot) engaged, ATS (Air Turbine Starter) engaged, on heading 250 in FLCH, we got momentary stick shaker 1 to 2 seconds. After thrust levers manually advanced, airspeed settled back down, we had a momentary climb. However, clearance was to descend to 6000 ft., and we hadn't gotten there yet. Aircraft was returned to stable, no deviations from clearance, no course deviation, ATC was advised we flew through possible wind shear. Aircraft was landed with no further incident.Cause to be determined. [Possible] heavy gross weight aircraft operating at 0 flap maneuver speed, in trail of another Heavy [aircraft], flying in or around moderate rain showers, gusty conditions, possibly wind shear, possible wake turbulence. ATC slowing all traffic due to heavy rain on airport. Possibly too slow for weight of aircraft with the current conditions. ATC held our aircraft high on downwind due departing traffic, then basically wanted us to expedite descent but also slow to 0 flap speed.Captain could have requested higher speed, but unlikely due to following other heavy. Captain could have extended flaps to increase stall margin. However, 30 to 40 miles from airport is not typically where flaps are extended. Maybe Captain could have been less aggressive with adding thrust. However since descending, in Hold, FLCH, ATS was too slow in respond. Since it was possibly wake turbulence, or wind shear, [had to] perform recovery, which Captain did, correct any flight path deviations, which were minimal, notify ATC as Pilot Monitoring did, remain calm, USE specific training, continue calm, land safely, fill out report.		Heading into HKG in gusty and rainy conditions, we had been cleared and were descending from 9000 to 6000 [ft.], airspeed reduction to 220 kts, so the PF (Pilot Flying) had the speedbrake engaged and we experienced some kind of windshear, possibly combined with wake turbulence from an aircraft we were following which caused a quick momentary drop in our airspeed and a brief stall warning of about a second or two, which the PF corrected for with thrust levers forward and parked the speedbrake. The PF then got us back on a descending path towards assigned altitude. The PM (Pilot Monitoring) notified ATC that we had a slight windshear and temporary climb during the correction because of the increased power, but we were already continuing our assigned descent altitude of 6000 ft. We were eventually cleared for an approach to a normal landing, no further incidents or problems.To increase the stall margin in the existing conditions, suggestion would be that the PF could have extended flaps, even though we were still quite a distance from where we would normally configure, or possibly we could have requested a higher descent speed.		Air Carrier B777 flight crew reported a speed deviation and stick shaker occurred on approach to HKG in gusty conditions. Wind shear and/or wake turbulence were cited as possible contributors.

MSL, the First Officer (FO) engaged autopilot B as it was his leg. Shortly after engaging, the aircraft rolled sharply to the right. Approximately 30 degrees bank in 1 second. The autopilot then disengaged. The FO recovered the aircraft, and when it was stable again, he attempted to re-engage the autopilot again using autopilot B. The aircraft did the same sharp roll to the right. He recovered again, and hand flew. We discussed trying autopilot A, but decided that we would not. We did not want a 3rd repeat of the event as we believed it was extremely uncomfortable to the passengers and Flight Attendants. We then discussed whether we felt we should continue to ZZZ2. Being an ETOPS flight and we had not yet reached the shoreline, neither of us felt we should continue. I thought we should get another opinion, so I called Dispatch via SATCOM and had Dispatch patch us through to the Flight Operations Duty Officer (FODO). The FO flew the airplane and leveled off at FL250. Upon talking to the FODO and explaining our situation, the FODO agreed with us that we should return to ZZZ1 hand flying the aircraft. The FO flew got vectors back to the ZZZZZ arrival to ZZZ1 while I managed the situation. We decided it was normal operation to hand fly to ZZZ1 as there were no adverse reactions from the plane without the autopilot engaged. We landed overweight in ZZZ1 without incident. Our landing weight was approximately 163200 pounds and touchdown less than 500 FPM. Upon returning to the gate, maintenance was there to meet us and ran some tests. They said that FCC B had completely failed and Aileron Actuator 2 had failed. We swapped into a new plane and continued safely to ZZZ2. This event affected safety, but overall, I was happy with how we handled it. I believe we covered all bases before making the decision to divert. Overall, I'm happy with how we handled the situation. We discussed the situation among ourselves and added Dispatch and the FODO into the conversation. We briefed the Flight Attendants and passengers and ultimately made a safe and conservative decision. We then made a safe flight to ZZZ2 in a new aircraft.				B737-800 Captain reported loss of aircraft control and autopilot disengagement while in cruise. An attempt to reengage the autopilot resulted in the same event. The flight crew returned to departure airport.

The flight was unremarkable throughout cruise at FL410. We started a descent approximately 130 NM west of ZZZ1. With both engines near idle, passing through FL280 (approximately 85 NM west of ZZZ1), we noted the RT A/P disconnect and an ELEC illuminate on the SYS ANNUNCIATION PNL and the RT GEN DRIVE illuminate on the OVHD. The First Officer (FO) stated 'I think we lost the generator'. I asked him to start the APU. As I fed in left rudder, I looked at the UPPER ENG Display; an ENG FAIL was annunciation over the RT EGT. I stated, 'I think we lost the engine' and disconnected the auto-throttles. After the APU was running, the FO put the right APU generator switch on the busses. We turned to the engine and noted an auto-start was in progress. The RT Engine restarted on its own and at idle all indications were normal. We discussed the flame out and restart event. We elected to leave the right engine at idle and configure for a precautionary single engine landing at Flaps 15. The FO completed the One Engine Approach/Landing Checklist. We advised ATC that engine had flamed-out but was now restarted. We decided not to [request priority handling] and did not ask for traffic priority. With winds from the north, we asked for and received the ILS Runway XX into ZZZ1. We completed the approach and landing at flaps 15 with the right engine in idle. I elected to use reverse thrust only on the left engine. We taxied to the south end of the ramp and were met by maintenance and shutdown. Post flight inspection revealed no visible damage to the right engine. Company department management, Dispatch and Maintenance Control were briefed on the incident.		I was the Pilot Monitoring (PM) on Aircraft X which was a non-revenue flight to ferry a former 737NG from ZZZ to ZZZ1 for final disposal. The flight was being operated under a Special Airworthiness Certificate. Brief, Preflight, and climb were all nominal for the transit. About 110nm from ZZZ1 on a descent from 41,000 ft. while passing 28,000 ft. with engines at idle the autopilot B system kicked off. At that time, I announced looking at the initial blue lights on the overhead panel that the #2 generator had come offline, and we commenced APU startup. Simultaneously while the APU was starting up, the pilot flying started to have to feed in trim and announced we lost the #2 Engine. That timeline from initial autopilot off to announcing #2 engine had failed was about 7 seconds. Engine display instruments indicated Eng Fail where the #2 engine EGT is normally displayed. About 30 seconds after the initial autopilot kickoff, we noted the #2 engine had auto restarted as designed. Naturally as this was going on, we had an ATC switchover and once we checked in with the new ATC frequency we notified them we had an engine flameout which had restarted and there was no assistance required at this time. We continued our descent to final destination of ZZZ1, while doing so, I as the PM, ran the Engine Fail checklist. As a crew we decided it was best to leave the #2 engine at idle and plan for a precautionary flaps 15 approach to ZZZ1. I continued to run the non-normal landing distance calculation for 1 engine inoperative to ensure we had adequate distance to land if the engine quit as well as run the one engine inoperative landing non-normal. We also communicated that if we had any other anomalies in the descent we would [request priority handling] but as the aircraft had no system anomalies and the engine was operating adequately at idle no assistance was required and as ZZZ1 is a small regional airport there was no other traffic in the vicinity so priority was not an issue. Landing conditions were a 91k aircraft gross weight (no pax nor cargo), engines had been re-rated at 24k for the flight, and a good 12 kt headwind we concluded aircraft performance was not a factor should a single engine scenario develop.		B737-700 Flight Crew reported autopilot problems and an uncommanded in flight shut down of the right engine during a ferry flight of an aircraft scheduled for dis-assembly. The engine restarted on it's own, so the flight crew continued to destination airport and landed.

The Flight Attendants notified us they heard a banging sound coming from the right side of the aircraft. The right engine slowly returned to match the left engine but fluctuated +/- 2% N1. We made the decision to divert to ZZZ after being notified about the noise heard from the cabin. On the descent the right engine was slow to respond with thrust changes. We made the decision to request priority handling and landed at ZZZ on Runway XXC flaps 40. On landing using thrust reversers the right engine again responded slowly and had a slight change in asymmetry. Roll-out was uneventful and the safety vehicles followed us to the Gate. Using everyone from the First Officer, cabin crew, ATC and the Company, the flight diverted successfully to ZZZ uneventful. I credit CRM training which led to a successful outcome of the event.		As we were climbing through 350 to our cruise altitude of 360, we heard several loud bangs in the back, felt the aircraft shudder, and noted that our number 2 N1 had rolled back to about 40%. The flight attendants quickly called up and confirmed they and the passengers had heard the same thing. The thrust slowly came back up on the N1. We decided to divert to ZZZ, request priority handling, and land. We made it to ZZZ without further incident.

We noticed a rapid fuel loss of left main tank. We ran QRH and we suspected a fuel leak, that lead us to the QRH and the subsequent shut down of the #1 engine. We ran QRH for single engine landing and appropriate checklists for the single engine landing. During approach the Pilot Monitoring told me she lost electric pitch trim and I verified that by trying my side. We were at 4,000 ft. and about to join the localizer, we said running the pitch trim QRH would of been unsafe and I manually trimmed for her. We continued the approach and landed safely. Fuel imbalance indication with rapid loss of left tank fuel indication.		'We departed ZZZ at XA24z and climbed to FL390, I was the Flying Pilot. While climbing through FL280 we noticed a fuel imbalance in the left main tank. Fuel was rapidly decreasing from approx. 8.6 to 6.79 within about 5 min. We consulted the QRH chapter FUEL IMBALANCE, which directed us to QRH FUEL LEAK with subsequent shutdown of the left engine. We requested priority handling, requested descent and vectors back to ZZZ. Dispatch was notified via ACARS. We prepared the aircraft for a single engine landing according to QRH and were cleared for Runway XXL. Since XXL has not other guidance than the PAPI, we requested ILS XXR sidestep XXL. During vectors to final at 4,000 ft. we also noticed a sudden failure of the primary pitch trim, and the aircraft had to be trimmed manually by the Pilot Monitoring First Officer. Since trim was manageable and we were already on vectors to final, the pitch trim was not addressed via the QRH, discussed and confirmed by both pilots. Hand flying the aircraft, we continued the approach and ended the flight with a successful and smooth landing on Runway XXL. Tower and Company were notified that we needed a tow back to the Ramp since our policy does not provide for single engine taxi. Fuel imbalance in left main tank observed, rapidly decreasing fuel, proceeded according to QRH see above.		B737-800 flight crew reported a fuel imbalance in flight.

Lots of weather and terrain to the west of our position. I requested a right turn, but he quickly said no, turn left immediately. So we did. We were cleared down to 8000 ft. Then he said turn left to a heading of 140 and descend to 5000 ft. The new Captain and I both pointed to 5000 in the altitude window and verbalized the assigned altitude. While passing through 5600 ft., the controller said to climb and maintain 6000 ft. and that there was a terrain warning. So we did. We were cleared for the approach and landed Runway XX. After landing we were told to call TRACON because of a possible altitude violation. 5000 ft. is low for ZZZ, but the altitude at ZZZZZ1 is 5100, so I thought that was a MVA altitude to get us under the rain so we could do a visual approach. We are human and sometimes make mistakes, but both of us really believe we heard and read back 5000 ft.Being held up way too high on a vector with lots of weather in the area. Several changes in altitudes and initial approach fixes to join the approach. This was a distraction.Approach offering other options after keeping us held up so high. I've had this happen several times over the years in ZZZ. We even talked about the possibility in our briefing of the approach at cruise.		During the descent to ZZZ, we were assigned a late descent, to cross ZZZZZ at or above 8000 ft. and clear the ILS XX approach. Due to the multiple cells and a very deep descent rate, we asked for a north deviation. A clearance to deviate to the north was approved, followed by a clearance to descend to 8000 ft. Once our altitude was not a factor, we were given a south heading, to what we replied, that we wanted to continue on the north deviation. Controller replied that he was unable, and we were told to turn left to a 180 heading. As we tuned to the south, we were cleared to a further left turn, to a 140 heading and 5000 ft. to intercept the XX localize. Descending through 5600 ft., we were told that our last assigned altitude was 6000 ft. We stopped the descent and climb back up to 6000 ft. At that point we were given a clearance of, 140 heading, 6000 until establish and clear for the ILS XX.Convective weather, late descent clearance, followed by a multiple clearances that included different way-points, headings, and altitudesSuggestion: A better descent profile to the airport.		Air Carrier Check Airman and new Captain reported misunderstanding ATC and descending below the assigned altitude. The pilots stated the weather was poor, the descent clearance was late and delay vectors were being used to help with the descent.

The Captain requested the trucks to meet us on landing. The Captain then informed company, Flight Attendants (FAs) and passengers. On return to ZZZ, we prepared for an overweight landing of 135,000 lbs. On approach we experienced an uncommanded roll left/right at 2,500 ft. [with the] autopilot on. On touchdown the 'Takeoff Config' light illuminated. After thorough inspection by Airport Rescue and Firefighting we got the green light ('All Safe') and continued taxing to the gate.

Myself and the Captain arrived at the plane on time and proceeded to accomplish our duties that night. Everything was setup and double checked as appropriate followed by the corresponding checklist as well as the walk around. We pushed off the gate and continued to the runway without any issue. I made sure the flaps were set to 1 for takeoff. The rudder and aileron trims were also set and checked before takeoff. The Tower cleared us for takeoff, at which point controls were transferred to me since this was my leg to fly. The aircraft proceeded down the runway straight with little need for correction until rotation. Once the aircraft started to climb there was a gradual bank to the left that I began correcting with right aileron and small amount of rudder. It continued to get worse with the aircraft banking farther left as we climbed and speed increased. At first I thought it must have been very strong crosswind after takeoff but realized after looking at center display unit there was no wind. As we continued to climb I tried to adjust the bank with aileron inputs and trimming. I mentioned to Captain that the inputs are more than normal and to check to see if I was missing anything. The Captain then mentioned that it did feel a bit unusual in his seat with the aircraft feeling out of trim. At this time we decided to level off to further work the issue. The yoke at this time was indicating 7 on the aileron trim on the right side in order to accomplish straight and level. As speed started to increase, so did the need for more aileron. We immediately reduced the speed to 250 kts. to lessen the correction since we would be approaching the maximum input of right aileron if it continued. We transferred controls to see if it was something on the FO (First Officer) side malfunctioning. The Captain had the same issue and could not correct it. We then transferred controls back and began to look for an indication or something that could be the issue. There were no lights illuminated indicating a problem, so we started to look to see if we could find it on our own. We looked at flaps/slats, landing gear, trim settings, spoilers, speed brakes as well as all of the fluid levels like hydraulics. We could not find anything that was indicating the incorrect position or setting. The Captain then went through the QRH to find a checklist that would apply. Again nothing applied to the banking the plane wanted to do. We talked about diverting and what else we needed to do. The Captain contacted Dispatch, Maintenance, the fleet manager and Chief Pilot to see if they could help. They walked us through a few trimming ideas and had us double check system indications which did not fix the problem. We all then decided to [request priority handling] and head to ZZZ2. ZZZ2 was straight ahead and had long enough runways to land overweight. We descended at a slow rate and continued to Runway XXL. The Captain setup the FMS and corresponding instruments, we briefed the approach and completed all checklists. We transferred controls one last time so the Captain could land the aircraft. After putting in flaps, gear and slowing down the speed, we started to feel a slight rumble or vibration sensation in the controls. We were on speed and on the ILS completely stable the entire time. The Captain was able to land the aircraft safely even with the inputs still far to the right. We then taxied to the gate with emergency vehicles following us from behind.				First Officer reported excessive aileron trim was required to maintain controllability. The flight crew diverted to make a precautionary landing.

I spun in the FAF crossing altitude for ZZZZZ, which I thought was 2000 ft., but in reality was 2800 ft. The Approach Controller advised us of a Low Altitude Alert and we climbed back up to 2800 ft., and intercepted the glideslope for a stable and safe landing. We were both so fixated on the close in traffic, that we didn't catch the wrong altitude in the Mode Control Panel window.Suggestion: Better monitoring of the MCP and [other equipment] between Crew Members.		We were behind a 757 to Runway XXL and were high to get sequenced in, behind it. As we turned to final and were cleared visual, we still felt high and close to our interval. Pilot Flying (PF) extended off of ZZZZZ in FMS and put 2000 instead of 2800 into Mode Control Panel (MCP). Pilot monitoring (PM) got focused on distance to 757 and did not crosscheck. ATC called us to check altitude. Climbed to 2800 ft. and made safe landing.Suggestion: Pay better attention in the brief to help with FAF altitude crosscheck.		A Flight Crew reported they descended 800 ft. below the Final Approach Fix altitude and received a Low Altitude Alert from ATC.

On the third incident the wing dipped at least 15 degrees and the autopilot kicked off. The First Officer (FO) immediately made a PA for the Flight Attendants (FA) to be seated. We reduced speed after returning to level flight and inquired from ATC about what type of aircraft we were following. It was a 737 MAX. After ensuring no one was affected in the cabin the FA were told to prepare for landing and the flight continued uneventfully to SFO.	Reporter stated he was surprised at the intensity of the wake.	Descending via DYAMD5 arrival, we experienced moderate wake turbulence from approx FL250 to FL230.  Aircraft rolled approx 15 deg AOB right and autopilot disengaged. PF rolled wings level and reengaged autopilot after wake turbulence cleared. PM seated FAs during turbulence. ATC was notified. We were following B737 MAX 9 approx 7 miles in trail.

It was yawing to the left. I could feel resistance on the peddles and I thought it may have been the Captain's feet. I found out later it was not him. Right after bringing the gear up on takeoff, we got an ECAM caution message about the nose wheel steering. I can't remember the exact message. I called 'my aircraft' and focused on flying and radios while the Captain ran the checklists. We determined that the nose wheel steering was INOP. But we didn't know the position of the gear, whether straight or at a 90 degree angle. We wouldn't know until we lowered the gear. Either way, we made the decision to request priority handling and make a full stop landing in ZZZ. We requested ARFF be waiting for us. The Captain made the appropriate calls to Dispatch and Maintenance. He alerted the Flight Attendants and made the PAs to the passengers. I requested priority handling with ATC and gave them the requested information. It was a very short flight so things were moving fast. We decided to get the gear out early to see if there were any additional ECAM messages. Thankfully, there were not. We determined the nose gear was straight and that we would make a normal landing to a full stop on XXL in ZZZ. We touched down and came to a stop without incident. Crash, Fire, and Rescue was standing by. They inspected the aircraft for damage and found none. We handed them the gear pins and a push crew towed us to the Gate.				A320 First Officer reported on the takeoff roll they noticed it was difficult to keep the aircraft on center line. The flight crew elected to continue to destination airport, requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing.

ZZZ-ZZZ1. During approach to XXL at 8,000 ft., cleared for the approach with the APPR psb armed (right around ZZZZZ), we received an ECAM for Engine 2 EGT over limit. Looking at the EGT, we had both recognized that it was in the red over 800*C. Captain commanded ECAM actions to which I had began running. It had us reduce engine 2 thrust to idle to reduce EGT which caused no change and required us to shutdown engine 2. The ECAM elected us to select engine 2 master off. Captain increased engine 1 thrust lever to MCT. Systems pages showed, to which we went through each to see what systems were effected, followed by reading the status page. Eng anti ice went on and the APU was started. After ECAM actions were complete a request for priority handling was made to ATC and a hold was requested over ZZZZZ1 at our current altitude of 8,000 ft. by Captain as I went into COM 2 to run the procedures for ENG 2 EGT over limit and ENG 2 shutdown. Getting set up in the hold at ZZZZZ1 at some point our altitude became uncaptured putting us in v/s mode. We had been -250 originally and +250 during the first turn before getting the airplane to capture 8000 ft. on the outbound leg. While I was running the COM Captain called the lead Flight Attendant to give a brief, sent an ACARS message to Dispatch, contacted ZZZ1 ops, took ATC commands and requested emergency vehicles to stand by for landing. The COM instructed for the cross bleed switch to be in the open position if performance permitted. I should have kept this in auto due to high terrain for the possibility of a go-around. After the COM was complete I had taken over ATC communication and requested our approach for the ILS XXL. As we started the approach I told the passengers we would have them on the ground in approximately 5 minutes and to remain seated with seat belts fastened. Upon landing, 'spoilers' 'reverse green' and 'decel' were called. '70 kts.' was called. Upon coming to a stop simultaneously I informed ATC we were stopping on the Runway while Captain set the parking brake and called for 'flight attendant stations'. The firetrucks did an inspection to which nothing abnormal was found. Captain announced 'remain seated remain seated remain seated'. I then asked ATC for taxi instructions back to the Gate. Emergency vehicles followed us to the Gate. Once parked and the jet bridge pulled up we were met by a Firefighter and Maintenance to which a logbook entry was made and phone calls made to both dispatch and a Chief Pilot.				A320 First Officer reported receiving an ECAM for Engine 2 EGT over limit. A go-around was performed and the flight crew ran the QRH and check lists. Priority handling was requested, the affected engine was shut down and a precautionary landing was performed at destination airport.

ATC provided additional services for our visual approach into [Runway] XXR. On the ground fire rescue evaluated the exterior condition and found no anomalies. We were met at the gate by fire and rescue to verify there was no on going fire risk. Within 15 minutes of landing we had the passengers deplane normally. We provided the accounts of the situation to maintenance of the reported odor and overweight landing. We both felt we were able to continue with the day and did so with no other events with a new aircraft.				B737-800 First Officer reported a fumes event during climb.

We returned to ZZZ and completed an overweight landing. Our intention was to taxi to a gate, however we were instructed to taxi to the penalty box. We deplaned the passengers and the FO (Flight Officer) and flight attendants were taken to the hospital for observation and released.The cause was a 32 ounce bottle of toxic chemical was allowed to board the aircraft.Make sure TSA checks passenger luggage.

This was set into the MCP and loaded into the FMC while in VNAV. The legs page had a discontinuity between the abeam points in front of Goatz and Goatz, which we closed. At some point in the process, the 16000 restriction at Goatz dropped out of the FMC and neither pilot noticed. Consequently VNAV was programming a descent to the point beyond Goatz (also at 16000 ft.), and by the time we realized it, we were much too high to make the restriction at Goatz. Center was notified and seemed OK with it.While being vectored to Runway 25L by SoCal Approach we were instructed to descend to 2600 ft. At the time we were east of Gaate which has an altitude restriction of 5000 ft. This seemed low, so we asked ATC to confirm the altitude, which he did. We were then cleared for the ILS 25L, but were planning and told to expect the RNAV Y. We corrected the Controller and were subsequently cleared the RNAV Y. 2600 ft. put us below all of the altitude restrictions outside the FAF and seemed too low for our position so we did a slow descent to 3600 and intercepted the VNAV path at Hunda (3600 alt restriction), hence not fully complying with the descent to 2600 ft.The vectors to final were given to us because we were following a heavy 787. We were approximately 6NM in trail of the 787 just prior to the FAF Gigli when the aircraft began to turn left. Both pilots assumed this was LNAV programing a turn for some reason and we focused on the displays. The aircraft continued the left roll and we received a 'bank angle' caution, at which point we called 'upset', disconnected the autopilot and auto throttles and recovered the aircraft without incident. The assumption was that we hit wake turbulence from the 787, so we reconnected the automation and continued the approach landing beyond the approach path of the 787 but within 3000 of the TDZ.		Missed crossing restriction--plus non standard ATC clearance on approach. Additionally a wake turbulence event on final approach.In ZZZ I loaded the ILS to 25L. Upon viewing the ATIS within ACARS range of LAX I changed the approach to the RNAV Y 25L. When we checked in with LA Center he issued the GOATZ arrival with a non published crossing restriction of 16,000 ft. at GOATZ. The CA (Captain) hard coded the altitude at GOATZ and I confirmed. At some point either before TOD or after beginning our descent the CA realized that there was a discontinuity somewhere in the arrival. He closed the disconnect. While in the descent I was monitoring the VPI and we were in VNAV SPD initially as the automation was slow to begin the descent. About 400 ft. high and still no trend towards VNAV PTH I selected the speed brakes. We were back on path prior to GOATZ. However neither one of us realized that the FMS had deleted the hard coding at GOATZ and was heading for the published 19000-16000 ft. at DIRBY. We did not realize this until about 4 miles prior to GOATZ when both of us saw that we were going to be very high. We notified ATC that we were high, he acknowledged that and we crossed GOATZ at about FL230. We continued rapidly descending and resumed the rest of the arrival as published and instructed by ATC. I am not sure why they do it, but in addition to the non-published crossing at GOATZ, we were issued several descend via but maintain altitudes during the rest of the arrival with LA Approach. They very rarely allow us to fly the arrival as published. This can cause a lot of threats and with the constant threat of the VNAV on the 737, all the changes can result in problems. Unrelated to the altitude deviation above approach issued a strange altitude clearance while on approach to the RNAV Y 25L. We told to fly a heading of 010 out of SLI for spacing behind a 747 (turned out it was a 787). Approach turned us back NW on a vector to join somewhere outside of GAATE. I believe we were at about 5000 ft. ATC cleared us to 2600 ft. We were both questioning that because there is no 2600 ft. published anywhere on the approach. The CA confirmed the altitude with ATC and I selected level change and along with the final turn to join final began descending. As we were on a heading to join the final approach course I reselected both LNAV and VNAV. The airplane descended until reaching 3600 ft. in VNAV PTH. We were outside of GAATE, published 3600 ft. Once the LNAV and VNAV were on track we flew the approach as published in LNAV and PTH. However, just as we both thought the jet was stable on the final approach course, it was very close to the end of its turn to join, it continued to turn left. We both initially thought it was the LNAV getting on course until the turn continued and was leading past the final approach course. About the same time we both asked each other what it was doing the wings started to roll even more to the left. I immediately disconnected the AP and rolled wings level. The CA announced 'Upset', and I went through the upset recovery steps with the exclusion of disconnecting the autothrottle. The event happened so quickly and was also over very quickly once I disconnected the AP that I never got to disconnecting the autothrottles. I did call out the steps and reacted as necessary with the pitch and roll. Once stable we agreed that it was wake from the preceding heavy.I hand flew us back onto the approach until the automation could be re-engaged. LAX was 1200 OVC at the time and per the FM (Flight Manual) the AP had to be on until the runway visual could be maintained. Once we went through the thin marine layer and had the runway clearly in sight, I manually landed uneventfully.		B737NG flight crew reported an upset occurred after encountering wake turbulence on approach to LAX in trail of a B787.

As we were only about one hour from ZZZ with many souls on board, we made the prudent decision out of an abundance of caution to return to ZZZ versus continuing on further away from a safe landing spot. A priority report was made to ZZZ1 (ZZZ Center) and clearance was received to return to ZZZ. We began to dump fuel as to not exceed our maximum landing weight. Checklist were run and we briefed the Flight Attendants, announcements were made to the passengers and contingencies discussed. Arrival, approach and landing were normal. We were met by the fire department upon clearing the Runway, the right engine was shut down and inspected by the fire personnel for any noticeable damage; there was none. As we had been directed to an awkward position on the Taxiway for the fire crews to inspect the engine, we were unable to taxi the aircraft to the Gate and we required a tug to tow us to the Gate. Passengers were disembarked and Maintenance personnel entered the flight deck to ascertain the nature of the problem.

Approximately halfway between ZZZ and ZZZ1, we were advised, by the Flight Attendant, that the forward lav was leaking sewage onto the floor. Sewage then began seeping into the flight deck from under the second jump seat. The First Officers bag was damaged with the sewage spill. Brown sewage was also leaking into the flight deck area behind the center pedestal. We continued into ZZZ1 for an uneventful landing. Maintenance was notified and a logbook entry was made. ZZZ1 Maintenance removed the toilet seat cover to find a leaking line that they were unable to repair. The forward lavatory was locked and deferred per MEL XX-X-XX Lavatory Not Used. About halfway into our next flight, ZZZ1 to ZZZ2, the sewage reappeared in the same areas. The Flight Attendant then called to say the lav smelled horrible and that the aircraft was unsafe to continue on. I agreed and sent a Maintenance Message informing ZZZ2 Maintenance of the issue. We landed safely in ZZZ2 and assumed the aircraft would be grounded. I contacted Maintenance through Dispatch, to tell them the Supervisor on Duty should put in a swap. I met local Maintenance and advised them of a puddle of sewage on the flight deck. I told them it was unsafe for use and they agreed saying, 'We'll take it to the hangar.' Walking to my car, I was contacted on my personal phone by Scheduling, saying I had to call Maintenance Control. I then called Maintenance Control and was told with an attitude that 'I just can't ground an aircraft and walk away, and where's the write-up?' I then replied 'hold on a second,' to which the Controller responded, 'NO YOU HOLD ON A SECOND!'I then told him that I would walk back across the street to write it up. However, it was now on a deferral and had flown around for two days without being repaired, while creating an unsafe environment for passengers and crew. He then said, 'What do you want in the logbook?', to which I replied 'aircraft unsafe for use due to forward lavatory leaking sewage into flight deck area and Flight Attendants report forward lavatory excessive sewage smell' He then hung up. I simply didn't see the need for additional logbook write-ups when Maintenance was literally standing in a pool of sewage in the flight deck. Apparently the previous deferral didn't work. However, the Maintenance Controller was apparently unhappy with me for not re-entering the deferral??? I have never received a personal phone call, while off duty, or been treated so disrespectful, by another employee in my over XX years at this Company. The pressure and coercion to keep aircraft in service is a severe Safety issue to our passengers and crew. The Maintenance Controller should be removed from duty and retrained. Personally contacting a Captain to tell him he can't ground an aircraft without a logbook entry, is promoting a hostile, unsafe work environment. I exercised my Captains authority to provide a safe, hospitable environment for my passengers and crew, by grounding the aircraft. My First Officer and I both returned home from our trips with sewage-laden bags. My bag was subsequently left in the sewage when my First Officer pulled his bag out. The Flight Attendant was required to serve drinks out of a galley adjacent to this lavatory for two flights, thanks to our Maintenance Operation's incompetence. I wrote it up and was in compliance with our MEL procedures. I then followed up to Dispatch and Maintenance Control, only to be met with attitude and told you can't do that. The Company should issue vouchers to the passengers affected on this flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. The Company should offer to replace the First Officer's and Captain's luggage and issue a stipend for belongings damaged.				B737-700 flight crew reported lavatory leaking into cabin and cockpit area.

Shortly after reaching cruise atlitude at FL360 the Captain and I noticed an order which could be described as burning plastic or electrical in nature. The Captain called the flight attendants to ask if they had something in the oven (that may be burning) but they did not, and at the same time the aft flight attendants called about the same smell. We later found out the entire cabin could smell the odor almost simultaneously. I took the aircraft and ATC communications while the Captain accomplished the procedures to address the problem. After accomplishing the checklist the odor had gone away. We considered our options and due to the unknown source of the smell we elected to divert. The nearest suitable field was deemed to be ZZZZ1. The Captain continued coordination with the cabin crew and dispatch while I [advised] ATC and requested vectors to ZZZZ1. The descent and arrival to ZZZZ1 were unremarkable. Emergency vehicles were present and followed the aircraft to the hardstand since there were no abnormal indications in the aircraft requiring immediate assistance. Passengers deplaned uneventfully. No known cause; Maintenance is inspecting the aircraft for the source of the odor.Prevent any odor from filling the aircraft that is from an unknown source.				Air Carrier First Officer reported a fume event during cruise.

There was also a 'STEERING' warning. I broke off the approach and continued over the airport, asking ATC to visually confirm if the doors were open. They so confirmed. We requested delaying vectors while we worked through the ECAM and QRH checklists and attempted to contact Dispatch and/or Maintenance to consult with them. Using all available methods, we were unable to make contact (until later, on the descent into ZZZ). After completing the checklists - and taking note of the tremendous fuel burn associated with flying with the gear doors open - we reviewed our options. We did not think it advisable to land in our present configuration, nor to attempt landing at ZZZ1, when ZZZ was close by. ZZZ has much longer runways, better CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) and more available medical facilities, should they be required. I elected to [advise ATC] and requested a diversion to ZZZ. Upon that decision being made, we raised the gear, climbed to 10,000 ft. and proceeded to ZZZ. Although the gear retracted normally, the 'STEERING' warning remained, which indicated to me that the problem, whatever it was, was not entirely resolved. I briefed the passengers via the PA, and told the FAs (Flight Attendants) to prepare for a precautionary landing in ZZZ. On the approach into ZZZ, we re-extended the gear and as hoped, it extended normally. The 'STEERING' ECAM also disappeared after gear extension. ECAM 'Recall' then indicated 'Normal'. We had planned to fly by the ZZZ Tower for visual inspection, but with the normal indications, we asked Tower for a visual check while we were still on approach and Tower said that all appeared normal to them. We elected to proceed with the landing and were cleared for the option. Landed normally. Nosewheel steering worked normally, so we cleared the runway and had CFR look the aircraft over to make sure there was no visible damage. There was not, so we taxied to the gate. ZZZ Maintenance met the aircraft and electronically confirmed the previous gear malfunction. The aircraft was taken out of service by ZZZ Maintenance.Mechanical and/or electronic failure, possibly transient in natureI would like to know why the 'Crew Phone' did not work on this aircraft; why we were unable to contact Dispatch or Maintenance Control.

Very shortly after turning off the center pumps we noticed we had a fuel imbalance of about 1,100 pounds. We decided to level off so that we could figure out what was going on. The left tank was 1,100 pounds off of the right and was noticeably decreasing quickly. We decided to run the QRH for the imbalance, which eventually led us to shutting down the engine per the checklist. ZZZ was our chosen divert airport due to its proximity. Single engine landing was uneventful and smooth. Flight proceeded normally otherwise. We had the proper amount of fuel at takeoff. Once the engine was secured the leak appeared to stop. The Captain asked the Flight Attendants to look out the window for a leak, but they were unable to confirm it.		We took off uneventfully with 19.1 of fuel from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. In the climb, passing approximately 24000 ft. and just a few minutes after turning the center tank pumps off, we got an IMBAL indication on the fuel gauges. The imbalance was approximately 1,100 pounds and getting worse as the decrease in the #1 tank was noticeably greater than that of the #2 tank. We leveled out and assessed the situation, and the imbalance continued to increase. We asked the Flight Attendants to scan the wing. They saw nothing. We referenced the QRH IMBAL then Fuel Leak Engine Checklists. We had an IMBAL Indication of 1,100 pounds within approximately 15-20 minutes of flight, which seemed to be increasing rapidly. We shut down the engine in accordance with the QRH Fuel Leak checklist, Passengers and Crew were informed, diverted to ZZZ (nearest suitable) and landed uneventfully.		Flight crew reported they shut down an engine and diverted to the nearest suitable airport due to a fuel leak.

While looking at the quantity indicators and observing a fuel Leak on the NO. 2 tank, plus the MEL leakage history on that fuel tank, I decided that the safest and more conservative course of action would be to [advise ATC] and turn back to ZZZ to make sure we were not leaking an amount of fuel that could create a fire hazard or a fuel starvation situation. We landed on ZZZ uneventfully. While on the runway CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) personnel inspected the aircraft and we noticed both Center Pumps were indicating LOW PRESSURE with 2,300 lbs still left on the center tank. We taxied to the gate uneventfully.Suggestion: Better fleet fuel system maintenance.		When we reviewed the AML we noticed a MELed item referencing a fuel seep/leak from Date 0. I took an extra close look at all fuel related items during the preflight, but didn't see any leaks. We departed and at about 19000 ft. noticed a significant fuel imbalance of 1800 lbs, increasing at a significant rate. The right tank quantity was lower than the left tank. Due to the MEL item and continuing loss of fuel in that tank, we were certain that we had a fuel leak. We [advised ATC] and turned around to land at ZZZ. I started the checklist, communicated with ZZZ ATC, while the Captain retained his Pilot Flying duties and communication with the cabin. Due to the existing MEL item, reports from the cabin and a slowing rate of leaking, we did not assume that the fuel leak was coming from the engine and therefore stopped the checklist prior to the point where the engine had to be shut down. As we started descending, the change in fuel quantity had slowed significantly. The airplane had a tendency to bank to the left due to the imbalance. As we were on final approach the fuel quantity in the right tank stayed constant. We stopped on the runway and received the confirmation from the fire trucks that there was no obvious leak. At that point we noticed that the center fuel tank 'low pressure' lights were on, even though the pumps were on and the center tank quantity at 2300 lbs. We checked the 'fuel used' indication and saw an equal amount of fuel used by both engines. I am not sure what caused this imbalance. I don't have enough systems insight to understand why we could have a decreasing fuel quantity on the right tank only, with 'low pressure' and fuel remaining in the center tank. Maintenance did several tests and when we flew this plane the next day, everything worked normally.		Air Carrier Pilot Crew reported a continuing fuel imbalance during climb out. The pilots stated eventually the imbalance triggered fuel warning indications prompting a return to the origin station. There was an MEL regarding the fuel system on this aircraft.

The First Officer (FO) did not notice the smell. When we began our initial descent into our arrival airport, I believe we leveled off around 26,000 ft., the First Officer asked me if I smelled something. Coincidentally, I noticed the smell at the exact same time he said something. He either smelled it first, or I did not realize I smelled something until he brought it to my attention. We were then given another descent and the odor dissipated before we had time to apply the appropriate procedures. In the descent, we had time to open our manuals to the fume removal procedure as we anticipated possibly another instance on level off. We leveled off around 11,000 ft., but we did not encounter any more odors for the remainder of the flight. Upon arrival at the gate, the First Officer felt dizzy, lightheaded, and possibly had a few other symptoms. The cabin crew did not encounter any indication of an odor in the cabin. I filled out the paper air quality form maintenance personnel requested and I also filled out the digital online form, I notified Dispatch, and I also notified the Chief Pilot on duty per our safety reporting requirements. The online form would not allow me access to the description section. I tried to login to the form twice however, each time I was unable to fill out the description section. I submitted it with the information that it allowed me to input. The First Officer went on to seek an evaluation due to his symptoms.				Air Carrier Captain reported an intermittent fume event during initial climb and again during destination descent which eventually dissipated and did not return. At gate arrival the Captain submitted company reports and First Officer was treated for physiological symptoms.

We [requested priority handling] and requested to stop climb at 3,000 ft. and return to ZZZ. The FO (First Officer) was flying and talking to ATC. The Relief Pilot and I ran the EEC L non normal check list. Then contacted ZZZ Operations to relay our return to Dispatch. We proceeded downwind and continued to run the Non-routine and overweight landing checklists. We decided to land overweight after reviewing the secondary engine instruments which showed nothing abnormal. The FO landed the Aircraft at 604,700 lbs on the longest runway with both engines operating , max reverse thrust was used til 60 kts. We exited the runway at the end and held in a holding area prior to the taxiway. We then asked emergency personnel to look at our left engine for any sign of damage or fire. They informed us all clear. We waited for ZZZ Maintenance to arrive with the tug and inspect our brakes, tires and engine prior to being towed to a hard stand. The FO did a fantastic job flying and communicating with ATC, the landing was smooth and no issues with brake temp or tires. The Relief Pilot was an unbelievable asset during this time, communicating and running checklists as well as monitoring the CA (Captain) and FO. Excellent job!		After takeoff and gear retraction, left EPR blanked out followed by EEC L EICAS message. The Cabin Crew called the flight deck and stated sparks were seen out of the left engine. We [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZZ airport. The FO (First Officer) was flying and talking to ATC. The Captain and Relief Pilot ran the EECL. [The Relief Pilot also contacted Operations to notify Dispatch. We proceeded to Runway XX while conducting the Non-routine Landing and Overweight Landing checklists. The secondary engine instruments showed no abnormal indications. The FO landed the aircraft at 604,700 lbs. on longest runway with both engines operating. Max reverse was used until 60 kts., then minimum braking was applied. Aircraft exited at the end of Runway XX. [Airport response] equipment looked over left engine for signs of damage or fire. None was seen. Maintenance then inspected the gear, tires, brakes and engine before being towed to a hard stand for parking. Entire crew performed their duties professionally and diligently.Cause: Turbine bypass malfunction.		Air Carrier flight crew reported multiple left engine malfunctions during takeoff. Flight crew performed an air turn back to departure airport where a safe landing was completed and maintenance was provided.

I was pilot flying (PF). As we were approaching our cruise altitude of FL 370 a caution light illuminated which had the Captain and I staring up at the ENG 2 LOW PRESSURE light. The Captain ran the QRH which just directed HYD PUMP switch (affected side) OFF. The B System Pressure remained in the normal range and the hydraulic quantity held at 106%, so we decided to continue to the original destination. Dispatch was notified through ACARS of the situation. 90 minutes later, story time was interrupted by the illumination of ELEC 1 LOW PRESSURE light and I noticed the Hydraulic B quantity dropped rapidly to 0%. The Captain then ran the LOSS OF SYSTEM B QRH. A discussion was had regarding if the situation required a diversion to a longer runway. After being notified, Dispatch ran Stopping Performance numbers, which still resulted in positive numbers, and a now required 30 minutes of brake cool down off the gate. A request for priority handling was made at this point. Twenty minutes after loss of System B, the ENG 1 LOW PRESSURE light illuminated (now the A side is acting up). QRH directed the affected switch be turned off. Realizing that communication via ACARS was hindering our ability to share a mental model with Dispatch and the collection of required data, in a timely manner, I requested a nearby Ops Station to patch our flight through to Dispatch. The Captain conversed with ZZZ while I handled COMM 1. The remaining ELEC 2 pump was providing adequate reduced flow pressure and the A Hydraulic System retained its quantity.Dispatch ran Runway performance numbers for Loss of System A and B, just in case, which still yielded positive stopping performance. After considering the advantages of using the HUD for the approach, the Captain and I switched flying roles (I was now pilot monitoring). We ran the deferred items for the LOSS OF SYSTEM B and received vectors for a long final approach for a flaps 15 landing. A good landing was made, and after the Captain exited the runway, we taxied to a spot to wait out our brake cool down, all the while being monitored by the local Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) who were surrounding the aircraft. While allowing the brakes to cool, several of our Company aircraft reported that fluid was leaking from the underside of Engine 2 (The ARFF Crew was concerned that it may be fuel.). The Captain then directed me to shut Engine 2 off. In the non-normal state that we then found ourselves, we elected to get towed into the gate.				First Officer reported the loss of both B Hydraulic System Pumps led to the loss of the B Hydraulic System. The flight crew continued to destination airport and made a safe landing.

As we taxied past, we noticed there was a large amount of fluid pooled on the taxiway underneath the right engine. We would come to learn that this aircraft had a loss of Hydraulic System B. The next morning, we reported for our flight at ZZZ1. When we began our preflight duties, Maintenance Personnel came and retrieved the logbook stating there were write ups that needed to be reviewed. We continued boarding the aircraft, got to our scheduled departure time and the logbook had not yet been returned. While we were discussing this, the Captain noticed and brought to my attention that the 'Flap Inhibit' switch was toggled active. We had figured at that point that this aircraft was likely the same aircraft we saw the day prior. Approximately 10 minutes after our scheduled departure time, the logbook was returned, reviewed, and the appropriate checklists completed. We discussed with the Maintenance Personnel that the # 2 engine driven hydraulic pump had been replaced overnight and a ground run had been performed. We departed the gate shortly after this. There were no anomalies on the engine start, taxi, or warmup period. After the takeoff sequence, as the pilot flying (PF), I called for the landing gear to be selected up. While the landing gear retracted, there was a momentary Master Caution light and I saw HYD illuminated on the recall panel. It lasted for less than one second. The hydraulic indications were all normal. During the climbout, we discussed that during the ground run, the landing gear would not have been cycled and that this may have caused the momentary Master Caution/HYD light.We continued the climb and approximately 15-20 minutes into the flight (abeam ZZZ2), the Master Caution light illuminated again with a Low Pressure light illuminated on the ENG 2 HYD Pump. We ran the QRH procedure, which had us place that pump in the OFF position. The quantities and pressures were both still normal at that point. We discussed our options and contacted Dispatch. We felt that continuing to destination was the best course of action. We spent the next 30 minutes or so discussing different scenarios about system failures, reviewing the QRH procedures, etc. I would like to point out that the Captain was very knowledgeable with the systems and it was a great learning experience as I have about 270 hours in type. During this discussion, we noticed that the Hydraulic System A was now indicating 78%. When we departed it was >90%. I wrote down the quantity and time on the ATIS sheet so that we could track the fluid level. Over the next 20 minutes or so, we determined that we had a slow leak of about 2% every eight to nine minutes. I calculated that we would land in ZZZ3 with about 55 to 60% fluid quantity in System A. While we were discussing the now escalating situation, the Hydraulic System B fluid quantity went from 106% to 0% in about 30 seconds. We now had a complete loss of System B with what we believed to be a slow leak in System A. We immediately decided to [request priority handling], notified Center and requested immediate descent and vectors to ZZZ. We ran the loss of System B QRH procedure, walked through an Approach Brief discussing the nuances of our failed systems and how we would configure. I flew the aircraft and talked to ATC while the Captain coordinated with Dispatch, the Cabin Crew, and ran the QRH. The approach and landing were uneventful.		Divert due to hydraulic system failure. Probationary First Officer (FO) did a great job.		B737-800 flight crew reported the failure of the #2 EDP in flight with the subsequent loss of both main hydraulic systems resulting in a diversion.

On a second call from the crew, we were told it was an electronic device in a bag on fire with smoke. We leveled off, [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Departure Control, and told them we would be returning to the airport and requested vectors. A deadheading Company pilot in the back called the cockpit and told us there was a lot of smoke and possible burns to a passenger. I told him we were returning to ZZZ. While on vectors, we contacted Dispatch and told them the situation and that we would be returning. We contacted the flight attendants and told them to secure the cabin, that we were 10 minutes from landing. They told us the fire was out and smoke was dissipating. We ran checklists and landing performance data for Runway XYR. We landed 1300 lb. over max landing weight. Fire and Rescue was waiting for us on the ground and at the gate. Medics checked over the passenger who owned the laptop that was on fire and reported no injuries. No crew was injured or passengers.		Shortly after liftoff from Runway XX at ZZZ we had a call from the flight attendants stating that there was a fire in the cabin. We queried about the type and were told that there was an iPad or computer that was causing a fire and smoke in the cabin. We climbed through 1000 ft. and cleaned up the aircraft, [requested priority handling] with ATC, and asked for vectors to return to the airport. The Captain was flying and flew the vectors. We coordinated with ATC and kept abreast of the situation in the back of the aircraft. There was a Company Captain in the back traveling to ZZZ1 who called the flight deck and stated the situation appeared to be under control and there had been a significant amount of smoke in the cabin during the event. We landed on Runway XYR in visual conditions and were met by the firetrucks and taxied to the gate and deplaned with no further incidents.		B737-700 flight crew reported being notified by the flight attendants of an electronic device igniting in the cabin during initial climb. Flight crew returned to the departure airport where it was determined no injuries were found on the crew or passengers.

We had fault lights illuminated on the GEN ENG 1 and PTU (Power Transfer Unit) switch. We ran the ECAM which directed us to switch both the GRN ENG 1 and PTU off. The status page listed all the inoperative systems. It also stated that we should attempt to restore GRN ENG 1 to extend the gear and if unable a gravity extension would be required. We then referenced the FM non-normals for review, reviewed the gravity extension and computed the landing distance required. The Captain [advised] Center and requested direct ZZZ. We had XXX [passengers and crew] and around 1:45 minutes of [fuel]. Next the Captain made contact with my Dispatcher through ARINC. He explained the situation and his intentions to land at ZZZ1. We set the aircraft up for a 20 nm final, turned the GRN ENG 1 pump back on and selected gear down. The gear extension was slower than normal but we did receive a 3 GREEN and locked indication. The GRN ENG 1 was switched back off. We touched down in the first 1000 ft. of XXL and came to a stop with 1500 ft. remaining. We ran an after landing flow, then referenced the FM Supplementary section for Tow-in procedures. After shutting down the engines the Fire department informed us we were leaking hydraulic fluid out of the nose wheel area. End of incident, the Captain notified all required authorities.

At 5000 ft. the aircraft started to roll slowly to the left as we encountered the wake from the 787. The autopilot kicked off and the FO (First Officer) being the Flying Pilot grabbed the controls. He was startled a bit and neutralized the controls while starting to do the [upset] callouts. This delay caused us to roll to 45-50 degrees of bank and lost about 300 ft. We advised New York Approach Control and they gave us a heading and altitude. I checked in with the cabin crew and everyone was ok. The flight continued with no further issues.		We were vectored off the PHLBO3 arrival, descended to 5000 ft. on a northerly heading [when] without warning we experienced wake turbulence that rolled the aircraft to the left 50-60 degrees. I reacted by quickly interpreting the instruments, saying 'push, roll, thrust, stabilize' and correcting [with] a momentary push followed by rolling back to the right. As we stabilized the aircraft, the Captain contacted ATC and informed them of the wake turbulence event. We descended about 300-400 ft. and were left of assigned heading by approximately 30 degrees. We were given a new heading and told that we were following a [B787] Dreamliner. We had not been informed or cautioned about the preceding aircraft type and we never had reason to believe spacing was a concern. I re-engaged the autopilot and were vectored for a visual approach to 22L and landed without further incident.		B737NG flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence on descent into EWR in trail of a B787 that resulted in a 45-50 degree bank.

I was given command of the aircraft and radios while the Captain communicated with dispatch via the Application. We were instructed to have FA's seek medical assistance. After a short period we were advised by the Flight Attendants that 3 of 5 oxygen bottles failed to operate and that the passenger would not have enough oxygen to make it the remainder of the flight. During this time the passenger was being attended by a physician on board. The passengers situation was improving but then quickly deteriorated. At this time, the physician on board communicates that we need to divert, and quickly. The Captain informed Operations Control and Dispatch and the mutual decision to divert is made. ZZZ is agreed upon and I was instructed by the Captain to [request priority handling] and divert to ZZZ. We maintained maximum safe forward speed and got on the ground as safely and practically as possible. Due to our load, we anticipated an overweight landing. While I managed the flying, the radios and coordinated with ground personnel, the Captain accomplished the applicable checklists. Upon completion of the checklists and briefing the controls were transferred to the Captain and he made the landing and then taxied to the gate. The passenger was removed via paramedics, and we communicated with dispatch and maintenance.Although its not known if the passenger would have made it to ZZZ1 with all O2 bottle operational, it limited time and diversion options. Unfortunately a medical diversion is unpredictable.

Maintenance ultimately performed a dual engine isolation test and cleared the aircraft for return to service.  No odor issues were detected until we were on descent into ZZZ. At approximately 13,500 feet, the cockpit filled with the dirty sock smell and slowly dissipated. Then again at approximately 2,000 feet while on the RNAV XXL into ZZZ the cockpit again filled with another blast of foul air (same smell) and slowly dissipated. This aircraft had been written up for an odor event on date 1 (I believe) and the APU placed on MEL and had now encountered two back-to-back events. I wrote up the aircraft upon arrival in ZZZ and ZZZ Maintenance Control was notified.				A320 Captain reported a recurring 'dirty socks' odor during descent.

Immediate, abrupt, right hard over exceeding autopilot parameters and it disconnected. Hand flew  aircraft to 12,000 checking trim, overhead, assessing for any obvious issues. Nothing unusual was noted. I ensured aircraft was in trim, while flying wings level in a climb, and selected autopilot A again. Repeat of previous abrupt/violent hard over to the right, exceeding autopilot parameters, with resulting autopilot disconnect. Ran the checklist for uncommanded autopilot disconnect. Elected to return to the airport as it was an extreme autopilot disconnect. Ran non-routine landing checklist. Burned down fuel to max landing as the aircraft was flying as expected and without issue by hand. Landing uneventful. Cause - Startle effect is real. I missed the 'my aircraft' call getting the aircraft under control the first time. (I'm not sure if flight recorders are checked, but there was likely some expletives in place of the 'my aircraft' call, I apologize.) My First Officer (FO) did say 'your aircraft.' When we ran the checklist for uncommanded autopilot disconnect, it did not say to select the other autopilot, although we discussed it, and decided the airplane was flying fine manually, and the disconnect on A was extreme enough that we didn't want to experience issues with B. That said, the first thing maintenance asked, was if we tried B. Suggest revising the checklist if they want the crews to try the other autopilot regardless of a hard over.Suggestions - Mechanical failures happen no matter how good a maintenance program.

The shimmy progressively got worse and a few seconds prior to rotation we heard a single knock. We lifted off normally and retracted the landing gear. The retraction was slightly louder and the spin down of the nose wheel was longer than normal. Eventually the noise ceased when the wheel rotation stopped. The climb and cruise was normal. About halfway through our flight to ZZZ1, we were told by ZZZ Center that the Tower in ZZZ reported they found tire debris on the runway after our departure. We discussed the situation with each other and based on the events from take-off we felt we probably had damage to the tire. We discussed our options and reviewed our manual, which had guidance for failed tire on take-off and landing with a flat tire. We both agreed our safest option was to divert to ZZZ2.It provided us with a longer runway option as well as maintenance and operations availability. We notified ATC and [requested priority handling] with a diversion to ZZZ2. We then notified Dispatch, the Flight Attendants, and passengers. We reviewed the landing procedures in the manual and briefed the landing. The landing was normal and we were able to maintain directional control. We stopped on the runway and vehicles approached to inspect the damage. They said the left nose wheel was missing the outer tread but was still inflated. The right nose wheel had no damage. We agreed we could taxi to the gate safely. Maintenance met us at the gate and the aircraft was taken out of service. We were given a new aircraft and we completed the flight to ZZZ1 2 hours delayed. No injuries occurred on the flight.		When we landed in ZZZ we noticed a significant shimmy in the nose wheel. We asked Maintenance to meet the aircraft at the gate. When they arrived to the flight deck, the Mechanic told us that there was nothing wrong with the gear, but that it was low on grease. The Mechanic told us that he was adding more grease to the assembly, and that that should fix the shimmy. I asked if I should put a write-up in the logbook, and the Mechanic told me that I didn't need to, since nothing was broken on the nose wheel assembly. I followed this guidance, but I now feel that this was the incorrect course of action. In the future, I will put every mechanical discrepancy in the logbook, no matter how minor it seems, or what guidance I receive from the Mechanic.

No smoke associated. Initiated abort. Escorted back to Gate XX with CFR (Crash Fire Rescue).We were unable to identify source of smell.		After engine start and during taxi for departure, FO (First Officer) and I noticed a cheesy, dirty sock smell. We discussed while FO looked up possible causes in the AOM. I called the FAs (Flight Attendants) to determine if the smell was permeating the cabin. We also turned off the recirc fans for approximately 2 minutes. FA 1 did a walk through the cabin and didn't notice the smell until she returned to the first class cabin and forward gallery area. We turned the recirc fans back on and the smell seemed to flush out and dissipate. We decided to continue our taxi for takeoff. When cleared for takeoff, FO set power and we initiated our takeoff roll. At approximately 80 kts., FO verbalized 'do you smell that?'. I did, and over the next second or 2 considered the go/no go decision. I elected to reject the takeoff at approximately 90-100 kts. due to the strong odor and smells we experienced. FO requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) as we taxied clear of the runway. Odor greatly dissipated after the rejected takeoff and the reduced power settings.Passengers were talked to and FA's were called to assess the cabin situation. ARFF did a 'lap' around the aircraft and scanned for hot spots to include the brakes. They gave us the all clear and since the odor/smells had greatly dissipated, we elected an escorted taxi to the gate. During taxi back, the cheesy smell returned, but in a much reduced and slight degree. Upon gate arrival, all passengers deplaned. I suspect I may have been a little bit nose blind after being exposed to the smells for the short period of time. This may have affected my decision making from the standpoint of not smelling the odors as sharply and distinctly enough until the higher power settings were established during the takeoff roll. At which point the smells became more distinct and seemed to be getting stronger.I also believed that the odors/smells were of a transient nature and would dissipate.We could have returned to the gate during taxi after noticing the cheesy smell and determining it may have been oil fumes. We discussed this possibility and when the odor dissipated, we felt that whatever was the cause, may have 'burned off' and was therefore no longer an issue or threat.		B737-800 flight crew reported a 'dirty socks' odor during takeoff roll. The flight crew rejected the takeoff and requested special handling to return to the departure gate where the passengers deplaned and maintenance was provided.

Weather was approximately 1500 ft. ceiling with strong tailwind at altitude during beginning of the approach, which switched to a headwind at approximately 2500 ft. Initially ATC told to expect XY, then toward the end of the STAR switched to XXR. ATC kept us at/or above 10000 ft. a little longer than expected and 210 kts., faster than desired. After being cleared for the approach with a high crossing restriction of 10000 ft., we had to attempt to configure early and attempt to capture the glide slope from above. The tailwind kept us high and fast. It became obvious we would not be stable and began talking about a go-around. Around that time, the autopilot began to capture the glide slope from above and the aircraft began to aggressively dive. We received a momentary GPWS 'sink rate' warning. We immediately executed a go around. Due to the weather factors and startle effect, climbing away from the terrain became the top priority and airspeed quickly increased before the flaps could be retracted before they were oversped by about 5-10 kts. We stabilized the aircraft and successfully performed another ILS approach to XXR and landed. Initially the First Officer (F/O) was PF for the approach, but during the start of the go-around the Captain (CA) stated 'my aircraft' and took control of the plane until the aircraft was stabilized after the go-around. The aircraft was then turned back over to the F/O for the subsequent approach and landing. Ceilings at 1500 ft. High altitude airport. Inexperience with this airport. F/O with 50 hours. CA did not point out recommended techniques quickly enough on approach. Excessive tailwind during initial phase of approach. ATC high crossing restriction and required speed of 210 kts. until attempting to capture glideslope. Inadequate go-around procedures by F/O required CA to take control of the aircraft. GPWS alert startle factor caused F/O to delay PM duties during go-around. ATC at high altitude airports should not impose excessive height or speed restrictions. Company recommended configuration, altitudes, and speeds at high altitude airport.				A320 flight crew reported an unstabilized approach, go-around procedure, and a subsequent flap overspeed.

Accomplished the ECAM, verified that the Yellow reservoir was indicating low level on the system page, and reviewed the Status page. Reviewed landing distance and choice of runway. Went through options with the FO (First Officer) and we agreed to continue on to ZZZ after contacting Dispatch. [Requested priority handling] with Center and proceeded to a point on final for Runway XXC. FO completed the uneventful landing, FO was very experienced and I was comfortable with him landing aircraft. [Priority] personnel checked the aircraft on taxiway and then we proceeded to the gate with trucks following. While at cruise, I decided to bring the Purser up to brief her on the situation and brief the situation. We did not prep the cabin, but just had them review steps for evacuation so they were fresh in memory. I had plenty of time to bring her to the cockpit for the brief. I had an immediate situation with a young crew before and they came off the plane shaking, so if there is time I now try to look them in eye and let them see I am calm. I think this worked well with our situation.		Cruise at FL360 got ECAM Yellow Hydraulic System Low Reservoir Level. Followed the ECAM procedures and calculated landing distance.

She also informed us that another Flight Attendant was smelling and feeling the same thing. The Captain asked if they could swap places with the aft Flight Attendants to confirm what was happening. They did and confirmed what FA said. After a brief discussion it was best to divert back to ZZZ due to having better medical care, longer runways for an overweight landing, and better services for the passengers. We began the process of coordinating with ATC for a clearance and [requested priority handling] due to having incapacitated crew members. The QRC and QRH procedures were completed and we also descended to 10,000 ft. in case we would need to turn off both packs. Not long after we began the return, we were informed that the FA was being administered oxygen. Only the right pack was turned off. After a few minutes, the FA reported feeling better, but then later the symptoms returned and oxygen was administered again. We prepared for our arrival in to ZZZ. Things were uneventful other that a little more communication regarding the [event] and Operations.Once at the gate, emergency personnel boarded the aircraft and assessed the FA. They took her in to the terminal and then we began deplaning the passengers. Maintenance logs were filled out. Phone calls were made to the union, the Duty Officer, crew scheduling, and others. We decided to all be checked medically. All the Flight Attendants were transported by ambulance. The Captain drove me to the hospital where I was checked. Afterwards, I talked with scheduling about a hotel and what would happen next. I went to the hotel and got to my room around XA:00am.I did not recognize the event as one that required the use of a QRC or QRH procedure. It was only after we began to divert back to ZZZ that the Captain began to do the QRC. This delay possibly led to increased exposure to the fumes, but reduced the total time of the incident.In an incident like this, I think it would be most appropriate to isolate the crew from passengers. This would allow assessment to be completed more timely, and reduce the possibility of social media exposure. It would also allow crew members to make all the phone calls necessary to report the incident. The number of phone calls required to be made by the Captain was enormous. Having one incident response phone call would considerably reduce the stress of the situation and allow a more timely medical assessment of crew members. There was only one person performing assessments, and when the passengers saw that crew members were being assessed and wheeled out on gurneys, they became more agitated about what they could have been exposed to and requested assessment. I did my best to alleviate the work load of the Captain, but there was only so much I could do.Also, it can be daunting for a person to be in an unfamiliar city while experiencing a situation like this. It would be best to keep crew members together as best as possible, at least in the same hospital.One of the biggest recommendations I can make is to get rid of an outside contractor in coordinating medical care in emergency cases. The process was difficult, unnecessary, and extremely frustrating. I had people calling me during required rest times. I found out after I got home that they had not considered me cleared to travel until the case was closed (after I had deadheaded to ZZZ1, stayed the night, deadheaded to ZZZ2, and commuted home). Outside contractors are not familiar with our operation and did not work in my best interest.		We received a call from forward Flight Attendants alerting us to a 'smelly socks' odor in the forward portion of the passenger cabin and saying that both were light headed. I asked that the aft Flight Attendants give a report on their condition as well as other passengers in the forward cabin. Aft attendants confirmed the smell forward but were unaffected while aft. Passengers forward also noted the smell and lightheadedness. Neither Captain nor FO (First Officer) noted any fumes or symptoms. We shortly received word that the 'A' Flight Attendant had to sit and go on oxygen. At this point, I determined that due to crew incapacitation we would need to return to a suitable field without any undue delay. We received clearance to proceed direct ZZZ from ATC. We [were given priority handling] and squawked XXXX. I chose ZZZ for the longer runway because we were 8000 lbs. above MLW and the more robust medical facilities there. We received clearance to descend to 10,000 ft. I did this to burn fuel off but primarily to ensure that if the fumes condition worsened we could depressurize the aircraft immediately. radar contact with Center. Right pack off per QRH smoke and fumes procedure. FAs (Flight Attendants) reported smell had abated and air was fresher. Landed ZZZI was distracted with safely diverting the aircraft in [the] airspace. It took about 20 minutes after the initial report and ten minutes after [we advised ATC] to start on the QRH procedure. The Aviate, Navigate, Communicate, Checklist guideline kept us from getting the right pack off in a timely manner. Immediate and timely execution of the smoke and fumes QRH procedure may have lessened to exposure to fumes experienced by those in the passenger cabin.Determining the severity of the situation was difficult. Ultimately, we made the decision to trust the concerns of our cabin crew despite not having any corroborating evidence. At the time of this writing, I still don't know whether Maintenance has determined a source of the fumes. The deciding factor was hearing that the 'A' had gone on O2 and had to sit. At that point, a crew member was incapacitated and we [had advised ATC].The decision to turn and descend in ETOPS airspace had to be weighed against the advantage of an immediate return and descent vs. positive deconfliction with other ETOPS aircraft. We opted to wait for clearance because we felt the situation in the cabin didn't warrant immediate turn and descent without ATC clearance.Advocate for the crew once blocked in. It was difficult to keep up with the myriad of calls, reports etc. after we reached the gate while simultaneously ensuring the crew were properly cared for. Medical support was great but it would be nice to have one crew member make all the arrangements for everyone so we could concentrate on other tasks. Setting up my medical care distracted me from necessary interaction with first responders, Maintenance, Dispatch, Operations etc.		Air Carrier Flight Crew reported being notified by a Flight Attendant of a 'smelly odor' in the cabin. The Flight Crew requested priority handling to a suitable alternate where a safe landing was executed and medical evaluation was provided to crew members.

Not long after reaching FL310 ATC reported 747 traffic to cross flight path at FL320. It was dark at the time and crew never saw crossing aircraft but a few moments later flight encountered wake turbulence that caused the autopilot to disengage and the aircraft to shudder and roll. The PF (Pilot Flying) FO (First Officer) was able to maintain control through the event with considerable effort. The aircraft did lose 200 ft. When clear of wake turbulence the aircraft was returned to FL310 and encounter was reported to ATC. Cabin crew was contacted to ensure everyone was 'OK' and PM (Pilot Monitoring) made a PA to passengers. Cabin crew was also debriefed after flight.  ATC could possibly avoid descending an aircraft below a crossing heavy aircraft to prevent a wake turbulence event.

Condition were IFR with light to moderate Rain and visibility of 2/1/2 mile at the surface. Pilot flying (PF) was First Officer (FO), and I was the pilot monitoring (PM). We were given a descent clearance to be followed by a base turn to final. While descending on the downwind, FO stated that the aircraft was making an uncommanded turn. With his hands on the control the Autopilot disengaged. FO struggle to regain control indicating strong control force and a pitch down trim force. Concern was a possible runaway trim. I immediately deployed the trim wheel handle and began to trim airplane aft according to FO instruction. My only concern at the time was flying the airplane and regaining control. The only indication I remember up to this point was the red Autopilot annunciator illuminated. ATC called several time to issue turn instruction. We did not respond, due to the urgency of aircraft control. After regaining control, there were concerns about the trim as express by the FO. I decided to eliminate confusion and cutoff the stab trim switches. I informed the FO that switches were cutoff and that we were now manual trim. I then responded to ATC and [requested priority handling]. ATC acknowledged the request and requested the standard passenger count and fuel onboard. I want to land ASAP, now that we had control under what seemed to be manual reversion. The FO was doing a great job turn and descending. We were able to turn and descent to 4,000 ft. and establish ourselves on final. There was much dialog and sense of urgency in our communication in the flight deck. I wanted to land immediately, since time was a factor and weather was not in our favor. As we started to configure with flaps, we attempted to extend the gear. The gear did not extend. At this point it became an approach to landing would not be feasible. I requested a straight out miss and maintaining 4,000 ft. ATC granted that request and shortly thereafter gave us a climb to 8,000 ft. and a turn to the east. At this point, we got busy in a hurry. FO wanted to clean up the flaps. This made sense as first and then I reconsidered. Valuable time was being wasted trying to climb and configure, I also did not see any advantage to clean up with a hydraulic issue. I did not want to lose the use of flaps and then complicate issue more. This was discussed between the FO and I. We agreed not to clean up completely. We left the flaps a 1, the indicator stop a 5. I instructed ATC that we were going to stop the climb at 5,000 ft. They gave us clearance to maintain 5,000 ft. This helped us focus on the gear problem. At this point, I also decided to bring the jump seat pilot into helping us. I instructed him to plug in a headset. Up to this point, everything was just happening too fast and I needed to slow things down and get the gear down. I opened the QRH and started the Manual gear extension checklist. I had the Jump Seat Pilot extend the gear since he had great access to these handles. Right gear was dropped first, this caused a yaw to the right and a pitch down attitude. More manual trim required. Then nose and left gear. This stabilized the yaw. At this point, I was ready to come back for the approach and advised ATC. They started to give us headings back to ILS XXC. I ask the FO is he was OK, or needed a break. He informed me that he was good to continue pilot flying. I then instructed the Jump Seater to monitor FO and keep him focus and talk to him and the same time, I instructed FO to keep the turns to no more than 10 degrees. I advised ATC, that we need a shallow intercept to final. I notice that HYD B system was at 60 percent and brake pressure just above 2,500 PSI. I coordinated with the FO and we agreed that he would only fly the plane. I had the Thrust Levers and the trim. We settled on a speed of 170 kts. for approach. Again, Flap handle was at 1 while indicator was at 5. We broke out at 400 ft. AGL with runway in sight and light showers. Once landing was assured, I set the power to idle. FO needed back trim to arrest the sink rate. I trim back aggressively. We landed and max brake was applied. Control was exchanged and I was able to turn off slowly clearing the runway. We were towed to our gate.Time, Weather and operating in a terminal area under IFR condition with no Autopilot.				B737-800 Captain reported loss of autopilot and hydraulic system failure caused controllability issues in flight. The flight crew performed a go around, regained aircraft control and landed at destination airport.

We received a vector off the approach with a decent down to 4,000 feet. As we were making our descent into the airfield a loud bang was heard over by the First Officers right side. It was very loud and jarring to both pilots. Shortly after hearing the sound the First Officers instruments went to a very erratic state. The airspeed and altitude made multiple erratic movement with activation of the stick shaker during the approach on final. The Captains instruments remained accurate and matched the standby instrument in the center console. We would later find major damage to the pitot tube for the First Officer accompanied with physical damage to the skin. The Captain started the checklist followed by [requesting priority handling]. The Captain also made a call to the back to keep the flight attendants informed of the status of passengers as many had heard multiple impacts on the wing and engine nacelle. The aircraft was controllable so the Captain decided we should continue the approach and land. We were able to land the aircraft without any further incident and had airport response follow the aircraft to the Gate. Normally the highest bird activity is during sunrise and sunset. Also birds normally are found at much lower altitudes. As we were making the arrival to the airport it may be better to slow the aircraft further. However at the time of the incident it was very dark so I highly doubt the impact could be avoided. A slower speed may have lessened the damage. A BASH (Bird/Wildlife Air Strike Hazard) program may also be effective around the airport if they don't already have one.				First Officer reported a bird strike during approach. The flight crew continued to landing. After landing, major damage was discovered to the First Officer's pitot probe and surrounding fuselage skin and structure.

With this minimal clearance, Tower cleared another Company aircraft to take off on Runway XY for a cross runway departure. I'm used to this as I deal with it in ZZZ all the time. You can see the aircraft rolling and judge relatively quickly that your paths will not cross, that there is no real collision threat. In this case, it (no kidding) looked like we could be on a collision course, with both of us meeting at the runway intersection point. There was a pretty good crosswind and it's a performance critical runway on the best of days, so I had a lot to do.On top of all of that, I was worried that there may be an ATC mistake and was constantly thinking about what I was going to do if I went around. If he lifted off early, would there be a mid-air potential? If I continued and he didn't lift off, would there be a ground collision potential? Tower was busy telling the preceding aircraft to clear the runway, so the radio frequency wasn't clear. My First Officer (FO) and I were on the same page so he started giving me continuous updates on the departing aircraft, when it was rolling and how we looked. He ultimately said he thought we'd be okay, but it wasn't until 100 ft. that I saw the departing aircraft fill the windscreen as it rotated right in front of me. Honestly, this stuff scares the crap out of me. I've been flying here for 26 years and have seen a lot, I've got combat time as a Carrier Fighter Pilot, but this honestly scared me.				B737-800 Captain reported a Critical Ground Conflict event during a cross runway departure. Flight crew stated spacing was dangerously inadequate spacing for a cross runway departure.

He also smelled it. We then noticed that it smelled like dirty socks. The Captain directed me to send a message to Dispatch so they could plan for Maintenance due to a fume event while he checked with the Flight Attendants. The A Flight Attendant also smelled the odor. We continued the descent and the smell grew stronger. I stated that my head was hurting and I felt nauseated. The Captain also was noticing weird symptoms so he called for us to don the oxygen masks and run the procedure for smoke/fire/fumes. While I was accomplishing the checklist, the Captain flew the airplane and handled radio communications and [requested priority handling to destination]. We flew the RNAV approach due to a NOTAM for the ILS and IMC. Upon landing, we taxied to the gate and shutdown the engines and opened the windows before removing the oxygen masks. We got the passengers off quickly. The A Flight Attendant admitted that she threw up and had a sore throat. I also felt unwell. While walking to the hotel van, all 3 Flight Attendants said they felt odd and dizzy with headaches. I also had the same symptoms. We all discussed going to the ER but the Pilots and Flight Attendants were scheduled for 2 different hotels. I exchanged numbers with them and told them to call if they continued to worsen or needed medical care. After getting to the hotel, I continued to feel dizzy, have a headache, and felt like my coordination and concentration was taking more energy than usual. I went to the nearest ER within 1 hour of the event. The Flight Attendant text me and said she vomited 2 times and felt very sick but that she and the other flight attendants were not going to the ER because they 'can't afford the sick points, and our union said we'd get penalized and have to fight to remove the points.' I received blood work, fluids, and O2 for 4.5 hours at the ER. I removed myself from the trip and still felt unwell for 48 hours. The A Flight Attendant worked the next day but sought medical attention after her trip ended due to lingering effects.Find and fix the issues causing fume events and don't allow employees to be penalized or fear reprisal for seeking medical assistance/ being pressured to fly unwell.				A320 First Officer reported a dirty socks odor during descend. The Flight crew requested priority handling to destination where a safe landing was completed. Crew experienced physiological symptoms.

Cockpit / Cabin Odor Recognition and Isolation, was referenced and flight deck oxygen masks were deployed. Inflight was called and advised to utilize oxygen as well if necessary. The odor was reported as increasing and intensifying in the cabin. Per the guidelines, the intensity was determined to be [low] initially but increased. A message was sent to Operations advising of the situation and requesting diversion options. Operations indicated ZZZ as the preferred divert destination and we concurred. ATC was notified and we received clearance to ZZZ. Dispatch sent planning information. A passenger PA was made explaining the cabin air issue and that we would be returning to land at ZZZ. ATC provided expedited handling of our arrival and thus no emergency was declared. Inflight was advised of information. An approach, landing and gate arrival were completed without incident.

The flight crew identified the malfunction and continued to fly the aircraft to Runway XX. During those final moments before touchdown, the Pilot Flying was able to slowly reduce thrust on #2 engine, thereby minimizing the continuation of the compressor stall. The landing was uneventful. Upon clearing the runway, the assigned gate was not available, at which time the crew parked in hold bay X. Prior to shutting down the #2 engine in the hold bay, the flight crew noted a 100 degree C. difference between the #2 engine and the #1 engine, with the #2 engine being higher.

Then Captain requested priority handling and explained ATC what was going on in order to get to lower altitude and we were cleared direct to ZZZ. Around 5 minutes later ECAM messages disappeared and engine parameters were checked. We decided to use engine 2 back as Eng 2 parameter were continuously checked. ATC was notified that we had that engine back. COM 2 was checked for more actions to do. I took aircraft control and we briefed for plan of action in case we had more problem with Eng 2.

I wasn't told about the odor until below 10,000 ft. but I was later told it started at top of descent. The odor was persistent in nature during the entire descent. Then, it disappeared upon landing and shutdown. At the gate, Maintenance ran the APU bleed with the packs on at the gate with the engines shut down. Nobody on the plane noticed the dirty sock odor anymore. Because the airplane had no prior history and the odor had disappeared, Maintenance returned the aircraft to service with the APU still operable.

I was told that passengers were very much complaining and trying to move to the forward half of the plane during the climb-out, approximately 4,000 ft. The inflight crew had to relocate as well.We immediately ran all necessary procedures. I asked my FO (First Officer) to continue flying and to take the radios so that I could begin troubleshooting. The odor isolation procedure proved to be unsuccessful. After each step, I checked back with the inflight crew to see if conditions improved. They did not. The QRH procedures were also unsuccessful, up to the point where we were forced to turn BOTH packs off. At this point, it was obvious that we would not be able to climb above 10,000 ft. due to our unpressurized state. Continuing to ZZZZ was no longer viable. At this point, I assumed the radios and asked ATC for a return to ZZZ.Inflight crewmembers stated that the fumes had subsided at this point, but they were experiencing symptoms such as dizziness, burning eyes, chest pain, and labored breathing. Each inflight crewmember seemed to have different symptoms. I asked if they wanted medical attention, to which they declined. As we got closer to ZZZ, I told the First Officer that I would rather request help and not need it rather than the other way around. While the First Officer was managing the aircraft and radios, I notified Dispatch, ran the divert QRH, the Over-Weight Landing QRH, helped reprogram the FMS, etc. A normal approach and soft landing was made.

Received an ANTI ICE LEAK ENG R EICAS Message displayed climbing through approximately 10,500 ft. Annunciated checklist was completed resulting in the right engine being reduced to idle thrust. [Priority handling was requested] and a return to ZZZZ was requested with ATC. The NON-NORMAL LANDING checklist was run followed by the OVERWEIGHT LANDING checklist. The landing app was used to derive landing distance, runway XX provided more than sufficient distance on the runway at our weight. All normal checklists were completed.Operation was conducted in VFR conditions. ILS XX was set up in the navigation and briefed to provide glide path and a more stable approach and touchdown.Approach, transition were normal, rate of descent at touchdown was minimal, very soft and we rolled the aircraft the full length of the runway. We requested ATC to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) meet us at the end of Runway XX to inspect the brakes, ATC requested that we turn off the runway onto taxiway hotel. No ARFF came. We asked again and were provided a standard taxi instruction. We explained out need and asked again for ARFF. We were requested to taxi up X to Y taxiway before ARFF would check our aircraft. With brakes still in white we attempted the taxi without using brakes. Turning onto Taxiway Y BRAKE TEMP EICAS message displayed. ARFF then came out to evaluate. At that point brakes brakes 7,8,10 and 11 had just come into cautionary range. Approximately 25 minutes after landing. We stopped the aircraft on Y without using the parking brake. ARFF checked the brakes and said brakes and tires looked good and we could continue our taxi to the gate. Taxi Brake Cooling Chart at our weight showed 30 more minutes of cooling was needed to be considered safe. Shortly after, the number 7 Tire lost pressure. Thankfully ARFF had stayed with us as we sat through the cooling window. We found a huge disconnect communicating with the Tower and the relay of information from the ARFF team. For 98% of the operational needs of the airport, ZZZZ Tower does a great job. When situations like this take place, the ability to relay nuanced information between the fire trucks and the cockpit was a struggle. There were a few very key moments that were left with dead air or need to ask for clarification of the status of the situation. As we approached our brake cooling time, the temperature of the brakes was back in the normal range. Our mechanics showed up on Taxiway Y with a tug and headset. After they assessed the aircraft to be safe, ARFF accompanied us to the gate without further incident.In reviewing aircraft log and history of right engine fire loop 1 issues before departure, crew discussed possible scenarios to be warry of on our route especially the MOCA on our route crossing into the country. ZZZZ ATC has a very difficult time understanding requests past basic communication. We discussed this as part of our threat forward briefing. Unlike some airports, there is no way for pilots to talk directly to the firefighters checking the airplane other than hand signals. At ZZZZ, the only way to communicate with the firefighters is through the Tower Controller. Depth of English can sometimes be unpredictable. Controllers switch between English and Spanish and their accent is very unusual. May be a very good idea to update the company pages that there needs to be extra clear and concise communication. Any delay or wavering in response should be rephrased to ensure that the message is understood between both parties.		ANTI ICE LEAK ENG R EICAS.

We stopped the airplane on Y did not set the parking brakes and had ARFF check the brakes he said the brakes were fine and we could continue to taxi in. We went through our brake cooling chart and requested another 30 minutes of cooling time at our present location. In the interim our number seven tire lost pressure. There was a lot of miscommunication with Tower and ATCs lack of ability to speak the English language. After our one tire lost pressure we requested to be tugged into the gate. We waited another 30 minutes cooling the brakes when the tug arrived brakes were all well below normal temperature.

At that time the Captain was the pilot flying (PF) and stated he had control of the aircraft. As the pilot monitoring (PM), I opened the QRH and read the corresponding page and actions. The Captain followed the procedure and reduced the #1 throttle until the light went out at an N1 of 80. A few minutes later as we were passing FL260 the light returned and the Captain further retarded the throttle to 76 N1. As we passed FL200 the light again came on and would not clear even with the #1 throttle at idle. We followed the procedure and shutdown the #1 engine. At this time we [requested priority handling] and received vectors direct to the ILS to Runway XXC. Once we completed the QRH the Captain passed the controls to me and we swapped the pilot flying and pilot monitoring roles. We executed an uneventful single engine approach to XXC and exited the runway. After a quick inspection from Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) we taxied to the gate and shutdown.No causal factors or than engine oil issues. After talking to Maintenance review they discovered it was a previous gripe from greater than 3 days ago.We were successful in this event because of the excellent training we received.		The flight was operating normally from ZZZ1. Our incident began as we were descending through FL 300 on the ZZZZZ 4 Arrival into ZZZ. At approximately XA40, the #1 OIL FILTER BYPASS light began flashing, then went solid. I was pilot flying (PF). We followed QRH procedures by reducing the power until the light extinguished. It did at 80% N1. Through FL 260, the light flashed on again. We reduced power further until light extinguished at 76% N1. Through FL 200, this repeated. However, once the #1 Thrust Lever was closed, the light remained on. We then followed QRH procedures to shut down #1 Engine. Observed oil temp steadily increasing throughout the event. It peaked at 110 when we shut down. Good shutdown with no further complications. We [requested priority handling] at that time, and received vectors to ZZZ. We then transferred control. First Officer (FO) was pilot flying. I was monitoring. We finished up cleanup items, and planned for a 15 flap landing. FO landing was excellent. We pulled off of XXC onto Taxiway X to allow Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to check us over as a precaution. After the all clear, we taxied to our gate with no further issues.Maintenance Chief at ZZZ looked up history of aircraft and noticed the OIL FILTER BYPASS light was a repeat issue.Change the filter.		B737-800 Flight Crew reported on arrival, descending through FL300 when the #1 Engine Oil Filter Bypass light illuminated. The flight crew ran the checklists and QRH, continuing to descend. The flight crew requested priority handling, performed an in flight shut down of the #1 Engine and made a precautionary landing at the destination airport.

Upon arrival to the aircraft, I noticed that the primary Auto Pressurization Controller was MELed, and the aircraft was in ALT mode. After reviewing the MEL, noting that one operational AUTO mode was required for Dispatch, and performing the pre-flight check of the manual operation, in accordance to the MEL, we departed ZZZ without incident. During the climb, passing through approximately FL 280, the Master Caution light began to flash, with 'AIR' displayed. Also flashing was AUTO on the pressurization panel. Upon reaching the assigned altitude of FL 310, the numeric digits on the pressurization panel turned to dashes, and the AUTO light illuminated steady. The First Officer (FO) immediately put the pressurization into manual mode. Initially the pressurization was steady as we completed the QRH Checklist accordingly, but a few minutes later, the FO had a hard time controlling the pressurization. After consulting Dispatch, we decided to descend, and return to ZZZ. ATC cleared us to a point on the ZZZZZ Arrival into the ZZZ area, at 12,000 ft., all the while, the FO was struggling to control the pressurization manually. We revisited the QRH for 'Uncontrollable Pressurization,' then completed the Diversion Checklist. I advised the Flight Attendants (FAs) that we were returning to ZZZ, as well as the Passengers. At 12,000 ft., the pressurization was still difficult to control, so after a brief discussion between the FO and I, I made the decision to [request priority handling], and was cleared to 10,000 ft., then to 8,000 ft. We advised ATC that we would require a full-length runway rollout, on Runway X, the longer runway, due to the fact that we would be performing an overweight landing. We were eventually vectored to a visual approach for Runway X. I landed the aircraft without incident, and taxied to the gate.		Experienced an AUTO FAIL with the Cabin Pressurization as we were continuing to climb to our cruise altitude of 39,000 ft. The aircraft was dispatched on flight to ZZZZ with MEL XX-XX-XX, operating cabin pressurization in ALT mode. Passing through approximately 29,000 ft., we saw the AUTO FAIL flicker on the Pressurization Panel then a minute or so later, a Master Caution with the AUTO FAIL remaining illuminated. Ran appropriate checklist (AUTO FAIL 2.4), placed pressurization in manual and used outflow valve to control cabin pressure. Contacted Dispatch and decided best course of action was to return to ZZZ. Initially coordinated with ATC to return to ZZZ and descend to 12,000 ft. (route limit for them at time). Completed Diversion Checklist as we turned around and descended. Was able to control cabin pressurization, but as we reached 12,000 ft., cabin pressure became more difficult to control so we descended to 10,000 ft. and [requested priority handling]. Coordinated with ATC for return to Runway X at ZZZ, due to heavy weight landing. Vectors, approach, and landing were uneventful and we returned to gate. Was little surprised to see an aircraft dispatched on international flight with this MEL.		Flight Crew reported the failure of the operational Cabin Pressure Controller during climb. With a failed CPC and the other CPC on MEL, the flight crew returned to departure airport.

Upon assessment, we concluded that we were rapidly losing engine oil from the number 2 motor. We continued to assess the situation to assure it was not an indication problem. When the quantity continued to drop and the oil temperature started to rise, the Captain called for the Low Oil Pressure QRH checklist. At this point, the Captain requested a descent to a lower altitude knowing that an inflight engine shutdown was likely imminent. We continued with the QRH procedure for low oil pressure, which led us to The Inflight Engine Shutdown Checklist. While running the Shutdown Checklist just prior to shutting the engine down we started to experience an alternating flashing red oil temperature and amber Oil Pressure indication. The engine oil quantity was now reading zero. Engine shutdown was completed, with coordination with ATC to divert to ZZZ. [Priority handling was requested] at this point. We coordinated with the Flight Attendants and advised them of the situation and to secure the cabin for landing in ZZZ. The Captain advised the Passengers via the PA, that we were diverting to ZZZ and that our #2 engine was 'Not quite performing to standards.' The Captain also informed them that fire equipment would be standing by, as standard operating procedure and not to be alarmed. Landing in ZZZ was uneventful. We cleared the runway and asked for ARFF to check the aircraft exterior for any abnormalities. None were noted. We were under max landing weight and ran made the brake cooling module, which allowed for a normal taxi to the gate. We taxied to the gate and deplaned.

We climbed to FL330 and leveled off for 10 minutes. We were then given a clearance to climb to FL350. Shortly after leveling off, we noticed airframe buffeting. We then noticed that the Number 2 Engine was at around 65% N1 and the white trend line was at the climb limit. The the auto-throttles disconnected. The no. 1 engine was at 95%. I moved the Number 2 throttle forward and aft, but could not get the motor to accelerate past 65% N1. The buffeting continued, all other engine indications were normal. We decided to run the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall checklist and ask for lower. When the power setting was reduced to 57% N1, the vibration stopped and the engine ran normally. We completed the checklist. At this point we were around 300 miles from ZZZ, or about 50 minutes from touchdown. We decided to continue on and [request priority handling]. We anticipated a normal landing but decided to treat it as a single engine landing and request Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting meet us upon landing. We ran the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist and the Non-Routine Landing Checklist. We landed normally and taxied to the gate after being examined by the Fire Chief.				Pilot reported engine vibration during final climb to cruise altitude. Flight crew reduced power until vibration stopped and continued to destination airport.

I followed the task card and was about to head to the back to do the inspection when I was told that another mechanic was already heading to the back to do the inspection. I left the breakers out and continued on to do other things on the aircraft. After the mechanic returned I was still busy working on other things and I am unsure if I reset the breakers and put the aircraft back into the normal position. I was later informed that the Aircraft had taken off and was diverted due to having issues with the Stab Trim System. I was ask if I had reset the breakers and I was unsure if I had. I immediately called the hotline and did the report on the phone.				Technician reported omitting the resetting of circuit breakers during a routine inspection of the Horizontal Jack Screw Assembly.

On take-off roll, after V1 and just prior to rotation, aircraft shuttered, and began vibrating. Take-off continued. Immediately after getting airborne anti-skid inoperative light illuminated. Initial assessment was a possible locked wheel, due to anti-skid failure during take-off. At this point, we did not suspect a blown tire and raised both gear and flaps normally. Continued the departure while referencing the QRH for anti-skid inoperative light. After completing the checklist, ran performance data planning numbers for ZZZ1. Landing performance did not allow continuing to ZZZ1. Coordinated air return to ZZZ with ATC and Dispatch. Due to the vibration we experienced on take-off, anticipated the possibility of a blown tire on landing. Due to this possibility, we [requested priority handling] to ensure priority response was available upon landing. To minimize impact on operations in ZZZ, coordinated to land Runway XX. Passengers were informed of the problem. Flight Attendants were directed to prepare the cabin for arrival, based on the possibility of the need to conduct an evacuation. Landing with anti-skid inoperative and landing with blown tire procedures were thoroughly reviewed and briefed. Arrival into ZZZ was uneventful. Upon configuring for landing, the right main landing gear indicator light did not illuminate. Back-up light on overhead panel showed landing gear down, continued with the approach. Upon landing, speed brakes were manually deployed and maximum thrust reverser was used. During rollout, aircraft vibrated significantly and pulled right, but was controllable, remaining on the center line. After the aircraft had slowed below 50 kts, very light braking was applied and aircraft was brought to a complete stop. Flaps were left at 40 to prevent any possible further damage if a blown tire had occurred. After landing, Flight Attendants called and reported that oxygen masks in row XX had deployed. ZZZ fire arrived immediately and informed us that the number three main tire was blown. Brake temperatures were negligible. We were also informed hydraulic fluid was leaking from the right main landing gear. Aircraft was shut down using normal procedures. Coordinated with Operations and initial plan was to tow aircraft back to gate with passengers on board. Maintenance arrived, and informed us that they would need to change the tire, at which point, I determined the best course of action was to have the passengers, deplane via air-stairs and take buses back to the terminal. Upon the arrival of the air-stairs, deplaning the passengers was uneventful. Throughout this situation, the performance of my crew was exemplary. Passengers were kept fully informed of the actions we were taking, but also apprised of the potential risks. Due to our early departure out of ZZZ (time), after landing, coordination with all the Ground personnel took quite a bit of time, but passengers were kept fully informed at every step of the process. Other actions taken: Requested runway inspections for both Runways YYL and XX. Coordinated for hydraulic cleanup on Runway XX. Given the initial indications, I would not change how I handled this situation. If we had suspected a blown tire, would not have raised the landing gear.		[Report narrative contained no additional information.]		B737-700 Flight Crew reported anti skid failure on take-off caused a blown main wheel tire. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

Gear selected down at approximately 14,000 ft. and 240 kts. Managed descent to 1,600 ft. and armed the approach. Prior to making procedure turn inbound at 5,000 ft., I asked Approach for present heading for two miles. 'Cleared as requested'. FO (First Officer) selected heading but 1,600 ft. remained in FCU with V/S defaulted at 2,700 ft. per min. Speed was selected to 200 kts. I suggested turning left direct ZZZZ when it was obvious we were no longer high on the approach. I called out low altitude at approximately 2,200 ft. and asked PF (Pilot Flying) to climb back up to 2,500 ft. We received a 'TERRAIN AHEAD' warning when we were close to 1,600 ft. Day Visual conditions and cleared for the visual at this point. Could see terrain at all times. Climbed back above 2,000 ft. and commenced approach. Stable and configured by 1,000 ft.We were kept very high by ATC. Bad descent planning and bad descent technique. First flight for the CA (Captain) for several months due to check pilot duties in the simulator. FO tired from early wake up call, and still new to Company. Ask ATC for lower sooner. Prepare and brief for slam dunk. Communicate better between pilots. Use better techniques for descending fast.				An Air Carrier Captain reported while descending on an approach they received a Ground Proximity Warning and climbed back to the appropriate altitude.

I taxied the aircraft to comply. The nose wheel skidded during my turn onto runway. My airspeed was low but the taxiway was wet (I include this as a possible contributing factor considered in retrospect). I lined up with the centerline and left my power near 40% because I expected a quick issuance of takeoff clearance. Tower quickly cleared us for takeoff and I pushed the TO/GA button while calling for takeoff power. Before I was able to state the N1 setting the aircraft turned sharply right and I discontinued the takeoff. I did not look at the N1 gauges since my attention was focused on regaining directional control and stopping the aircraft. We informed Tower of our rejected takeoff due to asymmetrical spool up and cleared the runway. We returned to the gate and called Maintenance. I called Dispatch and had a conference call with Chief Pilot in the (Control Center) and Maintenance Control. The aircraft was removed from service and we were assigned a replacement for our flight to ZZZ1. The Mechanic informed me that they found an error for the right auto throttle timestamped at the time of our takeoff.		We were cleared for takeoff on Runway XXR. The Captain was Pilot Flying. Captain lined up on the runway and brought both throttles to 40 percent N1 before calling for takeoff thrust. As the auto throttles advanced and were being set by the First Officer there was a severe pull towards the right side of the runway. The throttles were brought back to idle and Tower was notified that takeoff was rejected. As the Captain steered the aircraft back onto centerline we were instructed to exit at the first taxiway and turn onto taxiway X. We made a right turn onto the first taxiway when it should have been left turn to get to taxiway X. After the startle factor from the asymmetric thrust pulling us towards the edge of the runway I didn't catch the wrong turn in time.

Our Navigation Display showed us on the magenta course line, and we had no indication of a system malfunction at that time. We asked for and received vectors to the ILS final approach course for an uneventful approach and landing. After beginning vectors, we did receive an 'UNABLE RNP' EICAS message and on final, we noticed that the magenta line was a little to our left. Upon landing, we contacted ATC, Approach Control, to ask about the event, suspecting a possible system malfunction on our end. He informed us that the Aircraft Y behind us had experienced the same issue and that he suspected interference with the GPS signal, and was looking into it. He also said, and emphasized, that it WAS NOT A DEVIATION, since we were within a mile of our course throughout the event.				B777 Captain reported being informed by ATC that the aircraft was off course on the approach to land. Upon landing, the flight crew discovered through ATC that there may have been interference with the GPS signal. The flight crew also received an "UNABLE RNP" alert on the navigation equipment while on the arrival.

We did not answer the call due to workload and weather during the approach. After landing and taxiing off the runway, I contacted the #1 FA to inquire about the call. She communicated that they had experienced an odor event during the approach that started in the aft cabin and quickly enveloped the entire cabin. She described the odor as a 'dirty sock smell.' She indicated that the odor seemed to dissipate upon landing. We continued the taxi and parked at the gate. After the checklists were complete, I exited the flight deck and communicated further with the inflight crew. The description of the intensity varied from strong to mild depending upon the inflight crewmembers' past experience. I made my way up the aisle during the deplaning process, but could not detect any lingering odor. The FO (First Officer) did the same after the post-flight walkaround and could not detect an odor in the cabin.I called Maintenance Control and told them that we had experienced a fume/odor event during the approach. I wrote up the event in the maintenance logbook and filled out the form. We secured the aircraft since it was not due to go back out for several hours. Contract Maintenance showed up before we left the aircraft and I briefed them on the event. The entire crew regrouped and discussed the event in the jet bridge. All crewmembers communicated that they were feeling fine and had zero lingering effects from the event.				A320 Captain reported a fume event that was identified by the flight attendants as a 'dirty socks' odor during descent. After arriving at the gate, the flight crew contacted Maintenance to inspect the aircraft.

The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF). While climbing thru FL340 with the Autopilot and autothrottle engaged, we experienced a significant loss of electrical power. The autopilot and autothrottle disconnected, Master Caution illuminated with ELEC on my six pack along with numerous amber warning lights. We also lost most background lighting at this time. I stated 'your aircraft,' canceled the Master Caution, the FO stated 'my aircraft,' and took manual control of the aircraft. I contacted ATC to request a level off at FL350 and stated that we had a problem we needed to work on. My initial thought was that we had just lost a generator, but that it would be a quick fix. After focusing my attention on the overhead panel and seeing the many amber lights along with the loss of background lighting, I realized it was more serious. I positioned the APU switch to start and told ATC that we would need to return to ZZZ. I'm not one hundred percent positive that I [requested priority handling] with ATC at that point. I know I had hit the mic switch to talk to ATC with the intent to [request priority handling] when I heard the FO say 'I have nothing on my side.' I diverted my attention to the FO's side and could see that he had no flight instruments and was hand flying while looking cross cockpit at my displays. I will add at this point that for some reason, my audio panel kept switching from VHF1 to FLT on its own making communication with ATC more difficult. At this time I felt that it was better for me to fly and have the FO assume the role of pilot monitoring (PM). The FO suggested we descend, being concerned that the APU may not start and we may ultimately have a problem with the pressurization system. I wasn't too concerned that the APU would not start as we had not been airborne for long enough for it to be cold soaked, but I was concerned about overall fuel pressure to the engines as we had numerous fuel pump low pressure lights illuminated. I agreed and he began to coordinate for a lower altitude with ATC as I took the aircraft and directed him to check the QRC and open the QRH for the proper electrical checklist. After taking control of the aircraft, I found that I could not actuate the elevator trim using the switches on my yoke and asked the FO if his worked. He tried his and stated that his did not work either. We were both a bit unsure which checklist was appropriate as the Bus Switching (electrical) panel looked normal initially, and no lights were illuminated on the Generator Drive and Standby Power panel. However, from all appearances, we had suffered a major loss of AC power and were operating on standby power. We both agreed that, even though no Transfer Bus Off lights or Source Off lights were illuminated, the most appropriate checklist to start with was the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist. The APU started normally and indicated that the APU generator was available. After completing the initial steps of the checklist with no restoration of power, I had the FO hold the checklist and contact the flight attendants to let them know we were working an electrical problem, that we were returning to ZZZ, and to find out if they had enough lighting in the back and ask if everyone was okay. After taking control of the radios so the FO could run the checklists, I continued to coordinate with ATC for lower altitude, giving the requested info, and requesting Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) equipment meet us at ZZZ. Once level at 16,000 ft. and approximately 45 miles from ZZZ, I requested delay vectors for time to work the problem and had the FO take control of the aircraft. Just as I was relinquishing control, I felt the trim wheel move slightly. I thought the FO may had begun to trim, so I did not say anything. The FO then observed the same thing. My thought was that maybe the Speed Trim system was doing that, but unsure how it could have done that given the failure of AC power that we had. I knew that neither one of us had done it and that neither one of us had use of electric trim, so I elected to move both stab trim cutout switches to cutout, and remove it completely from the equation. I informed the Flight Attendants that we were still working our electrical problem and informed the passengers that we would be returning to ZZZ. I then elected to review the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist and determined we had both arrived at the same conclusion. Since it appeared as though we were on Standby Power, or some state in between, I decided to review the Additional Information at the end to the checklist, regarding the 'unlikely event that a landing must be made on standby power.' I'm glad I did that, as it would come into play later. At this point, I went thru the overhead panel to review all of the various indications we were presented with. The Window Heat panel indicated overheat on two of the windows, as expected with a loss of power. The Low Pressure light for Electric Pump 2 was illuminated on the Hydraulic panel. The pneumatic duct pressure needles were both pointing at the (approximately) 12 o'clock position, very unusually high. We were also noticing that the temperature in the aircraft was getting very warm. The FO attempted to adjust the temperature using the temperature control knobs, but that seemed to have no effect. I directed him to turn all three temp control knobs to the off position in hopes that the packs would regulate to 75 and 65 degrees respectively. That had no effect so I later directed him to turn the trim air switch off and leave it at that. We had no Pack or Zone Temp lights illuminated. We checked the pressurization system and it seemed to be functioning properly the entire time with no lights illuminated. We had fuel in the center tank, so all six fuel pump switches were in the on position, but at this point, four of the six had low pressure lights illuminated. The only ones providing pressure were the left center and forward pump in the left wing. The FO then brought to my attention that we were beginning to get out of balance on the fuel. I reconfigured the fuel panel to correct for that and continued to evaluate the problem. The AC and DC Metering panel had only the BAT DISCHARGE light illuminated. The TR UNIT light was not illuminated. I was confident that the BAT DISCHARGE light was due mostly to the APU start. The panel indicated -5 amps and 25 volts for the battery at this point. Gen 2 showed no frequency and no volts, but the GEN OFF BUS light for number 2 was not illuminated. Gen1 indicated good frequency and volts, but did not appear to pick up the load with the initial step of the checklist and the GEN OFF BUS light remained illuminated. At this point, we had the APU generator connected to Bus 1. It appeared to me that the majority (but not all) of the problem may have been with Transfer Bus 2. I did a quick review of the Transfer Bus Off checklist in hopes that it may be of some help, but ultimately we were stuck with what we had. I then decided to take control of the aircraft and directed the FO to sit back and methodically look thru all of our indications and verify that we were not overlooking anything.While the FO was performing that task, I communicated our request for the ILS XXC at ZZZ. We had just departed ZZZ and we knew that ZZZ was VFR. With the BAT DISCHARGE light illuminated, and the significant power loss we had experienced, I did not want to delay any further, so we informed ATC that we were ready to continue to ZZZ. I then transferred control of the aircraft and radios to the FO and requested that, with the next ATC controller, he confirm that they were aware we were a [priority] aircraft and we wanted the ARFF equipment to meet us. I accomplished the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist, coordinated with the Flight Attendants, and advised the passengers that we would be landing shortly and that they would see airport safety vehicles around the aircraft after we had stopped on the runway. I then took control of the aircraft and the FO resumed the duties of PM. As we were approaching ZZZ we were advised that the ILS was out of service on XXC and were asked if we would like XXL. Given our current circumstances, I wanted the longest runway available. The FO then asked for XXR and was told that the ILS XXR was out of service as well. Apparently the FAA was performing some flight checks of the equipment that night. I asked the FO to request the RNAV XXC, mostly just for initial lateral and vertical guidance, as we wanted a long final due to the hand flying and manual trim necessary for the approach. We discussed threats, I briefed the approach, and accomplished all normal checklists. Before beginning the approach, I reviewed with the FO what was in the Additional Information on the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist and that, in particular, the flap position indicator may be inoperative for us. We also discussed that the Speed Brake Do Not Arm light was illuminated, so I would not arm the speed brakes for landing and that I would need to manually deploy them on landing. I began to slow the aircraft and configure for landing on Runway XXC. The FO pointed out that we had proper indications on the leading edge devices, but no indication on the flap gauge for the trailing edge flaps. I let him know that with each flap selection, I could feel the pitch change anticipated with normal flap movement and there was no rolling tendency. Everything felt as though it was operating normally. Due to time constraints, I had decided not to run the Stab Inoperative Checklist, but I am aware that the Stab Trim Inoperative checklist states to plan a flaps 15 landing. Given that the weather and visibility at ZZZ was very good, unsure of anti-skid operation, and in consideration of everything else that was going on, I wanted the approach to be as normal as possible and elected to land with flaps 30. I was comfortable hand flying and the manual trim inputs required were very manageable. Much more so than in the sim. I informed the FO that if we needed to go-around for any reason, I anticipated not using full go-around power and that we would do things at a slower pace to account for the manual trim required. We landed safely on XXC and brought the aircraft to a stop. I retracted the speed brakes and directed the FO to move the flaps to 40. The FO communicated with ARFF while I quickly made a PA to the passengers and spoke briefly with the Flight Attendants. As we were waiting for ARFF to inspect the aircraft, I noticed that we had a TR UNIT and ELEC light illuminated now that we were on the ground. We got the 'all clear' from ARFF and had them follow us as we taxied back to the terminal.Cause: Electrical system malfunction.Suggestions: The electrical non-normals should have some notes regarding fuel balance. I know that is part of normal flying duties, but it is often difficult to analyze various electrical problems, and with everything going on, that can easily fall out of your crosscheck and be missed until the fuel is out of balance.	Reporter stated the root cause was not determined, but the issue was resolved by ground maintenance replacement of both generator control units and main bus tie breaker. Reporter commented that the checklists are not well designed to deal with this kind of electrical issue and the flight crew was unsure of the exact nature of the failure.	The incident occurred on Day, around XA30. I was the pilot flying (PF), and the Captain was the pilot monitoring (PM). We were climbing through flight level 340 when we heard a loud clunk with the loss of all electrical power. The power quickly came back quickly but my side of the aircraft was very degraded in the instrumentation I had. The Captain requested a level off at flight level 350 and I began to fly and level off the aircraft using the Integrated Standby Instrument System as I had a Primary Flight Display (PFD) and a Multifunction Flight Display (MFD) but no instrumentation or navigation on them. They appeared to look like they were stuck in the aircraft startup mode. The Captain immediately started the APU and reported to ATC we had an issue. Once we realized the aircraft was not going to recover itself through the backup systems, he [requested priority handling] and he took control of the aircraft as it was easier for him to fly then me at this time. The systems that I had on my side of the aircraft seemed to be hit or miss in what worked as I had a com 2 panel, but no nav 2 panel. We lost the transponder and altitude reporting system. Auto Pressurization seemed to be working as it was supposed too but a lot of warning and caution lights that were supposed to be working did not. In my limited experience with the airplane, it was very confusing in what exactly was happening to the electrical system.The Captain told me to reference the QRC and then the QRH. I asked him if he thought the dual loss of generator's was appropriate. He responded with it was and I began to run through the procedure. As I was running through the procedure, he requested a return to ZZZ and a lower altitude as I brought to his attention the APU may not start and if we lost the auto pressurization system it would be easier to control at a lower altitude. I worked through the procedure, and it did nothing to fix or alleviate the problem. I then glanced over the loss of a single engine driven generator and that procedure was almost a duplicate to the loss of all generator's procedure. The APU would not connect or at least showed no indication of connecting to the right side of the aircraft. We leveled off at 16,000 ft. and I told the Captain that none of the procedures were working and that I was comfortable flying the aircraft if he wanted to look over everything and see if I had missed something. He agreed and I took over the flight controls and radios so he could do the checklists without being distracted. We had ZZZ Center give us vectors around as it was easier than trying to get the aircraft into a defined holding pattern. The Captain ran through the procedures and got the same results as I did. We then evaluated what we had and decided the best place to land was ZZZ since the weather was VFR there. The Captain then took back over the flying duties and comms and had me look over the entire cockpit to see if either of us missed anything. Every switch and button was in its desired place per the checklist and normal operating procedures. There were no visible circuit breakers popped or any true indication of something out of place. After that I took over the radios and began to get ready to land at ZZZ. We requested ILS XXC but found out the ILS was decommissioned on that runway and XXR. We did not want to land on XXL as it was the shortest runway, and we did not know for sure what systems were actually going to operate normally. We then requested RNAV Z XXC and setup for that approach. The Captain flew the approach to landing perfectly and we stopped on the runway to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) check the airplane over. They found nothing visible and followed us to the gate. Cause: The aircraft is one of the oldest in the fleet.		B737-800 Flight Crew reported while climbing thru FL340 with the autopilot and autothrottle engaged, they experienced a significant loss of electrical power. The autopilot and autothrottle disconnected, Master Caution illuminated with ELEC on the six pack along with numerous amber warning lights. Flight crew returned to departure airport.

Initial takeoff normal. Airspeed alive call made. During takeoff roll we had an ECAM pop up. I believe this happened before 80 knots. I am unsure if I made the 80 knots power set call. Captain advanced thrust levers to TOGA. No continuing call made, but I understood the intention to go at TOGA. Engine 2 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) mode fault along with Engine 2 system fault at the bottom of the ECAM page. To be clear this is what the ECAM read after the Rejected Takeoff (RTO) as we had a chance to read it after stopping. Everything else seemed normal with the aircraft at this point. At this point an RTO thought popped into my mind. Being go minded this seemed like a reasonable response as the aircraft did not feel as if it was unable to fly. As we accelerated we heard a Bang. The Captain called reject and at this point the takeoff was rejected. This was during high speed regime. Unsure as to actual speed. No call made as I was distracted by the bang and ECAM. I advised tower that we were rejecting the takeoff and we taxied clear of the runway to a stop. Reading through the ECAM, we shut down Engine 2 and started the APU. A call to remain seated was made. I talked to the in-flight crew to see if they smelled or saw anything of concern. One crew member mentioned the smell of burnt rubber which I figured was somewhat normal as we had indeed heated up the brakes. After coordinating with company and ATC we proceeded back to the gate. We also, at this time made a PA to the cabin advising that we were returning to the gate. The aircraft taxied without any tactile indication that the tire was flat. Didn't find out about that until gate return. At the gate the Captain addressed the customers and told them as much as he knew about our next steps.				A320 First Officer reported a high speed rejected takeoff due to an engine failure. The engine was shut down and the aircraft returned to the gate for maintenance.

The bleed configuration was still the same from takeoff: engine bleeds on, APU bleed off, packs auto, isolation valve auto, recirc fans on, trim air on. Around this time we entered icing conditions and turned the engine anti-ice on. Moments later we received a call from the cabin. They reported a 'strong burning' smell, no visible smoke, and it was not obvious where it was coming from. While the First Officer (FO) and I began to diagnose the situation we received another call from the cabin indicating that odor was getting worse. The FO and I put our oxygen masks on, [requested priority handling] to return to ZZZ. Throughout the event the Flight Attendants (FA) reported difficulty breathing, dizziness, and one of them developed a nose bleed. We ran the non-normal checklist. The Flight Attendants reported that odor/fumes had improved in the back of the aircraft and the forward Flight Attendant stated it was no longer getting worse. The approach and landing was normal. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) did a thermal scan of the aircraft after we cleared the runway. Everything on the exterior of the aircraft appeared normal. We taxied to the terminal and deplaned normally. The Flight Attendants reported that none of the passengers had requested medical assistance. The number 4 Flight Attendant with the nose bleed reported they were in stable condition to complete the deplaning process and was treated for the condition afterwards.Communicating with the oxygen masks on is very loud and adds a distraction and barrier to communication. Task saturation was a challenge as well. Reinforcing the importance of following SOPs and using good threat and error management will help crews navigate events like these with a successful outcome.		During initial climb, Flight Attendants called to report an odor in the cabin. Captain and I donned our oxygen masks, [requested priority handling to departure airport], completed the appropriate checklists and returned to ZZZ without further incident.The only suggestion that I have is to train pilots exactly how to communicate with the oxygen mask on.		Air Carrier Flight Crew reported a Flight Attendant notification of a 'strong burning' odor in the cabin during initial climb. Flight crew returned to the departure airport where a safe landing was completed.

The mechanic that was on the aircraft came up to the flight deck. He checked for faults but nothing. The aircraft to our right was getting de-iced and we figured with the wind it probably injected a little of the de-ice fluid and it was going away. The mechanic released the flight saying it was probably deciding fluid. After we took off on the climb we noticed it came back and the Flight Attendants (FA) said they smelt it too very strongly towards door XX there was a faint smoke as well. Flight crew [requested priority handling] to turn back to ZZZ for safety. We accomplished the Fume Event checklist and the Overweight Landing checklist as well. Dispatch send landing data. We came back to the departure runway for a landing. We pulled off the runway. Fire crew then conducted there safety checks on heat and smoke and felt it was safe to return to the gate. We returned to the gate.		[This flight] was planned and released in compliance with FAR 121, the [company] Flight Operations Manual (FOM), and Boeing 777 Flight Manual.During pre-flight, an odor of unknown origin was noted in the cockpit and Maintenance Control was consulted. The conclusion provided by Maintenance Control regarding the odor was a suspected deicing fluid that had migrated into the pneumatic ducting. Considering the snow event at ZZZ the day prior, and that the aircraft had been on the ground in ZZZ overnight, the explanation seemed plausible. Maintenance Control provided a maintenance release document and the flight proceeded. After departure and upon climb out a strong odor and faint smoke was noted in the cockpit at the same time that a Flight Attendant in the AFT galley reported that there was smoke in the cabin. The Captain [requested priority handling to] return to ZZZ. The Fume Event checklist; and the Overweight Landing checklists were completed in addition to normal procedures. Runaway condition data was obtained and stopping distance was verified for ZZZ Runway XXC.The approach and landing was conducted and upon exiting the runway the aircraft was stopped to allow Airport Rescue and Firefighting to evaluate the aircraft with FLIR sensors. No fire or hotspots on the aircraft were reported by Crash Fire Rescue or observed by the crew. The aircraft was taxied to the gate. Customer service met the aircraft to accommodate the passengers and Maintenance Control was debriefed on the event. The flight deck crew was subsequently debriefed by the Chief Pilot and deemed capable of continuing the duty period. Threat and Error Management CRM skills were used effectively in all phases resulting in a successful outcome.		Air Carrier Flight Crew reported a fume event during initial climb.

After performing ECAM actions and referencing the communications (COM), it was a crew awareness item. Approximately 30 minutes later at the top of descent on the ZZZZZ arrival we received an ECAM of ELAC 1 Pitch Fault, autopilot off, Alternate law with all Protection lost. After performing ECAM and referencing the COM we decided that we were stuck in Alternate Law and the COM referenced us to perform the Alternate Law procedure. After going over that we decided that continuing on the arrival and landing in ZZZ was our best option. It was also a perfect weather day in ZZZ. We landed with Flaps 3 and also Vref plus 10 per the procedure. We requested priority handling knowing we would eventually land. Briefed the Flight Attendants that we expected a normal landing but they would see the crash fire rescue (CFR) trucks and if anything changed we would let them know. Also made a PA explaining what happened and also that they would see the CFR trucks and this was a precautionary situation but we expected a normal landing. We then proceeded to ZZZ and made a successful, normal landing in direct law. Continued to the gate with no further incidence after talking to CFR and releasing them.				A320 Captain reported the loss of both ELACs in cruise. The flight crew requested priority handling and continued to the destination airport in Alternate Law. A precautionary landing was made.

Spacing was too close and Tower directed a go-around for spacing. We were in moderate chop and also probably a bit of wake from Airbus. Airspeed fluctuated +10 kt. During go-around, thrust was advanced for climb but ATC then directed a turn and altitude that was below current altitude. Airspeed accelerated quickly and before flaps were retracted to 5 from 40. Result was flap overspeed of approximately 215 kt. at flaps 15. New FO (First Officer) shortly off OE (Operating Experience) was PF (pilot flying). Overbanked in left turn just far enough for GPWS warning for bank angle. I was working to retract flaps and lost SA and didn't realize the overspeed until GPWS. Flaps were written up for overspeed and the FO and I thoroughly debriefed the event.		We are making an approach to IAH in IMC conditions with thunderstorms in the area. Initially we were on the HTOWN Arrival to [Runway] 8R, but prior to WDLNS intersection, we were changed to [Runway] 8L approach. We were then following an A380 and ATC asked us to slow down. Around 5,000 ft. we were asked if we can slow down more. We opted to land with flap 40 to give us a slower final approach speed to accommodate the traffic separation.At 3,700 ft. we received approach cancellation with 'maintain 3,000 ft. and turn left heading 360' instruction. As I pressed [the] TOGA button and set flap 15, at that moment, I had a difficult time controlling aircraft from turbulent conditions and as to how much thrust to give so that we can continue descent to 3,000 ft. and make the left turn. I was in slight descending left turn as we continued to reconfigure to go around. My attention was focused on aircraft control due to [the] turbulent weather condition that we were in at that time. It felt like wake turbulence from aircraft we were following. We continued with left traffic pattern and landed on [Runway] 8R, this time with no further incident. I did not notice the flap overspeed until CA (Captain) told me after we landed. CA told me that I exceeded to approximately 215 at flap 15 setting, 200 kt. max.		B737 flight crew reported a flap overspeed occurred on go-around at IAH when spacing became too tight.

They gave the traffic a caution that A320 was on final and caution for wake turbulence. Shortly after that we received a TA and had traffic on downwind. It was hazy and we lost the traffic until 400 ft when my peripheral vision off my left had a Cessna 172 had turned final and was under our left wing within 100 ft. We are now parallel to each other. My First Officer (FO) had lost contact when the aircraft was on down wind and I was watching that I was stable since it is a short Runway. So, I lost contact of the traffic anticipating that they would be behind us rather than turn in next to us. My first thought was to go around however, if I did, this may have caused a catastrophic upset of the 172. It was a short time of 30 to 45 seconds when the 172 descended below our glide path. I was in such disbelief that traffic would turn into us rather than follow behind which would favor due to the winds. My big concern is that our passengers could have [found] this and put it out on social media. In the near future, I will not have tower let traffic turn into our position rather enter from behind.				A320 pilot reported NMAC on final approach.

When we arrived at the aircraft there was ground personnel inside the aircraft, APU was running and we were told that it had been running since the aircraft arrived the previous afternoon because of the temperature sensitive cargo. I was Pilot Monitoring for the flight so I took my seat and proceeded with the preflight procedures, at the time the ATIS was showing winds in the 20+ knot range with gusts to 30+ knots, -22 Degrees C and light blowing snow. I didn't notice any real moisture, mainly powdery snow blowing around. Refueling was taking place and the deicing truck was on its way. We completed all our preflight procedures, the Captain flying did the briefing and we blocked out at XA42Z. The deicing personnel asked if they could start on the right side of the aircraft while the air stairs were removed and the captain agreed. We followed the supplementary procedure for deice/ anti ice and to our knowledge the deicing started. There was a long delay with the removal of the air stairs and after a very long delay, during which time we saw the deice truck drive away and re approach several times, we found out the ground personnel were not able to remove the air stairs. Communication between ground personnel and flight deck was very limited however understandable given the weather conditions. During this time several calls were made to our company to try and get updates as we had no knowledge of what was happening on the ground, with trucks approaching and driving away from the aircraft without any updates. Eventually ground personnel managed to push the aircraft back away from the stairs, deicing was completed after several start-stop attempts, and we blocked out again at XE42Z.Prior to engine start as I turned on the engine synoptic page I noticed that the oil temperature was -21 Degrees C and commented to the captain something to the effect of 'the oil must be like treacle', and it would be a good idea to get the engines running earlier to get some heat in them, of course he agreed. After start, oil pressure went straight up to around 100 PSI and temperature immediately started rising, vibration levels seemed normal given conditions. By the time we taxied out oil pressure was normal and temperature was around 30 Degrees C and rising quickly. I checked the engine page three times by the time we arrived at the runway and all values seemed normal, no vibrations were felt and it all seemed absolutely normal.At the hold point, we contacted tower and were told to line up and wait on the runway. After approximately one minute we got our take off clearance, the engine synoptic page was on to check vibration during cold weather run up procedures, the captain did the run up whilst I handled communication, got the lights and looked for thrust set.Take off was uneventful and no undue vibration was noticed. During the climb out, as we reached flap retraction speed and went to climb thrust, I noticed the vibration indicators on both sides were showing 5.0 units each and immediately brought this to the captain's attention. The aircraft was also vibrating, mainly through the yoke and glare shield. We retracted flaps, changed frequencies and climbed to an initial altitude of 13,000 feet. I was expecting the vibration to subside as the thrust reduced during the level off however it actually became worse. ATC cleared us to climb further to FL230 and we did while investigating the issue. We eventually advised ATC of the issue and contacted the company to get Dispatch and Maintenance into the situation for concurrence and advice. ATC cleared us for a further climb to FL270 and that became our final altitude. After several discussions withDispatch, Maintenance and Duty pilot, and following procedures for 'ice removal from the fan whilst in moderate or severe icing' with no improvement, even though we were never in icing conditions but VMC, the Captain with concurrence from Dispatch and the rest of the crew decided to divert. ATC was advised, priority handling was requested, and we were cleared direct. During the turn I noticed that the oil quantity indication on the right engine had suddenly dropped to 0 and oil pressure was considerably lower than on the left engine, approximately 20 PSI less. This was also brought to the attention of the crew. The oil pressure on the right engine continued to drop until we finally landed, where the indicator showed 1 PSI and turned red, at which time the engine was shut down.After landing we advised the tower that we had lost oil from our right engine and recommended a runway inspection and also had ground trucks visually inspect the engines for any visual damage, of which none was found. We eventually shut down the left engine and were towed into parking where the aircraft was secured.		It was a very cold windy blowing snowy morning. We had arrived the [FBO] at ZZZ airport, at about XU:15 a.m. where the three of us operating crew were to be transported to the airplane. However, we couldn't gain access into the van because the door wouldn't open due to ice. We eventually gained access into the van through the front passenger door. We got to the foot of the airplane at XU:25 a.m and exited the van via the same way we got in. Got on the airplane and settled in. I was the third crew, I went out and did my walk around procedures in that brutal weather. Got back into the airplane, went through my supernumerary area security checks, bathroom, bunk area and all procedures. Went into the flight deck and told the Captain and First Officer that all looked good outside I sat in and took the observer seat and got settled. We discussed de-ice procedures and the current weather situation per Current ATIS which was blowing light snow and temperature in the negative. The brief and all checklists prelude taxi were done. We had blocked out and ready to go. We got deiced intermittently with no communication of fluid types and time. Air stairs wouldn't move away from the airplane due to the snow the previous night. So we sat there for over five hours from time of getting to the airplane to time we eventually got tugged out. We got fully deiced and no communication of fluid type and time of start and time of end. We had to keep requesting for this information. Ground handling around the airplane could have been better.We got ready for start up, engines got started. Pilot monitoring was on the secondary engine page where he monitored the oil temperature which were in the negatives. However before we taxied out both engine oil temperature indicators were in the positives. Taxiing out was good all the way to runway XYR. We talked about the static run up before takeoff and once we got our clearance to enter the runway, this was done on the runway and all engines indications were in the right parameters. Once we got takeoff clearance, we were on a roll and there were no abnormalities either by indication or by sound. We got airborne and once we got to thrust reduction height, thrust levers went forward and once flaps was to be retracted, Pilot Monitoring made mention right away about the engine vibration indicators. They were both at five units in the gray and right away you could feel the airplane vibrating even more visible over the control column and the glare shield.We climbed to 13,000 feet and even after the engine anti ice was turned off, the vibration was still there and indicating five units. Once we leveled off at thirteen thousand feet, rather than the vibration to reduce, it even became even more serious. At this time there was a discussion amongst us in the cockpit. ATC gave us further climb to FL270 in which Pilot Flying set the altitude in the MCP (Mode Control Panel) and we climbed. The vibration indicators went down to 4.8 units and at some point 4.5 units. We got to FL270 and then advised ATC we wouldn't be climbing further due to both engines vibrating. Captain advised to get a hold of the Company and then Dispatch and Maintenance also a duty pilot were brought on line. Fan ice removal procedure was done in accordance with FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) while we were on line with Maintenance. The vibration still continued, a request for priority handling was made and after all procedures and discussions were concluded,  with an agreement with dispatch, ZZZ1 was agreed to be the diversion airport. ATC was advised and we were told to proceed in that direction.Pilot Monitoring loaded the FMC got the weather and was all caught up. A brief was done and checklist followed. Before we started our descent in ZZZ1, we were already losing oil quantity on the right engine. Eventually it went to zero. As we descended into ZZZ1, oil pressure on the right engine was dropping and dipped even below 20psi. We landed andonce we turned out of the active runway XZ, onto [the taxiway], trying to get a parking spot, EICAS alert message came up with a beep beep and oil pressure read 0 and the Captain shut down the right engine. After this was done, the pressure read as 1 in the gray. PM (Pilot Monitoring) advised Tower about the situation and a possibility of oil on the runway. The tower sent out the inspection team to the runway and nothing was found. The left engine was also shut down while we were on the ground. The inspection and airfield operations team also inspected the exterior of our airplane and they said no exterior damage or leak they saw. Finally after being on ground for a while, we got a tug to tow us to a remote parking area.Can't tell exactly, however, we were made to understand by maintenance that the airplane had sat on the ramp for more 26 hours on the ground and the APU had been running the whole time in order to keep the cargo on board cooled at a certain temperature.I think the ground personnel and handling should be made to follow SOP and maybe some retraining should help.		B777 flight crew reported diverting after engine vibrations and erratic engine oil pressure and quantity indications were received after takeoff. Weather and temperature were extreme and likely caused the problems with ice on the engine fan blades and frozen oil coolers and oil filters.

This aircraft had a write up about excessive dead band in roll control in flight which was cleared by Maintenance. 30 ft. above ground I felt something is not right, and I felt my aileron had no authority. The aircraft jerked twice and was not responsive. Upon reaching 1000 ft, retracted the flaps and accelerated to 210 kts. During a turn to the left again, I felt the aircraft was not turning the way it should, even when I had good control column input. I remember reading the logbook about dead band in roll movement and realized I was in the same situation. Climbed to 8,000 ft. and asked for a few different headings from the Departure Controller to see if is getting better but no change. The turn was either sluggish to one side or sharp to the opposite side. Tried to get a phone patch to Maintenance Controller with no luck. Sent ACARS message to Dispatch and was given an instruction to land. On final approach I had 10 to 15 degrees right aileron input to maintain the final approach course. Landing was uneventful.		The Captain and I were performing originating Flight XXXX ZZZ-ZZZ1 on a very cold morning. On preflight we noticed a recent closed write up in the logbook involving roll control relating to a dead band in the ailerons on Day 0 and took note. On the walk around I noticed a fluid drip/leak on #2 Engine requiring an engine run per Maintenance Control prior to flight to ensure the leak didn't get worse. The leak stopped with the engine run. This event is unrelated to the event but added to our pre-departure duties. Engine start and pre-takeoff duties all normal. The flight control check felt normal on our Before Taxi Check. In fact we cycled through the control check approximately 3 times to circulate the hydraulic fluid being the first flight of the day and sub-freezing ambient temperature. The wind on take-off was 300@11 kts per Tower, a slight right crosswind to Runway XX.They gave us a heading of 260 degrees, a vector, with the take-off clearance. Immediately after rotation the Captain commented on the abnormal mushiness and lack of roll control. We cleaned up the aircraft at 1000 ft. and very gradually turned to a heading of 260 out of caution and to get a feel for what was actually occurring and continued to climb. Departure Control gave us a southerly heading, the Captain, cautiously banked the aircraft and maintained a controlled turn but still experiencing the non-linear roll in the control wheel. After rollout we tried engaging the autopilot. After a couple tries, the autopilot took the aircraft for a second then disengaged and put the aircraft in CWS (Control Wheel Steering) modes bank and pitch. We re-activated the flight modes Heading and Level Change to continue hand-flying the climb out of around 4000 ft. at this point.Departure cleared us direct to an eastbound fix on our route. After making the slow turn, we agreed to level off and start communicating a plan of action to make a return to ZZZ as the aircraft felt UNSAFE to fly and continue. We requested a heading and altitude while we sorted things out. We contacted Ops to relay messages to Dispatch our problem and get a phone patch. The phone patch I guess wasn't capable with ZZZ Ops for some reason and communicated through ACARS with Dispatch of our problem and intentions. They seemed onboard with our decision to return. We let the Flight Attendants (FAs) know about our return as well as an appropriate PA to the passengers. We requested and received radar vectors for the visual back to Runway XX after briefing, setup, and landing performance and checklists were performed. With the aircraft under safe positive control, we elected to not declare an emergency. Approach and overweight landing uneventful but required extra control and vigilance with the manual reversion like aileron control. Logbook entries were made.		B737-700 flight crew reported a dead band in the controls and unresponsive aileron control on takeoff. The flight crew made an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

This flight resulted in a return to the field for an issue with the main cabin door handle. Aircraft X was originally scheduled to depart ZZZ at XD59 local time. At about XA30 local time, I noticed that the flight was delayed for maintenance until XJ00. I confirmed the delay with the Dispatcher assigned our flight and then contacted crew tracking to remain at the hotel until the new departure time. The crew reported at the new time and began pre-flight preparations. As part of my Flight Attendant (FA) brief, I reminded the FA's to double check the door handle. Pre-flight proceeded smoothly and the flight pushed back at XI59 local. As we taxied out, there were no abnormal indications and we took off at XJ14 local. Our take off and initial climb proceeded with no abnormal indications. We departed via the ZZZZZ departure with the ZZZZZ transition. We checked in with ZZZ Departure, and were instructed to proceed direct ZZZ2 once passing 10,000 ft., and to maintain 11,000 ft.. As we were nearing 10,000 ft., the First Officer (FO), who was acting as Pilot Flying (PF), loaded direct ZZZ2 in the FMC and I verified it. As we were passing 10,000 ft. the FO executed the FMC. As I was reaching for the chime switch for the 10,000 foot chime, the number one FA called to notify me of the door handle issue. She stated that the main cabin door handle was moving upward and would not stay in the down and locked position. She further stated that they had to hold it down to keep it from moving, and that the force needed to hold it was increasing as we continued to climb. The FAs later stated that they were actually sitting on the handle and it was still moving. I acknowledged the issue and made the decision that we would return to the field. I instructed them to do whatever was necessary to hold the handle down and that I would get right back to them with more information. At this point, I informed ZZZ Departure of the issue, requested a decent and vector back to ZZZ. I then gave the FO the radios and asked him to request the trucks standing by to check the brake temperatures and to set up for an approach while I coordinated with the Company and the FAs. I sent dispatch an ACARS, called Operations to request a Gate. I called the FAs and briefed them on the return and then made a PA for the passengers. I then ran the overweight landing checklist and non-routine landing checklist. I calculated our landing weight as 158,200 lbs and our landing assessment was about 4,700 ft. Runway XXL is 14,511 ft., so there was plenty of Runway for a flaps 30 landing. The FO and I discussed the overweight landing during the approach briefing and he elected to land with Auto Brakes off to minimize the potential for hot brakes. I agreed since it was a long dry Runway. As I was finishing all the QRH checklists, we were on a vector to final, just about to join the localizer. I ran the decent flow followed by the before landing checklist. We checked in with the Tower and were cleared to land. Touchdown was slightly firm with a decent rate of 350 fpm. On rollout, the FO deployed the thrust reversers, but let the aircraft roll without brakes. At about 60 kts., He stowed the reversers as I called my aircraft and slowly started braking and came to a full stop on the Runway at the PA intersection, I made a PA asking the passengers to remain seated and reminding them that they will see safety vehicles. Our brakes were inspected and found to be within normal temperatures, and we requested that the trucks follow us to the Gate. We taxied to the Gate without further incident. The event was only related to the main cabin door handle. Since I believed this was mechanical, I don't know what could prevent this from occurring in the future.				B737-800 Captain reported an air turn back after the L1 Door Operating Handle would not stay in the closed and locked position. An overweight landing was performed at departure airport.

We thought this might just be a loud airplane.When we were at about FL216 I noticed our climb rate was zero and sometimes negative. There were tailwinds of approximately 50 kts. The Captain, also Pilot Flying (PF), selected speed from our current 320 kts. to 280 kts.. The aircraft initiated a climb but I don't recall climbing more than about 600 FPM and we didn't climb for long. Maybe a few hundred feet. I suggested to use vertical speed. The airspeed slowed as much as 260 kts. and we were climbing at a selected vertical speed up 1,200-1,500 FPM. I originally thought that we were having an auto flight problem, perhaps. I checked all the system pages and found them to be normal. The Engine Pressure Ratio was 1.34 I recall and thrust indication matched thrust lever angle cyan circles. At some point before this when the TAT reached 10 Degrees C, I had turned on the engine A/I. Both PFDs and the standby indicator matched airspeed indications. Finally, I had the idea to turn off the dome light and turn on the ice light and wing lights. I saw a large piece of clear ice on the ice indicator and it extended horizontally approximately 1 inch per side. The wings were somewhat hard to be sure but looked to have a good amount of clear but lumpy ice on them. I turned on the wing A/I after mentioning to the Captain.What I think happened was that the pitot tubes (all three) must have been frozen over and were no longer indicating accurate airspeed. Maybe the engine inlet sensors also as the Engine Pressure Ratio was lower than I would have expected and it increased some minutes after exiting the icing condition. I believe our airspeed was far higher than indicated as I've never heard wind noise that loud in the cockpit before. The plane seemed to not have enough power to maintain an altitude of FL 290 and had full power going Mach .78. After a few minutes the aircraft seemed to fly better and although Engine Pressure Ratio was now limited to I believe 1.44, the engines did not need to be at max thrust.This is a hard situation to fully understand because I'm not sure if the icing and its weight and drag were a larger factor or that I believe all three airspeed indicators might be iced over.				A320 First Officer reported excessive wind noise on climbout. Investigation determined that they were flying in icing conditions and were experiencing erratic Air Data Information due to all three Pitot Tubes frozen. The flight crew performed Anti Icing procedures and continued to destination airport.

At approx. 400 ft. AGL, the aircraft rolled left, then immediately right. The airspeed decayed then accelerated. I noticed the airspeed was now at 210 and the flaps were still at 25. I pitched up to avoid any further overspeed and asked for flaps 5 (should have said 15). My First Officer (FO) repeated my request questioningly, or rather confused. We were now at about 600 ft. I said we need flaps moving up now! My FO astutely recognized the reason for flap retraction below 1,000 ft. and complied. FO retracted to each Gate announcing as he did so. At 1,000 ft. my FO advised, The flaps are still at 2. I said; 'Move the handle back to 5. I will maintain 210 kts. Now try 10; Now try up. The flaps did not move. They were uniformly stuck at 2. No needle split. We told ZZZ Departure we wanted to stay at 3,000 ft. for flap problem. They asked if we were requesting priority handling. YES was our response. We requested diversion to ZZZ. We began the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree QRH Checklist. Once we got weather for ZZZ, we agreed winds were too gusty and headed for ZZZ1, where winds were much less. We requested holding at ZZZ1 - ZZZZZ fix on the XXR ILS to burn fuel in order to avoid an overweight landing. Once below, we landed on XXR uneventfully.		Took off from ZZZ2 Runway XXL, Flap 25, 737-800 with gusty winds. During climb out, the flaps failed to retract from the 2 detent. Crew recognized failure, requested priority handling, requested divert to ZZZ. Upon further discussion Crew decided new divert would be ZZZ1. Captain flew aircraft on northerly vector toward airfield, and First Officer ran the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree QRH Checklist. Requested to hold at ZZZZZ intersection on XYR ILS to burn approximately 8,000 pounds of fuel. Received performance data for flaps 15 Non-Normal, Brake Cooling. Uneventfully flew approach and taxied into the Gate. Certain tragedy averted.		B737-800 flight crew reported aircraft control difficulty after takeoff. It was noticed that the Trailing Edge Flaps did not retract fully and were stuck. The flight crew requested priority handling and made two diversions due to weather before making a precautionary landing.

On departure out of ZZZ at around 23,000 feet, we got a Brakes Hot ECAM. The temp on the right main gear inboard brake showed 400 degrees. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying. I coordinated with ATC to level off and we started slowing down so that we could drop the gear per the ECAM. As we were slowing down, the First Officer told me to take the airplane as she had just lost both of her screens. She selected the Autopilot to AP1 as I verbally told her I was now Pilot Flying. There was no initial ECAM associated with her display losses. Her screens came back but she informed me that her speed tape was missing and information was incomplete and not reliable. The ride was deteriorating rapidly at 23,000 feet with moderate turbulence and a fire. Our radios had a lot of static and communications with ATC was difficult, so we asked for a change in altitude. The Brake Temperature went down for a few seconds to 200 degrees making that ECAM go away but then it came back just as quickly. As I was still above 240 knots trying to slow down and maybe try a different altitude we got an ENG 1 EGT OVER LIMIT ECAM. We noticed the EGT high (at least 650 degrees) with the red tick showing. Our to do step said: THRUST LEVER (affected) - BELOW LIMIT. Retarding the number one thrust lever to idle brought the EGT back in the green.We requested priority handling and asked for immediate vectors back to ZZZ. The Brakes Hot ECAM meanwhile went away so we no longer needed to think about dropping the gear. But now we started getting a NAV ADR 2 FAULT ECAM. The ECAM would stay on a few seconds but then go away before we could accomplish any steps. This kept happening repeatedly. At one point it did stay on long enough that we were able to do the first to do step, AIR DATA SWTG(SWITCHING) - F/O 3. This seemed to help stabilize her screens, however the ECAM kept coming up but then would go away on its own before further steps could be accomplished. Eventually it stopped popping up. We did an uneventful SE ILS to just above minimums on Runway XXL in ZZZ. The fire trucks gave us the all clear and we taxied to the gate. To get three completely unrelated problems within a few minutes of each other while airborne is something that I have never personally experienced until now.				A320 flight crew experienced three unrelated systems failures after takeoff and elected to return to the departure airport.

The aircraft had 26 Passengers onboard and was pretty light with fuel. As airspeed passed 300 KIAS, the aircraft began to oscillate in an up/down motion. Very steady and cyclic. Each movement was identical. It felt as though we were passing over very symmetrical chop on water. At first we thought it was turbulence but realized this was not the case due to the uniformity of the motion. After an assessment and some conversation between the two of us, we thought we could have a problem with the aircraft. We reduced airspeed to 280 KIAS and pitch to 1,000 FPM. When the aircraft decelerated through 290 KIAS, the movement ceased. Engine vibration showed no more than 1.7 and was less when power was increased to try and continue climb. At this point the oscillation began again and was just as steady as the first time. No vibration was felt through this entire event. Just the steady oscillation/up & down bumping. We both agreed that we were uncomfortable continuing to ZZZ1 as a serious airframe or flight control problem could exist. We made the decision and requested priority handling with ZZZ Center, and they gave us expedited handling back to ZZZ. We also notified Dispatch via ACARS, and they provided us with landing data that we cross referenced with performance data. No adverse issues were encountered during descent and uneventful landing at ZZZ. Maintenance met aircraft at Gate, and we briefed them on what the problem was. Logbook write up was made by me, and Maintence verified the write up had the information they needed while we all discussed the issue in the jet way. Aircraft was towed off the gate and taken to hangar, and we continued on to ZZZ1 in a replacement aircraft.				B737 Captain reported uncontrollable oscillation in flight followed by engine vibrations. An air turn back and precautionary landing were made at the departure airport.

This was after we had been vectored due to airport saturation. We set up for the approach and briefed it. The missed was briefed and it was 4,000 ft. We were vectored onto the approach just outside of the FAP, while we were turning onto the inbound leg the autopilot disconnected due to what I expect was turbulence, and would no re-engage. The Captain hand flew the rest of the approach. When we were approaching the MDA, approximately 200 ft. above, we got a TERRAIN, TERRAIN alert and I immediately called for a go around. The go around was performed perfectly except Tower told us to climb and maintain 3,000. I never adjusted the MCP as we were busy with the missed procedure. Tower queried us about the altitude and said to just maintain 4,000. They then asked us about retrying the approach, we decided as everyone seemed to be going missed, to divert to ZZZ. The flight landed uneventfully at ZZZ.				B737 pilot reported receiving a terrain alert while on final approach, resulting in a missed approach and diversion.

My last flight highlighted the issues. Landing on XL in ZZZ, the ATIS was reporting +TSRA and 2 1/2 miles visibility. We were cleared for the ILS Runway XR. At minimums, the Pilot Flying (PF) announced 'landing'. While the runway was somewhat distorted by the rain piling up on the windshield, neither of us felt it was bad enough to call for the go-around. Here lies the problem with not treating the windshields with a hydrophobic coating. The crew is lulled into a false sense of security to continue the landing. However, I believe, based on experience, that the Pilot's depth perception is severely and unknowingly impaired by the distorted view.This was just what we experienced. Just before touchdown, we got a Sink Rate Aural Warning. It was too late in the flare to initiate a go-around, as we touched down almost immediately after the warning.  As you might imagine, it was a hard landing. What was unnerving to us both was that neither of us had the slightest inclination that the aircraft was sinking. I attribute this to our distorted view through the windshield.  We felt that we had adequate visual reference to continue the landing, but clearly, we unknowingly did not. I have seen this happen other times as well and always in heavy rain. I happen to know that other airlines maintain their windshields better than we do. When I observed (other carrier) land immediately after us in the same conditions, they had a much more normal touchdown. I have worked for operators, in the past, who maintained the hydrophobic coating and never had any issues landing in heavy rain. We also didn't even have windshield wipers on our aircraft. I strongly believe Company is assuming unnecessary risk by choosing to operate this way.				B737-800 First Officer reported vision problems caused by the hydrophobic coating on the windscreens caused misjudgments and an excessive sink rate during landing. A hard landing was entered into the log book for maintenance action.

We were able to land safely.After our ECAM warning on our final approach, we executing a go-around so we could complete our ECAM procedure. Since we lost our green system we were unable to retract our main landing gear. The ZZZ airport is a very short landing runway and requires medium auto braking system but we lost our Normal/Auto Braking System, Nose Wheel Steering, and partial Flight Controls. We are trained to go and hold when a problem arises and complete our checklist; however, I had to make a quick decision to divert because we couldn't retract our landing gear and was burning a lot of fuel due to the drag. The FMS fuel calculation was inaccurate due to the gear extended in the down position. When we landed, we had approximately 7,200 lbs. of fuel remaining. If I requested a holding and we took our time to do our checklist, we would have lost a lot more fuel and could have run into more problems.I suggest that more fuel be allowed for all flights in the event of an emergency in the future.

We switched to Tower after [Taxiway] XY and assumed - expectation bias - that Aircraft Y and Aircraft X were the only two aircraft on frequency. Airport was not very busy. Aircraft Y was cleared for takeoff and as they powered up we were told to 'line up and wait, Runway XXL.' We completed the before-takeoff checklist and as we turned south on [Taxiway] XZ to cross [the Runway] XXL hold-short line - I was FO (First Officer) - I said, 'Final's Clear.' However, we did note and talk about that there was an aircraft on final. We assumed - incorrectly, expectation bias - that this aircraft was on approach to [Runway] XXR. I assumed this, since we never heard Tower say something to the effect of, 'Aircraft X, Aircraft Y on five-mile final.' I'm also unsure if there were any transmissions between Tower and Aircraft Y that we heard, until we were taking the runway. Lastly, if I remember correctly, ATIS was reporting [Runway] XXL departures and [Runway] XXR arrivals - not that this means that an aircraft couldn't land on [Runway] XXL, but it added to expectation bias.As we continued south on [Taxiway] XZ the lights appeared to be trending toward our runway. At the point we started to question if this aircraft was landing on our runway, we heard Aircraft Y transmit, 'OK Tower, what do you want us to do?' Tower then stated, 'Aircraft X, continue across to exit runway... Aircraft Y, go around.' At this point, Aircraft Y was probably on a one-mile final. I don't recall exactly the amount of time that elapsed between us clearing onto [Taxiway] XA. However, it seemed to be about six to nine seconds. I could see the large Aircraft Y go around at about 100 ft. above where we just were.I think that we should have stopped the aircraft and asked Tower to clarify if the aircraft on final was landing on [Runway] XXR or XXL. Due to darkness and the fact that I don't normally fly at night nor do I get the sight picture of taking the runway with an aircraft landing on that same runway, it is difficult to visually confirm if they were landing on [Runway] XXL or XXR. Stopping the aircraft would also give us more time for this situation to play out and to communicate. It was just a compressed timeline and our brains could not take it all in during that short period. We never saw or realized the lights of Aircraft Y, until we were approaching the hold-short lines and by then it was taking us by surprise. We did not realize any aircraft was on final until that point.On the ATC side, I would like to understand their procedures. After some research, I am curious if Tower is allowed to issue line up and wait, LUAW, clearances during night and periods of low visibility. Additionally, I thought if they instructed an aircraft to LUAW, they had to add, '...aircraft on XX-mile final..' I never heard if Tower - we were not on frequency yet - issued Aircraft Y a 'continue' or a 'cleared to land' clearance. I'd be curious to get those transcripts.I'm also wondering if any air/ground/runway collision avoidance systems in the Tower were activated? Or was the Aircraft Y crew the last link in the chain that prevented this? Was there another controller in the Tower that saw this happening? Why did they issue us a LUAW with an aircraft on such short final for the same runway? Why did we even need to LUAW - there were no delays or backups? Did Aircraft Y sidestep? I have noticed an increase in new controllers - was this a new controller? Maybe they lost situational awareness on how far from landing Aircraft Y was. I really have more questions, since this could have turned out disastrous and my guess is this isn't the first time it has happened. My trust in ATC was somewhat high for Tower controllers. I've heard plenty of new Ground controllers struggling lately, but I assumed the Tower controllers were on ahigher level for a place like ZZZ. This has really opened my eyes to how the next aviation accident may play out and serves as significant lesson learned for me.		We were cleared for 'line up and wait' on [Runway] XXL with an aircraft on about a two-mile final for the same runway. When given the clearance, we both acknowledged the runway and noted the aircraft on final. Due to the dark and angle of the aircraft, we thought he was lined up on [Runway] XXL. Aircraft Y queried Tower as to what they wanted him to do. At that point Tower realized they put us in position incorrectly and asked us to expedite across the runway. When we got on the runway we also recognized the mistake. I tried to expedite across but the engines were at idle thrust and did not spool up in time. Tower sent Aircraft Y around when they were about 1/2 mile out.Suggestion: Better communication and coordination between Approach and Tower when landing aircraft on [Runway] XXL during an early morning push.		B737-700 flight crew reported being issued a line up and wait clearance from the Tower Controller while another air carrier was on short final for the same runway. The flight crew continued across the runway per ATC instructions and the other air carrier executed a go-around.

I was jumpseating for personal travel. This event started with a late flight plan. The Captain reported a long call to Dispatch in order to reconcile the release with the deferred items and pilot actions, and came to the aircraft with a list of threats to brief -  foremost the weather and the deferred bleed procedure. He made the decision that the departure time would be pushed until everything was properly briefed to mitigate the threats and everyone was on the same page. As I was in the observer's seat I was taking care of printouts, the Maintenance Release being relevant to this report. The right engine bleed was deferred and required pilot actions to configure prior to takeoff and after takeoff, as well as a packs off takeoff. There was discussion on the configuration, but all three of us read the pilot actions and came to agreement. During the pre-departure brief I caught two errors, including incorrect departure altitude set at 3,000 ft. instead of 23,000 ft., and preliminary takeoff data conditions. The Captain also noted the SID altitude on his takeoff brief. Taxi out went well with good CRM.Approaching the runway, the Captain called for the aircraft to be configured per the Maintenance Release. The FO (First Officer) started the configuration and asked if I concurred with what I saw in reference to the Maintenance Release pilot actions. I said that it appeared that the APU bleed valve was configured improperly, per what I was reading in the flight manual and Maintenance Release and that was corrected. The FO then pulled up the packs off non-normal checklist to configure for that. I noted the caution at the top noting that this was a highly unusual procedure and care should be taken. The FO completed page one, and then asked the Captain if he could override the checklist. I asked to see page two which had not been pulled up, but the checklist was overridden.Due to the low level windshear reported, the Captain called for a Vr max takeoff, and led a brief review of the callouts and conditions. On the takeoff roll we experienced a rapid performance increase, and the calls of 100, V1, Vr were made. At 147 kt., Vr max, the FO called rotate, and then appeared to have said something I couldn't hear. The Captain had started his rotation but looked over to query the FO. Due to a slow rotation and then an almost immediate 30-kt. performance increase from the gusty winds coming over the ridge, the aircraft came close to a flap overspeed reaching 194 kt. The Captain smartly and smoothly increased the pitch to arrest the speed increase, stopping at 20 degrees nose up. Departure was contacted and we began a turn to the east.On the ground there had been a decision to not start reconfiguring until after the flaps were up, which on this departure could not start until 3,000 ft. This altitude was reached very quickly due to the TOGA takeoff, subsequent delayed rotation and pitch attitude, with a VVI (Vertical Velocity Indicator) around 5,000 - 7,000 ft. per minute as I recall. At 3,000 ft. the Captain started calling for flaps in sequence, and at 4,000 ft. the FO started reconfiguring the bleed valves per the Maintenance Release. I could feel the cabin pressure altitude rise and passing 6,000 ft., commented that the packs were still off. They were selected on at 7,000 ft. and I felt the pressure bump at 9,000 ft.Passing 25,000 ft., I initiated a conversation to talk about the positive crew communication and also asked the FO to pull up the packs off non-normal so that I could see page two. The FO pulled that up and on page two was a caution saying to select the packs on prior to 3,000 ft. to prevent a depressurized climb. Not stated was that delayed selection risked automatic mask deployment. The FO stated that he recalled turning them on at 4,000 ft., and noted that they were definitely on prior to 10,000 ft. When he closed out of the checklist he noted that it popped up in EICAS as an uncompleted non-normal, something that had not happened the first time as the checklist was overridden prior to completion.The crew was attempting to take their time and ensure that all procedures were practiced safely, but the omission of page two of the checklist likely set up the situation where packs were not selected on after wheels up, and at the latest promptly upon reaching acceleration altitude. This almost led to an undesired aircraft state and an additional startle and surprise event at the cabin pressurization alert altitude and subsequent mask deployment. This situation was compounded by the weather threat and the Vr max takeoff, combined with a non-standard verbalization after Vr.		Complex departure/jumpseater. Aircraft X was an unusual segment in many aspects for me at the very least because we departed using Runway XXR, which I had never done in my roughly seven years in base. To start the operation there was a gate change and a late flight plan, which of course is something I have seen many times. Workload management was an immediate concern for us. I remember during a debrief complimenting Person A on his demeanor when we first met. He was relaxed and in absolutely no rush, which set the tone for me. The threat level was high especially during taxi and climb-out due to a complex MEL, weather, unique departure, and terrain considerations. We specifically briefed the threats and emphasized Threat and Error Management with regard to accomplishing MEL tasks after our turn to the east so as to focus on the departure turn and agreed we would finish required procedures after turning eastbound on the departure. As a crew we trapped an error, switch position with regard to MEL, prior to takeoff and to our knowledge accomplished all required tasks during the takeoff and climb phases.Additionally I was reminded recently that we had a jumpseat rider Person B, a nice guy, and after chatting with Person A, we agreed he was a bit zealous as a jumpseater. The night before we flew he sent us each an email letting us know he would like to ride the jumpseat and use the bunk. He made himself known at the gate, followed me down to the airplane and sat in the observer seat chatting while I was trying to set up and catch up. I had to let him know this is what I was trying to focus on before the chat ceased. He was eager to help us which was great, so eager in fact, he was referencing the Maintenance Release/MEL. In addition, if I am not mistaken, he was referencing a 777 flight manual on his iPad - he informed us he was a 320 Captain - as we taxied out. After the departure, he commented about cabin pressure rising before the packs were turned back on normal post takeoff per procedure. Later in the climb, he asked me if I could pull up the supplementary checklist for the bleeds off takeoff which we had referenced. This led me to believe he thought we did something incorrectly. We were not aware of nor was there any indication we did anything incorrectly. At the time I thought this was peculiar but had no issue doing it. He seemed to be verifying we complied with the procedure. As the trip progressed, Person A and I recounted our experience with Person B on the jumpseat and thought at times he was a bit wound up and hence distracting. Again, a very nice guy but would be reluctant to want to have him ride on the jumpseat again.		B777 Flight Crew reported confusion with the departure and after takeoff procedures due to a deferred engine bleed system. The cabin altitude reached a higher than desired level until the air conditioning packs were turned back on. The weather, nonstandard verbalization during takeoff, and the jumpseater may have also been additional factors.

There were a number of amber ECAM Messages that did not appear to be related. The #2 generator dropped off line. EPR Mode failed and we placed the engines in N1 mode as directed by the ECAM. At some point the FAs (Flight Attendants) called to say they noticed a loss of electricity and I told them to please standby as we were working the issue.We tried to reset the #2 generator it dropped off 2-3 seconds after re engagement. The Captain started the APU and it did not automatically bring its generator online. We attempted one more generator reset on #2 and on the second time It failed 2-3 seconds after re engagement the APU generator came online and began to power the right side of the aircraft.Due to the EPR failure we matched the throttle N1 settings and decided that we had maintained aircraft control. Since the FO (First Officer) side had the ACARS written up I offered to fly the aircraft so the Captain could begin coordinating with Dispatch so we transferred aircraft control. An ECAM message appeared me told us to turn off FAC 2 but I do not recall what ECAM that was. Other ECAM messages that I can recall were displayed include: AUTO FLT YAW DAMPER 2AUTO FLT RUD TRIM 2 FAULTNAV LS TUNING DISAGREE with check BARO REF Once we had two generators online and we were confident the aircraft was in a flyable condition the Captain discussed with Maintenance and Dispatch we decided to land at ZZZ due to greater support there.We flew vectors to the ILS XXC to and uneventful landing. ARFF vehicles met us when we cleared the runway and allowed us to proceed to the gate.We were later dispatched on another aircraft to ZZZ1 2 hours later.				First Officer reported loss of #2 Generator in cruise. The flight crew was able to bring the generators back on line and completed a diversion and landing.

Approach Control cleared us direct ZZZZZ, and cleared for the visual approach RWYXXR. The first officer set 1,700 ft. on the FCU and called '1,700' and I responded '1,700'. This was the first mistake and the root cause of this event. I should have caught the error and corrected it. But I didn't and I assume full responsibility for it. The First Officer started the descent to 1,700 ft. and we configured the aircraft to CONFIG 2/Gear down. The controlled called us with an altitude alert stating that the Minimum Vectoring Altitude in the sector was 2,500 ft. and we were at 1,700 ft. At that time we realized that we were too low and the First Officer instead of calling for a Go Around tried to pull the nose up. The autopilot disconnected and the auto thrust system went into Thrust Lock mode with the associated ECAM warnings. At that time I called for the Go Around. A Go Around was performed and we were vectored back for a full ILS approach to Runway XXR. The landing was done uneventfully this time. The First Officer remained the Pilot Flying and completed the landing.				A320 Captain reported a Too Low Warning was issued by ATC while on approach. A missed approach was accomplished and another approach was completed.

After the initial push back from the gate, the tow truck was disconnected and during the after engines start checklist flow, the Six Pack was pushed to test to discover that the Overhead AUTO SLAT FAIL Amber Light was ON. QRH was complied with, and it showed that one of the dual channeled systems had failed. We contacted Maintenance Control via DISPATCH to notify them of our status. Maintenance Control recommended that we return to gate to have Maintenance Technicians trouble shoot which channel or system failed. We coordinated with Operations for a gate return. The AUTO SLAT FAIL failed system was deferred and MEL with the back up or secondary system operating normal. So, we pushed back the second time, started both engines, ran all the appropriate checklists, Operations check normal. Now on the runway, cleared for takeoff, thrust applied, TOGA button pushed, I as the Pilot Flying (PF) crossed check as always my PFD indicated airspeed with the Standby Indicator's airspeed as the First Officer who was the Monitoring Pilot (PM) called out 100. Air Speeds checked correct all around. However, right at rotation, I lost the vertical guidance of the Flight Director but I continued the rotation and takeoff as I called out vertical guidance lost. As I continued the climbout passing through 10,000 ft. and hand flying, I confirmed several times to making sure the airspeeds and aircraft attitude information matches that of the standby instrument and the FO's (First Officer). Confirming that the FO's flight director is intact and correct. I transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer with his Flight Director as the MASTER and B autopilot switched ON as I resumed communications albeit my fumbling with an inop PTT and hand mike and running of the checklists. Just then I noticed the amber SPD LIM indication on my PFD. All the while the airspeed indicators were all reading the same. SPD LIM QRH could not be found but I knew the common denominator of what failed had to do with airspeed like minimum speed reversion. With the situation at hand, it did not occur to me to run the memory items for airspeed disagree because all the indicated airspeeds agreed. Not long after passing through FL200, we started to get intermittent short bursts of left stick shaker with minimum speed limit indicator popping out but the airspeed matches the rest. So, I took out the QRH and ran the Airspeed Disagree checklist.I decided in collaboration with the FO to return to ZZZ. Briefing was given to the Cabin Crew, Dispatch was notified, and priority handling was requested from ATC with a return to ZZZ. The FO did a very beautiful landing especially in an overweight status. We asked the fire truck to check our wheel wells including temperature checking our main wheels. The fire truck advised us that the temps are safe to continue taxi to the gate. For some reason I cannot recollect, I ran the Brakes Cooling Chart forgetting that it is for RTO only because I just wanted to make sure we are always in a safe operating mode.We taxied safely back to the gate with the fire trucks right behind us. Engines shut down, all checklists complied with, Dispatch, Maintenance Control and Operations were contacted.				B737 NG Captain reported a gate return for AUTO SLAT Fail. On takeoff, the Captain reported vertical guidance was lost along with unreliable air speed and the flight crew returned to land at departure airport.

After Normal easy landing in the touchdown zone at the 1,000 ft. marker, normal auto braking applied, spoilers deployed normally, and auto brakes came off when manual braking was applied. Slowing through 80-60 kts., transferred aircraft control to the me, the Captain. At this point is when the aircraft started to shutter heavily like maybe we had a blown nose tire. I continued down Runway XX slowing the plane to less than 20 kts. while the shaking dissipated. We made a right turn off at Taxiway XY using differential breaking as there was no nose-wheel steering capability and cleared the runway, stopping short of Taxiway XX On Taxiway XY. We informed Tower we may have blown a tire, and needed to be inspected. We made a PA to the passengers that we may have had a tire failure and would need to be towed to the gate once Maintenance inspected us. We called Company Operations and requested Maintenance to inspect us and coordinated for a tug. 2 Port Authority trucks inspected us and informed us that we had a part/piece hanging down behind the nose wheel. APU was started, we shut the engines down, Company Maintenance arrived and informed us through inter-phone that our nose scissors bolt had came out and the scissors disconnected/came apart. Company Maintenance reconnected the scissor arms and towed us to Gate XX for a normal gate arrival and passengers, deplaning normally through the jet-bridge. The process from after landing to the gate took 40 minutes. We did not disrupt any traffic landing or taking off from ZZZ. A Logbook entry was made at the gate for nose scissors bolt missing causing linkage to separate and the aircraft was taken out of service by Company Maintenance. Push back, taxi, takeoff all normal flying out of ZZZ1. There was nothing unusual or abnormal about the landing. It was nice soft landing and the nose wheel was lowered at a normal rate and nothing rough or abrupt about it. Aircraft control was maintained throughout the rollout at ZZZ and remained either on the center line of the runway or the taxiway lines the entire time of the event. Operations and Company Maintenance worked well together to get the plane to the gate and the passengers safely to the terminal.				B737-800 Captain reported Nose Wheel Shimmy during landing roll out accompanied by lack of Nose Wheel Steering. The flight crew requested a tug to move the aircraft to the gate. Maintenance reported the Nose Wheel Scissors Bolt was missing.

I noticed that the stall bar wasn't dropping correctly, and sensing something was wrong looked at the Flap Gauge and discovered the Flaps were showing essentially up (they were split slightly). I believe the Captain noticed the same thing at the same time. Both of us called for a go-around pretty much simultaneously. I performed the go-around, he reported the go-around to Tower, and they gave us runway heading and an initial altitude. After switching to TRACON, the Captain requested priority handling and asked for vectors for a box pattern back to ZZZ XX. The Captain then proceeded through the checklist and ran weight and balance, while I flew the box pattern. On downwind, we switched aircraft control. I reviewed the Non-normal Checklist and weight and balance data. The Captain flew a no flap landing with slats approach. We taxied clear and to the gate without further incident.		On approach and conducting an ILS to Runway XX in ZZZ, the trailing edge flaps did not extend when commanded. It was the First Officer's leg and our flight departed on time out of ZZZ1. We climbed and cruised en route towards ZZZ uneventfully. We began our descent into ZZZ via the EMZOH 3, but the weather would not allow that. ZZZ was experiencing gusty winds out of the south, medium rain and occasional moderate turbulence. They switched us to the ZZZZZ 2 Arrival. Near the end of the arrival, we were vectored, slowed and told to expect an ILS to Runway XX. As we approached the final approach course, we were slowed to 200 KIAS, then 170 KIAS. It was at that time that the PF (Pilot Flying) requested flaps 5. I moved the flap handle and verified the flap handle position, but did not verify that the Trailing Edge Flap Gauge indicated 5 degrees. I was definitely task-loaded with ATC instructions, with the turbulence adding distraction. Immediately after the PF asked for landing gear down, flaps 15 was requested. I moved the landing gear handle down and the flap handle to the flaps 15 position. I verified the flap selector was in the proper detent. At this moment, I noticed both that the MASI footer was far higher than appropriate and that the trailing edge flap gauge indicated split flaps. I immediately called for a go-around. We executed the go-around and given two upwind altitudes (1,600 ft. then 3,000 ft.) ATC queried us as to the reason and I told him that we had a Flight Control malfunction, asked for delay vectors back to Runway XX and to standby. He began vectoring us to the east and north. We ran the QRH Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry Checklist and requested non normal landing data via weight and balance. During this time, I requested priority handling and gave the souls and fuel onboard in that communication. I took control of the aircraft after the flap procedure was complete. We conducted another ILS into ZZZ and landed uneventfully. Once we cleared the runway, the Brake Cooling Module was run and we taxied to the gate. A logbook entry was made and various Company Operations Center Personnel were communicated with. I was on a planned deadhead home (the incident aircraft) and my FO (First Officer) was removed from the trip early and went home. We were both visibly stressed from the incident. Weather and turbulence certainly played a prominent role as an additive condition, generating a change in arrival and extensive delay vectors.		B737-700 flight crew reported Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry during approach. The flight crew executed a go-around and ran the QRH and checklists. The flight crew requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing at destination airport.

We were on the ZZZZZ into ZZZ, on the last leg of a four day trip. Upon checking in with Approach Control, we were told to expect vectors to the ILS XXR with an approximately nine mile final. A lot of things happened in quick succession between the end of our downwind and when the controller broke us off the approach. I don't think my memory of the order of events is exactly right, but it's close, and it's to the best of my recollection. Somewhere prior to ZZZZZ on downwind we were told to maintain present speed (240) and given a descent to 3000 ft. I selected speed 240 and pulled for Open Descent to 3000 ft. Not long after that while still in a descent, passing maybe 5000 ft., we were given speed 210 and told to hustle down to 2000 ft. I clicked off the autopilot to get the full benefit of flight spoilers and we continued descent while slowing. Somewhere below about 3500 ft. approach thanked us for hurrying down and slowed us to 170 kts. I believe there was also a frequency change in here, but I'm not sure. I asked for and received flaps 2 on speed. We were given a base turn, and nearing 2000 ft. the Controller asked us to confirm we were leveling at 2400 ft. I was passing 2200 ft. still hand flying and leveled off while the FO (First Officer) said we were going to 2000 ft. as assigned. I'm now ignoring the flight director pitch command. The Controller said something like, 'Low altitude no wait you look like you're good just stay at 2200' and gave us another turn to final and cleared us for the approach. I start the turn and am now ignoring both pitch and bank commands on the flight director and unsure why the FO hasn't changed the FCU. Unfortunately, the altitude horn was going off because I had leveled at 2200 ft. and the altitude window was still set to 2000 ft. I saw that the FO was confused and frustrated at the source of the horn, but I couldn't turn on the autopilot because I didn't want it to continue down to 2000 ft. and I was in a turn, so I said something like, 'It's an altitude horn, cancel it.' and pointed at the FCU. Not only was I too loaded up with hand flying to explain how to kill the horn and request FCU input, but upon debriefing, I learned that the FO was only partially able to hear what ATC or I was even saying over the horn.The FO canceled the horn, but by that point, I had not rolled out of my turn and was turning away from the final approach course by about 30 degrees AND had descended to about 2080 ft. while distracted, and ATC had asked like eight questions in rapid succession that the FO was too confused to answer. ATC exclaimed we were turning away from the course and said, 'Low altitude alert, I'm gonna break you off' and gave us a climb to 3000 ft. and a turn.  The FO input it into the FCU, and I got the autopilot on ASAP. We cleaned up from flaps 2 to flaps 1, made sure the approach was still loaded in the box, received another downwind-to-base turn and clearance for the ILS XXR, and landed normally.

Normal taxi, We departed Runway XX ZZZ. As TO power applied we began to notice burning oil smell on flight deck. I thought about rejecting but it was not my leg and this is not an uncommon thing and dissipates once engines are at pores for a moment. Continued TO and after rotation fumes continued and seemed to increase. Out of 1500 I told ZZZ Tower Controller we were having a fume event and needed an immediate return. I did not declare emergency since there was no visible smoke. We were handed to ZZZ TRACON Departure, turned at 3000 ft. Downwind for Runway XY. I dinged Cabin and asked if they smelled anything, the response was no. I told them we would be returning to ZZZ and they had 10 minutes, let me know if they see anything. During this time odor continued. Didn't get any better. We accomplished after After TO ck, cruz, descent ck and a quick set up and brief of ILS Runway XY. weather was CAVOK. We were over landing weight and deployed Gear and flaps in downwind to burn fuel. I did a rough and dirty calc and figured we would be at landing weight at touchdown. I sent acars to Dispatch and called gate freq in ZZZ to tell them we would need a gate right away.   FO (First Officer) landed perfectly smooth touch. I noted we had touched at 450# over MAX landing weight.  We taxied to fast to gate. I started APU for electric and shut down the Left engine and the result was increase in fumes. We pulled into gate and shut down RH engine and went on APU air. The fumes subsided and I suspect it was the RH engine dumping oil into the bleed air to the pack. Maintenance arrived and Mechanic said he smelled the oil as he entered the plane. Post flight I spoke with ALL the flight attendants and the rear positions said they had strong fumes. The #1 on call said there were no fumes. Some people simply have bad smell? IDK.  A cursery review of the aircraft past history indicated high oil consumption of the RH engine. I had noted this and it was included in my preflight threat assessment briefing to the FO. I did not declare an emergency as the traffic at the airport was not heavy and my priority was getting on the ground ASAP. It was extremely high workload and I commend the FO for the teamwork. I think we covered the bases and actually had to extend the downwind an extra minute to get finished. The Tower was aware of the situation and I assume an alert 1 was issued. I felt further distraction of declaration was not helpful. I fully blame Company maintenance procedures for not identifying and repairing the high oil consumption on the RH engine. They dispatched an aircraft with an ongoing defect. Jets are not Piston engines and high oil consumption should not be deferred and dispatched.Tricresyl phosphate when burned and introduced into cabin can kill. The Airline has a fume event reporting policy and has taken adequate steps to report the downline event reporting. I feel Maintenance diminishes the serious nature of fumes in the cabin. This aircraft should have not been dispatched with high oil burn.				Air Carrier Captain reported a burning oil odor during takeoff and initial climb which prompted the flight crew to request an immediate return to departure airport. After a safe landing the flight continued to the gate where maintenance met the aircraft.

The increase was so sudden that by the time I turned off the auto throttles and autopilot to manually increase thrust and take control, the aircraft altitude had reached approximately 300 ft. above FL380. To regain airspeed, the recovery required me to descend to approximately 200 ft. below FL380 where I then increased pitch to stabilize the climb back to FL380 while returning to level autoflight. No other moderate to severe turbulence was experienced and the flight continued without further incident.				B737-800 pilot reported encountering sudden moderate to severe turbulence in the climb between FL370 and FL380 that resulted in airspeed and altitude deviations.

Flight XXXX had just passed point ZZZZZ1 on the departure and was cleared by ATC to continue on the SID except to climb and maintain 14,000 ft. During turn to next point ZZZ1 (8000 ft. and below) and at approximately 7000 ft. aircraft became momentarily unstable, rolling 45 degrees (audible Bank angle call), airspeed increased 20 kts., climbed 1700 ft. to 8700 ft. and nose of aircraft pitched to 15 degrees. Pilot flying leveled wings and began lowering nose to gain control and come back down to 8000 ft. (ZZZ1 crossing restriction). Pilot monitoring (PM) noticed the light for the 'OFF SCHEDULE DESCENT' had also illuminated as pilot flying attempted to control speed and rate of descent. Severe Turbulence and aircraft control issues continued until passing 9000 ft. Once aircraft had cleared and stabilized on the climb out, PM reported Severe Turbulence to ATC, conducted the ORH procedure for 'Off Scheduled Descent' Checklist and checked with Crew in back to make sure all Flight Attendants and Passengers were okay. The 'A' Flight Attendant informed PM (Captain) that everyone (Crew and Passengers) was okay with no injuries reported. Some Passengers were visibly shaken and voiced their concerns to the Flight Attendants who professionally assured them the aircraft was safe and stable. Captain also made a PA to the Passengers and apologized for the rough ride. Flight continued to ZZZ2 and landed safely without any further issues.		While operating Flight XXXX and departing ZZZ on the ZZZZZ.5 RNAV SID between ZZZZZ1 and ZZZ1, encountered moderate, occasional severe turbulence, and wind shear. The atmospheric conditions caused erratic airspeed and attitude variation during the climb, causing the aircraft to climb to approximately 8700 ft. Corrective action was taken to bring the aircraft under control and correct the altitude to 8000 ft. prior to crossing ZZZ1.		B737 flight crew reported encountering severe turbulence while climbing on departure that caused a temporary loss of control resulting in a climb above the SID crossing restriction.

Conditions were smooth and expected smooth on the arrival. Passenger seat belt sign was on and Flight Attendants were out of their seats and performing normal duties. The First Officer asked Washington Center what kind of aircraft we were behind on the arrival, and approach informed us it was Aircraft X. We asked to slow down to 250 and felt a little more wake and then asked for vectors off course on the arrival. The First Officer then called the Flight Attendants who were okay but were jolted by the wake turbulence. We increased spacing with Aircraft X and continued to a normal visual approach and landing. The Flight Attendants did not require medical attention. The D position was done with her trip and went home. The A, B, and C were going to continue flying another flight. Two of the Flight Attendants, I think the B and C, mentioned their backs hurt but that they could keep flying and would be okay. No passengers were injured.

While investigating on the FMS the reason for the discrepancy, we got a GPS fail message. I was off the radio number 1 for communication to ZZZZZ2 of my 'movement message.' When I got back and saw the problem, I tried to update the GPS position with the help from VOR DME near to me. It took too long because ATC issued a heading change to correct the route deviation.Not sure if there was an GPS outage or was a momentary glitch but we didn't have any further problem after that. I wrote up the discrepancy in the logbook for Maintenance to check. We both checked the route on the ground and all the points were in the FMS. If I can make change to my procedure, I will delay my movement message to the company until after level-off at final cruising altitude, to be more present during the climbing phase of the flight.		Upon crossing ZZZZZ enroute to ZZZZZ1, I noticed the filed course and aircraft location did not coincide on my iPad's GPS. I rechecked our FMS routing and the Captain announced a GPS fail message. He attempted to update the GPS position with the closest VOR DME, during which ATC issued an immediate heading change to avoid military airspace.The cause of the initial issue is not immediately apparent as there was a momentary GPS fail/potential FMS glitch but no further navigational issues for the remainder of the flight. The response time to notice and correct the GPS discrepancy/routing resulted in the course deviation. We immediately complied to ATC instructions on heading, updated positioning, reloaded assigned route, and returned on course. The Captain wrote up the GPS fail and RNP increase in the maintenance logbook. He discussed the issue with the maintainers on the ground. Prior to the flight, both pilot flying (me) and pilot monitoring (the Captain) listened to the clearance, reviewed the route prior to execution within the FMS, and sequenced through the legs page during the takeoff/STAR brief. We will continue to follow this procedure but in addition maintain higher amount of situational awareness of the points during entire climb/STAR, delay non-critical communication, and notify ATC immediately of any navigational errors and/or course deviations prior to correction attempts.		B737-800 flight crew reported a course deviation due to a temporary loss of GPS service.

Within a second or two the airplane called out 'ROLL AUTHORITY, ROLL AUTHORITY '. I turned off the autopilot, rolled wings level, and had the First Officer request lateral offset. ATC gave us a climb. The roll was gentle in nature and as soon as the AP was turned off and wings were level the event concluded. Time from start to finish maybe 6 seconds and was no more than a light bumps as far as turbulence is concerned. When I queried the flight attendants later only one had noticed.	Reporter stated he found it unusual to encounter wake at cruise altitude.	At a cruise altitude FL360 the flight crew noticed some bumps followed by a strong roll to the left side of the aircraft. We received two 'Roll Authority' audible warnings from the aircraft resulting in the Captain disconnecting the autopilot and returning the aircraft to straight and level flight. The Captain then re-engaged the autopilot. We then looked at our TCAS system and noticed we were in trail of another aircraft. We Inquired ATC and asked what kind of aircraft. They said it was a narrow body Airbus. As we were in calm conditions we assumed we had flown through the aircraft's wake. We requested a higher altitude and were given FL380.

He informed me that the Stabilizer Trim had failed on his side also, so I proceeded to the QRH and after reviewing the index I ran the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative procedure. Also, at this point the Controller was directing us to proceed to a fix on the departure SID and I told him that I thought we should [request priority handling] and get a vector towards the airport since I didn't want to get too far away from ZZZ airport with a possible flight control issue. The Captain flew the aircraft to landing and I handled all the administrative tasks. I was quite busy. He asked me to load the ILS approach for XXC which I did and then I sent an ACARS message informing the Company we were returning to the airport for landing due to a flight control issue. I spoke with the Flight Attendants and informed them that we were making a precautionary landing in 10 minutes and to prepare for that and that we expected an uneventful landing. At this point there was some confusion on my part because the Captain asked me to check the box and extend for Runway XXR and I hesitated because I wasn't aware the runway had changed. After I questioned him about it, he cleared the matter up and I loaded and extended off the appropriate navigation fix. At this point, we were on final and I had several more tasks to perform and we both decided the proper order would be based on the Aviate, Navigate, Communicate model. So, I deferred making the PA and ran the before landing flow and on recall the Speed Trim Light annunciated. I quickly ran that checklist for that procedure and then completed the before landing checklist. Next, I made a quick PA to the Passengers and then I got our landing clearance and backed-up the Captain as Monitoring Pilot.The causal factor was all mechanical and we reacted to the given situation. However, I felt as though the recent changes to our procedures added a little bit of uncertainty affecting the ingrained habit patterns that I'd developed over numerous years flying the 737. In my opinion this allowed me to go from normal workload to becoming overloaded quicker than if I was better trained on the new procedures at the flight training center. I spent a lot of my off time reviewing the new procedures so I could perform them as the procedures presented them but felt that formal training for such a big change would've been ideal and more proper.I completed all the tasks and checklists required but did get to a point where I was task saturated running all the checklists, procedures and cabin communications. My opinion is that the recent change to the procedures without formal training allowed me to go from a normal workload to becoming overloaded much faster than I would have. Also, I noticed that I ran an additional checklist that wasn't necessary; I ran the Speed Trim Fail checklist that annunciated as I did a Recall as we turned final. The Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist Additional Information section states: that after the Stab Trim cutout switches are placed in CUTOUT, the SPEED TRIM FAIL light may illuminate. I believe I was [becoming overloaded] at the point I saw the annunciation of the SPEED TRIM FAIL light so I ran that procedure unnecessarily adding to my workload.				B737 First Officer reported Main Stabilizer Trim Fail on climb. Flight crew performed an air turn back and made a precautionary landing at departure airport.

After requesting priority handling, we followed the CABIN ALTITUDE procedure and deployed the O2 to the Passengers. I believe I asked for a descent to the lowest safe altitude and were cleared to 12,000 ft. We were not far from ZZZZ so I knew we would not be held above 10,000 ft. for very long due to the mountains in the area. I asked the FB (First Officer B) to run a non-normal overweight landing assessment.As I was completing the overweight landing checklist, the checklist indicated we needed to do a flaps 25 landing. However, the landing assessment indicated we needed to do a flaps 20 landing. This is where the confusion for me and the FO started....Both of us firmly believed that all overweight landings were done at flaps 20 yet the checklist indicated flaps 25.... Our belief was supported by the landing assessment completed by the FB from the 'non-normal' section of the landing app as I had instructed him to do.Not having any resolution with the conflicting information, I decided to complete the approach using flaps 20 since it provided a better margin of safety if a go around would have been necessary with one or two engines operating. This airport has terrain in proximity and the runway in use has an 'Engine failure Procedure' missed approach. Considering all of this, I was satisfied to continue the approach and landing at flaps 20...We held over the airport for a couple turns to complete our checklists then commenced our approach to XXR. 		Once we cleared the runway, we stopped on the inner taxiway so the Fire Chief could give us his report. Our Company Mechanic was the liaison to communicate with the Fire Chief...He used turbo fans to cool the gear then offered to hose off the landing gear with water. I did not know if water was appropriate with the gear as hot as it was so I asked Local Maintenance and Maintenance in ZZZ through the Sat-phone if I should give the Fire Chief the go-ahead. 	They offered no guidance. So I agreed with the Chief and they commenced with watering the hot landing gear down.I asked the FB to refer to the Brake Cooling chart in the QRH to get a time for cooling which was about 85 minutes. While we sat there five tires flattened out.Coordination with our Maintenance, Operations and Dispatch in ZZZ all worked well to see to our needs. Air stairs were provided along with busses to transport everyone to the terminal. I held everyone on the plane until the gear temperatures were in a safe range... Some of the difficulties with this event included communications with the Controller I was talking to initially at the start of the event. Her English was fine but the quality of her radio was horrible. I remember asking her a half a dozen times to repeat her clearance because we couldn't understand her. Day 0. XA15 ZAfter I submitted this report, the review page had errors.. The nose number should be Aircraft X. I don't know the tail number offhand.. The aircraft type is 777-300.Day 0 0XA21 ZThe date of the event... in Zulu time was Day 0.With regard to the pressurization issue, Maintenance will make the determination as to why it happened. I flew this aircraft a week earlier. When I showed up to the aircraft to begin that sequence, the cockpit was filled with Mechanics trying to clear three status messages. I believe they were for both Outflow Valves and one for Cabin Altitude. Regarding the procedures for the overweight landing... Having time to review the events, the biggest distraction for my decision making was my preconceived notion that flaps 20 is the setting for an overweight landing. My First Officer (FO) had the same perspective. Now having reviewed the procedure, I see that the flaps 20 landing is tied to a single engine landing and not a two engine landing. During our annual training we go through this exercise and it is always tied to an engine failure. I think this is why my convection for insisting on using flaps 20 was so strong. Adding to that, I asked the FB for a non-normal landing assessment which is the, Flaps 20 landing (overweight, etc.) failure.... Located in the non-normal category in the landing app. This also supported my decision for a flaps 20 landing...It is obvious now that it was the wrong place to go for that information. Using the Normal landing assessment for this abnormal situation was the place to go. Reviewing all of this in the aftermath of this event, it is obvious that flaps 25 was the appropriate flap setting.Some of the abnormal procedures as they are written are difficult to understand. In the heat of the moment, there were a couple of decision questions that I couldn't understand. Now after a careful review, I have a better understanding of this procedure but in the heat of the moment it was very confusing. Suggestions:Complete understanding of the checklist procedures.		This was a night takeoff out of ZZZZ and I was the FB (First Officer B) on this flight. Going into this flight we were advised that we needed to do an inflight check on the PACKs. The Captain talked to Dispatch to verify what we needed to do to accomplish the checks. The Captain mentioned that we needed to wait to chime the Flight Attendants (FAs) at 15,000 ft. due to mountainous terrain before they were let up to begin service. After the chime was made the First Officer (FO) noticed the Cabin Altitude was not scheduling appropriately, I think it was approximately around 9,200 ft. We all confirmed this was the case, we were still climbing along with the Cabin Altitude. When we hit 10,000 ft. on the Cabin Altitude we received the CABIN ALTITUDE Warning. The Alert was acknowledged, at that point I stated that we needed to get our oxygen mask on, which we all did. The Captain assigned the FO flying duties (the FO was already the pilot flying) and the Captain pulled out the QRC and started the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist from the card. We were still in the climb and needed to level off. The Captain asked if we all agreed if we were in an urgent situation and we did. The Captain [requested priority handling] and let ATC know that we needed to return to ZZZZ and level off and descend back down. We ultimately leveled off at FL210 but took some time to get back down below 9,000 ft. During this time the Captain had pushed the PASS OXYGEN switch since the Cabin Pressurization continued to climb (I think it topped out at approximately 12,600 ft.). During this time the Captain had me call the #1 FA and advise them that we lost our Cabin Pressurization and will be coming back to ZZZZ and doing a Precautionary Landing and to expect the fire trucks to be around. We would call them back with more information once we had time. We worked with ATC to get us to a minimum safe altitude and set up for a hold so we can run through the checklist. The captain asked me to run the landing distance for our weight which was approximately 638,000 pounds and an overweight landing. I proceeded to use the normal landing distance portion of the app and gave the weights the landing distance for the different brake configurations 3 through auto max, with a 5 - wet/good braking action and flaps 25 and a Pressure Altitude of 3,000 ft. After giving this information the Captain advised we needed to use Flaps 20 and I believe I said that is not an option and I was then directed to use the non-normal portion of the landing app. I pulled the information for FLAPS 20 Landing (overweight) and provided the landing distance with the before mentioned parameters. Going through the overweight landing checklist we all agreed that it would be a VREF 30 + additives (wind and gusts, 5 knots minimum) is above 170 kts. At that point VREF 25 was selected but still planned to use FLAPS 20 for landing. When doing the landing checklist, I mentioned that we will not be able to complete the checklist (unless we were to override, which I did not say) if we had VREF 25 and flaps set at 20. Since the plan was to land Flaps 20 it was then set to VREF 20. The FO made a nice landing using FLAPS 20 and auto max brakes and rolled out, while passing controls to the Captain around 60 kts, all the way to Taxiway X, which was 10,685 ft. down the runway.We started our taxi back to the gate and noticed our brake temps were hot. At this point the Captain stopped the aircraft, we talked to Ground and let them know we could not move, and the parking brake was not set. The Captain had us reference the QRH for the Recommended Brake Cooling Schedule and it appeared it would take approximately 85 minutes to cool. During this time the Fire Chief was already present, and they had checked our brakes, which were indeed hot. At this point the Fire Chief determined that they needed to cool the brakes with water and the team started to cool all the brakes with water. Eventually they were able to hook up a tow to ouraircraft and chock the wheels, so the captain and FO were no longer having to hold the brakes manually. Ultimately five of the tires' plugs opened to release the pressure in the tires. Since we were not able to taxi the Captain worked with Dispatch, since it was a little bit of a challenge due to the language differences, to get stairs, a lift for the wheelchairs, and busses so the Passengers can get off the aircraft and back to the terminal.Two more things to add about the Flight Attendants, they did a really good job of waiting for us to provide them with information vice calling us while we were in flight. Also, the Captain did a nice job trying to slow everything down, assign task, and keep all players in the loop.Cause: The loss of cabin altitude.Deciding to use flaps 20 and the use of the non-normal landing app and using flaps 20 overweight landing, vice just using the normal landing app and selecting flaps 25 or 30 if that is what is called for.Would help to have and overweight landing on the non-normal side of the landing app. Overweight landing is a non-normal and does place us in an emergency situation. It could give you the same answer as the normal side of the landing app, but maybe not cause any confusion. I now remember in training they had us pull up the non-normal side and note that there was not an overweight option on the landing app.Suggestions: If the cabin altitude were to hold and schedule correctly that would help. Maybe add overweight landing to the non-normal side of the landing app too.		Flight Crew reported loss of Cabin Pressure Control in climb. The Cabin Altitude climbed above 12,500 ft. and the O2 masks were deployed. The Flight Crew requested priority handling and immediately descended. The Flight Crew preformed an air turn back and made an overweight landing at departure airport.

The system would not show information pertaining to the time or predictive details of the flight. The Captain was the pilot monitoring in this case, so the Captain gave me both the flight controls and the radios. The Captain proceeded to do both the short and long resets of the FMGC 1. The reset of FMGC 1 was unsuccessful. The FMGC seemed to reset itself several times in flight and almost come back to functioning as normal, but eventually stayed in the partially failed condition. The Captain then wrote up the FMGC and sent a message to Maintenance about its condition. While reviewing the procedure we revived an IR (Inertial Reference) 3 position error message on the FMGC 1. Then we determined that the IR position was drifting a bit but was within acceptable limits. Shortly afterward we received a similar error about IR 2. We made the same determination about this system that it was within limits. We talked about possible issues with navigation and how we would handle it if they arose. We continued to watch the systems and brief the approach into ZZZ for [Runway] XXR. We determined that we would only use AP2 (Autopilot) on the approach and that we would continue to watch the systems for any other errors. No other errors seemed to appear on the descent and the first half of the approach. As we reached approximately 500 ft. on the approach, I disconnected the AP and started to hand-fly the aircraft. At this time the Captain noted that the speed bug had vanished. I continued to fly and noticed that the speed was beginning to drop off. I then noticed that the GS was beginning to show that we were low. I pitched the nose up to correct but the speed continued to drop. At that moment the GS warning came on, the Captain said to kick off the AT (Autothrottles), and I disconnected the AT and added power. After the descent was stabilized, I reestablished visually on the PAPI and landed the aircraft without further incident. Upon touchdown and rollout, the TERRAIN TERRAIN PULL UP EGPWS went off. Unsure what had caused this at the moment, I attributed it to the issue with the FMGC and we continued with the landing. After we landed, we were confused as to what happened, but decided to investigate it when we got to the gate. After parking at the gate and shutting down the aircraft, we went back over the events of the flight in an effort to determine what had happened. We then re-read the FMGC failure procedure and noted that the last page had a note that the AT would not work once the AP was turned off. We took a moment to think about how we could have missed this, noting that several other messages had popped up during the procedure, and the system had come back and failed several times during the flight. We made sure the FMGC was noted in the logbook and informed Maintenance before departing the plane.The fact that there had been several issues that popped up during the flight led to checklists and procedures to become interrupted. In the future I will be sure to get out my QRH and look at the procedure also, if the situation allows for it. The procedure was a very long one. It is very easy to become distracted by multiple situations accumulating. If I am ever in a similar situation, while in cruise flight where the task saturation is lowered, I will also get out my QRH and follow along with what is happening.		While in cruise flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ, FMGC 1 had a partial failure. The system would not show information pertaining to the time or predictive details of the flight. I was the pilot monitoring in this case, so I assigned the FO (First Officer) to work both the flight controls and the radios. I reviewed the "Single Latch with AP (Autopilot) and FD Still Available in Managed Modes on Both Sides" QRH XX - XX but in the process the FMGC 1 came back online, although temporary. It then failed again and I proceeded to do both the short and long resets of the FMGC 1. The reset of FMGC 1 was unsuccessful. The FMGC seemed to reset itself several times in flight, and almost come back to functioning as normal, but eventually stayed in the partially failed condition. I then wrote up the FMGC and sent a message to Maintenance about its condition. While reviewing the procedure we received an IR (Inertial Reference) 3 position error message on the FMGC 1. We determined that the IR position was drifting but was within acceptable limits. Shortly after, we received a similar error about IR 2. We made the same determination about this system that it was within limits. We backed up all navigation conventionally using manually tuned VORs and advised ATC that if we were off course, to advise us.We talked about possible issues with navigation and how we would handle it if they arose. We continued to watch the systems and brief the approach into ZZZ for [Runway] XXR. We determined that we would only use AP2 on the approach and that we would continue to watch the systems for any other errors. No other errors seemed to appear on the descent and the first half of the approach. As we reached approximately 500 ft. on the approach, the FO disconnected the AP and started to hand-fly the aircraft. At this time I noted that my speed bug had vanished. The airspeed was decreasing and the FO was getting low on the glideslope. The AT (Autothrottles) were not being responsive so I asked the FO to disconnect the autothrust and add power. The descent was stabilized and the FO landed normally and on speed without AT. After we landed, we were confused as to what happened, but decided to investigate it when we got to the gate. After parking at the gate and shutting down the aircraft, we went back over the events of the flight in an effort to determine what had happened.We then re-read the FMGC failure procedure and noted that the last page had a note that the AT would not work once the AP was turned off. We took a moment to think about how we could have missed this, noting that several other messages had popped up during the procedure, and the system had come back and failed several times during the flight. We made sure the FMGC was noted in the logbook and informed Maintenance before departing the plane. FMGC failures do not occur often and [I] have never been trained of this particular event in the simulator. When the FMGC acted normally, albeit briefly, I suspect I stopped reviewing the entire procedure.		A320 flight crew reported a FMGC 1 malfunction in flight that also affected the IR. The flight crew followed the FMGC failure procedure, which led to the autothrottles being unavailable during the landing.

At rotation, I lost all Flight Guidance in the HUD and attempted to transition to my PFD. I lost all vertical and lateral guidance, Flight Director, Flight Path Vector, Magnetic Compass, Heading Bug, and Terrain on my PFD and ND. The Check Airman gave excellent assistance to make the quick turn on the RNAV SID. I got the aircraft leveled off around 12,000 ft. over the water and that's when we realized he had everything working - I transferred the aircraft to him and started diagnosing the problems. We noticed TCAS and XPONDER FAIL messages at this time. No Amber Lights were Illuminated. We attempted a Recall and nothing posted. I checked our PERF INIT page and realized the L IRS (Inertial Reference System) was blank and ran the checklist. IRS on R restored all my data until the approach in ZZZ. We continued our flight to FL300. Over ZZZ1, in RVSM airspace, we found a reference in the Flight Manual that required 2 IRSs. I requested a descent to FL280. I looked at all the IRS checklists and none had a note to exit RVSM airspace. We talked about it for about an hour and half before finding the FOM reference for RVSM. The checklist should include a note to exit RVSM or request relief from ATC. Can we add notes to checklists to exit RVSM or request relief if the failed system is required for RVSM?		During cruise in RVSM at FL 300, we descended to FL280 due to a loss of 1 Primary Altitude Measurement System. During flight we had a loss of the L IRS which lead to a loss of a Primary Altitude Measurement System.		B737-800 flight crew reported loss of HUD guidance in flight due to failure of Inertial Reference Unit #1. Flight crew continued the flight to destination airport without descending out of RVSM airspace as required by the flight manual.

Just after the 1,000 ft.  callout - set speed, Flaps 1, climb thrust - we flew into a large flock of geese. We immediately knew we hit some based on aircraft and engine vibration and a strong odor. The Captain, pilot monitoring, notified Tower and we received an amended clearance to level off at 3,000 ft. MSL and a vector off the SID. After transferring controls, due to suspected aircraft damage, requested radar vectors back to the airport. After loading the approach and receiving landing data, we were cleared for a visual approach back at ZZZ and landed without incident. Once at the gate, we observed fan blade damage to the #1 engine and a hole, approximately 12-in. x 4-in., in the right leading edge flap. There was also evidence of a bird strike on both the left and right outboard leading edges, for a total of at least four impacts.		Multiple bird strikes during takeoff. Noticed odor in the cabin and vibration from number one engine. Advised Departure Control we were returning to ZZZ. Informed Operations, flight attendants and passengers about bird strike and the return to ZZZ.		B737-800 flight crew reported multiple bird strikes during takeoff.

Aircraft X engine out, divert to ZZZ2. Took off from ZZZ at XA:15. Flew 404 miles west at FL380. Approximately 1 hour 20 minutes into flight, directly over ZZZ2, we noticed left throttle coming up at same time we received an EICAS message ENG FAIL R. We ran the drift down checklist and got clearance to FL200, max altitude was FL220. With ZZZ Center, started descent using VNAV. When it was obvious we were going to be landing at either ZZZ3 or ZZZ2, I advised my FO (First Officer) to come out of VNAV and use the speed brake to hasten our descent.The FO and I had conversation regarding ZZZ2 versus ZZZ3. FO pointed out that ZZZ2 was closer and fulfilled criteria as alternate airport - plus, weather was excellent, and a 12,000 ft. runway. FO coordinated with ATC for ZZZ2 and changed destination in FMC. FO was flying the aircraft and handling ATC, I ran the engine failure checklist and got to point where we had to analyze engine. We both saw no N2 rotation. I made call to Dispatch and got Maintenance Control on the line.Maintenance Control ran through what we had and I wanted confirmation that we were not to restart as zero N2. Maintenance Control thought that with oil quantity normal we should have a restart attempt. We ran restart checklist as embedded in the ENG FAIL R checklist but after 3 minutes, still no restart so I made decision to complete shut down and make a southeast Flaps 20 landing into ZZZ2.At this point we briefed the ILS XX approach into ZZZ2 and I made a PA to the passengers and a briefing to the FAs (Flight Attendant). I decided to land the aircraft as FO was still less than 100 hours, plus on probation. We transferred the controls, ran the descent checklist, and was then vectored for a southeast ILS to [Runway] XX. We landed at approximately XB:48. Approach and landing were normal and we taxied to Gate XX followed by Crash Rescue, who confirmed no FOD or debris from our aircraft. We parked at Gate XX and managed to get a jetway close enough to deplane the aircraft. ZZZ2 staff were excellent in handling the unusual situation and air carrier X was able to find another 777 to bring from ZZZ4 to ZZZ2 to get passengers to ZZZ1.		Took off from ZZZ at XA:15. Flew 404 miles west at FL380, approximately 1 hour 20 minutes into flight directly over ZZZ2, we noticed left throttle coming up at same time we received an EICAS message ENG FAIL R.

I coordinated with ATC for ZZZ2 and changed destination in FMC. I was flying the aircraft and handling ATC, Captain ran the engine failure checklist and got to point where we had to analyze the engine. We both saw no N2 rotation.

I performed the check and also noticed the stiffness, but there was no restriction or problem with movement. We discussed our options and I decided since there was no binding or restricted movement, we should be good to continue. On departure at 800 ft. AGL, the FO performed the thrust cutback as per the noise abatement procedure. When I went to lower the pitch, the yoke felt stuck. It took an unusual amount of force to free the yoke and lower the nose. We leveled off at 13,000 ft. and ran the Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls QRH. Upon completion of the QRH, we decided it was best to divert to ZZZ1. I coordinated with Dispatch and told him our problem and the plan to divert to ZZZ1, and he agreed that was the best course of action. The FO coordinated our divert with Approach. We did not [request priority handling] as the aircraft was flying normally. I briefed the Flight Attendants and Passengers and called ZZZ1 Station Operations to ensure they were in the loop. The FO calculated the landing data and we realized we would have to make an overweight landing, as we weighed 133,500 pounds. He referenced the overweight landing section in the manual and we decided to land on XXR at ZZZ1 since it was the longest runway. We looked at brake cooling but it was not a factor. We configured normally, landed and taxied to the gate without incident. All in all, this was a fairly straightforward diversion, but after pulling into the gate, coordinating with Maintenance, Dispatch, Company Operations Chief Pilot, and Crew Scheduling, and making the appropriate write-ups, I found myself drained. I was very grateful we did not have to continue with our flying and instead got to deadhead home.		On takeoff, as the Captain lowered the nose to accelerate, he experienced a very brief 'hanging up' in the elevator controls. It was easily overpowered and the decision to make a precautionary overweight landing in ZZZ1 was made. During the previous landing I noticed a very slight roughness in the elevator during flare, but it was not a feeling that was out of the ordinary enough to cause concern of a potential malfunction. During the Flight Control Check, there was a slight roughness in the elevator, but again it didn't seem anything more than what would be experienced during normal operations. It was very subtle and noted by both of us as being within normal limits from past experience. I noticed the 'hang up' that the Captain experienced on takeoff and it had amplified enough to cause us both concern and initiate a divert.		B737 flight crew reported after takeoff the elevator control system felt stiff. The pilots elected to divert to a nearby airport for maintenance action. An overweight landing was successfully accomplished.

After coasting out we received a NAV Unable RNP. It climbed to 4.04 and held there. We contacted ATC (ZZZZ) as well as Dispatch to advise. We called the [Relief Pilots] up to the cockpit to work the problem with us. Upon crossing ZZZ the ANP went up to 6.02. We once again advised ATC (ZZZZ1) on HF as well as Dispatch. It stayed the same until we hit land when it again climbed to around 14.5-15ish. We had a normal departure out of ZZZZ5. Over ZZZZ3 our GPS starting being jammed with some frequency. This was an ongoing problem and lasted almost all the way across ZZZZ4. Once we were over ZZZZ and no longer being jammed everything went back to normal. I don't have a suggestion as to how to stop the bad actors from jamming our GPS. I will suggest however that flight crews be aware it can last a lot longer than 12 minutes which is the latest information I had seen prior to this flight.				B777-300 First Officer reported GPS Jamming in foreign airspace.

We departed XXL, with instructions to turn left to a heading of 260. Aircraft X had been cleared to take-off from XXR just prior to our take-off clearance, with instructions to turn right to 020. As we were beginning our left turn, I noticed that the right window was filled with an aircraft. Almost immediately the 'DESCEND NOW' command came into my headset, along with the warning box. The aural alert sounded at least twice, and my immediate thought was that a command to descend when I was only at 450-500 AGL was unusual, to say the least. However, I pushed the nose down firmly but not aggressively to silence the warning. Our total descent/altitude loss was probably in the range of 50-100 ft. When we were clear of the conflict, we continued our climb, and the First Officer (FO), as pilot monitoring, reported the RA to the Tower. Aircraft Y also reported an RA to the Tower. I have no idea what might have triggered this. The winds were gusty, but only 2 degrees off the center line of the runway. But I have never had a 'DESCEND NOW' command so close to the ground. Likewise, I don't ever recall seeing another aircraft that close on a departure from ZZZ. It's not uncommon in ZZZ1, but very unusual in ZZZ.				B737 Captain reported a NMAC with another B737 on initial climb after take-off.

This was an originating flight. I performed a pre-flight inspection and did not see any abnormalities. We pushed back normally and taxied out on Engine #2 to Runway XL for departure. On taxi out, we started the #1 engine. Start occurred normally. Three to five minutes later, we were cleared into position on Runway XL. We took the runway. Tower cleared us for take-off. The Captain set the thrust to 40% N1, and then applied normal take-off power. Immediately we heard Tower key up the mic and told us to abort the take-off. A (other carrier) aircraft had apparently observed a 10 ft. flame out the back of the #1 engine, and the Tower informed us of this immediately. The Captain called the abort, closed the thrust levers, extended the speed brakes, applied the brakes, and deployed reverse thrust.I made the appropriate call outs. We had not yet achieved 80 kts, as I had not made the 80-kt. call. We stopped the aircraft just prior to the taxiway. Tower called for Crash Fire and Rescue trucks to be rolled. The Captain made the appropriate 'Remain Seated' call over the PA, and then quickly contacted the Flight Attendants to inform them of the rejected takeoff, asked if they saw any smoke or flames in the #1 engine, and to remain seated and standby. We had no indication of fire from flight deck indications. Correctly, in my estimation, the Captain then called for the Tail Pipe Fire QRH. We ran the Checklist methodically, shutting down the engine and proceeded with motoring it per the QRH. By this time, Crash Fire and Rescue had reached the aircraft.We made contact with (CFR) Crash Fire Rescue and they determined that there was no active fire or smoke coming from the #1 Engine. We ran the brake cooling performance data module and determined that our brake energy was low enough to indicate parking at the gate was safe, should we decide to continue back to the gate. We communicated with CFR that we would like an escort back to the terminal. We informed Station Operations that we had a rejected takeoff and a tailpipe fire and that we needed to return to the gate. The Captain communicated with the Flight Attendants and the passengers that we were instructed by Tower to make a rejected takeoff, and that we needed to return to the gate for maintenance. We then started the APU, performed the after landing flow, and taxied back to the gate under the Supervision of CFR.Upon arrival at gate, CFR inspected the #1 engine and found no indication of smoke or fire. We deplaned the aircraft normally through the main cabin door. We then had a face-to-face meeting with the Fire Chief to discuss their response to the situation and both sides agreed that CFR handled the situation with speed, good communication, and an emphasis on safety. They are to be commended. I was personally impressed by both the timeliness of their response, and their willingness to seek feedback after the event. Kudos to the Captain for calling for the proper checklists and bringing the aircraft to a stop safely, early in the takeoff. Also, commendations to the Flight Attendants for keeping the cabin calm, while we handled things on the flight deck. Maintenance arrived and we discussed the event, putting the write up for the #1 engine as a reported tailpipe fire. I am satisfied that we handled the matter in accordance with the training I have received as a Company First Officer.		Number 1 Engine had tailpipe fire on takeoff. Other Air Carrier saw 10 ft. flames coming from the #1 Engine during takeoff roll and reported to Tower. ATC then requested us to reject the takeoff. Reject occurred at 75 kts. We then proceeded with the Engine Tailpipe Fire Checklist. Fire trucks rolled and inspected for fire. Fire was gone prior to fire trucks arrival. Proceeded to gate after running Brake Cooling procedures.		B737-700 flight crew reported a rejected takeoff when observers informed them of fire coming from the #1 Engine. The flight crew exited the active runway and called for CFR. After inspecting the aircraft, CFR escorted the aircraft back to the gate.

I was the pilot flying, so I told Person A that I had the radios and asked them to run the associated Non-normal Checklist. I was not familiar with this malfunction, but it became immediately clear that there was a possibility that we may have to shut down the engine. I asked Person A to hold on for a second and I transmitted to ATC that we wanted to level off at FL190 in order to work a possible engine problem and that I would get back to them with more information shortly, which was approved as requested. Realizing the possible severity of the situation and the possibility of some very challenging checklists ahead, I decided to swap roles and have Person A fly and run the comms, while I ran the associated checklists for the problem. I started the checklist, which called for turning off the autothrottle and retarding the engine until either the message goes out or it is at idle. I coordinated this with Person A so that they could smoothly apply the needed rudder to compensate for the loss of thrust, which went very smoothly all the way to idle with the message still illuminated. I then knew we were going to shut down the engine, so I took the radios back and with ATC, told them we were returning to ZZZ and needed a turn back toward the airport, and would like to enter a holding pattern in order to run the checklists, and that I would get back to them shortly with the rest of their required information. I then sent a CALL ME message to Dispatch and, while I awaited their reply, I called the Purser and asked them to get out their device because I needed to give them the briefing. They got out the device and I told them that we had to shut down an engine, we are not planning an evacuation, there are no special instructions, we would be returning to ZZZ and landing in about 15 minutes, and that I would make an announcement to the passengers soon.I then called Dispatch on the frequency I was sent, but the transmission was broken and unreadable, so I sent a DIVERT message with a quick note about shutting down an engine and returning to ZZZ. I then went to the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist and secured the engine accordingly, turned on the APU for power, and called ATC back with fuel and souls onboard and asked them for a lower altitude. They gave us 12,000 ft., which caused us to have to use engine anti-ice during the descent, which I selected on for the operational engine. During this time they were vectoring us in an extended holding type pattern. I decided this was a good time to brief the passengers. In a calm voice, I told them that we had to shut down one of our engines, we would be returning to ZZZ, please follow all instructions from the flight attendants, and that I would talk to them on the ground shortly.I then continued to the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist down to the items including the Non-normal Configuration Landing Distance table for our aircraft. We were well below max landing weight for the 900ER. At this point, I checked in with Person A to make sure they were ok and on board with everything that we had done up to that point, which they were. I decided to quickly type a more detailed message to Dispatch stating that we had in fact shut down the Left Engine and would be landing in ZZZ soon, to which they replied that everyone had been advised and that we should return to Gate XXX.I then got landing data for [Runway] XYR, loaded and briefed the ILS including the complex procedure for that runway, adjusted the target speed on the FMS approach page, and since we were in heading mode on vectors, I extended the runway centerline off of ZZZZZ1 with a 284 inbound course. I asked Person A if they wanted to also brief the approach because they were going to be flying it, but they were satisfied with everything I had set up for the approach. I then asked for lower so that we could run the Deferred Items Checklist. When we got below 10,000 ft., I configured the bleed panel, reviewed the flaps 1 go-around with the procedure, and told ATC we were ready for the approach. We were given a vector to intercept the XYR localizer, and since were over 25 miles from the airport, I told Person A that we would need to use LNAV until we were closer in for a better localizer signal. As we rolled wings level, I went to select LNAV but realized the FMS had re-sequenced and the final course was off of the FAF and the magenta line was not far enough out for us to intercept. As I was correcting this problem, we got a TA for an aircraft below us. My immediate concern was that we may have overshot the final approach course, so I told Person A to initiate a right turn and spun the heading bug about 15 degrees right. It turned out that we had not overshot the final and the traffic was just someone climbing out below us and leveling 1,000 ft. below our altitude. I finished extending the centerline off of ZZZZZ1 and rejoined the final. At around 15 miles out we selected approach mode and started configuring for landing. Reaching flaps 15, I ran the Landing Checklist and we proceeded to land uneventfully and taxied to the gate. I thanked the passengers for their understanding and cooperation, then called Dispatch and the Chief Pilot.				B737 Captain reported an Oil Filter Bypass Light caution message appeared while climbing that required an engine shutdown as part of the checklists. The flight crew then performed an air turnback.

Climbing through FL360, we received a Forward and Aft Cargo Smoke Detection Fault. We reviewed the QRC and QRH. We completed QRH XX but it was only for the Forward or Aft and not Both Cargo Compartments, and I wasn't sure but I also thought I smelled something burning. I called, Dispatch and Maintenance (via SATCOM) for some guidance. Maintenance lead me to XY, a different QRH checklist which directed us to land ASAP, and Dispatch told us to return to ZZZZ.In the heat of the moment I was wrapped around my return to ZZZZ that the remaining checklist was not completed, I believe that Maintenance misunderstood my situation and that was not the right checklist to begin with.We notified ATC and [requested priority handling] immediately. The crew was given a briefing code which later changed to lower code just prior to the final approach. After landing safely in ZZZZ, Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) conducted an inspection of the aircraft prior to taxiing and additional inspections of the cargo compartments and interior of the aircraft after parking, and no issues were found.Forward and Aft Cargo Compartment Smoke Detection fault climbing through FL360 was put into the aircraft logbook.				A320 Captain reported Forward and Aft Cargo Compartment Smoke Detection Faults climbing through FL360. The flight crew ran the QRH and check lists. Priority handling was requested and the flight crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

While allowed per MEL, I do not like to fly over water on one pack, especially at night, and even more so when it's the first flight on a single pack. So I contacted Operations Control via Dispatch to ask for a different aircraft. Operations Control said none were available. I also emailed the Duty Chief Pilot for assistance but they never got back to me before departure time. I considered refusing the aircraft, but the FO (First Officer) and I chose not to. We planned to monitor the pressurization system more closely, knowing it was degraded. We boarded and departed on time. Initial climb-out was uneventful. Passing 10,000 ft., we took a close look at the pressurization parameters and all looked normal. We continued to climb to FL290. We were busy in the climb conducting the numerous procedures required for Class II operations. After a few minutes at FL290 we were cleared to climb to FL330.As we initiated the climb, the Lower ECAM switched to the PRESS page and displayed the Cabin Altitude Advisory, flashing at 8,800 ft. and climbing. I pushed the V/S knob to level off at approximately FL294. It appeared that with Pack 1 OFF per MEL, our one remaining pack was 'weak' and not able to fully pressurize the aircraft. We noted the outflow valve was closed. No ECAM cautions or warnings were present.Since the cabin altitude continued to climb even while level at FL294, I directed the FO to request an immediate descent to 10,000 ft. ZZZ Center cleared us right away to descend and maintain 10,000 ft. I selected 10,000 ft. in the FCU (Fuel Control Unit) and began an open descent. At this point the cabin altitude indicated above 9,550 ft. and turned red, so I proactively announced "emergency descent" even though the cabin altitude was still below 10,000 ft. The FO read the QRC checklist and I began a descent with autopilot off and spoilers fully extended. At the same time I stated out loud, 'We need to go back to ZZZ.' The FO advised ATC of our descent and the desire to return to ZZZ. We were additionally cleared to turn right direct ZZZ. Once the descent was established, we began the right turn towards ZZZ. I noticed no traffic at all within 20 NM of the aircraft during the descent and turn back via TCAS on ND (Navigation Display), and out the windows. I selected Terrain on ND to ensure we were over water as expected. It was a pitch black night with no horizon or visual cues.As we descended, the cabin altitude continued to climb above 9,550 ft. but at a slower rate. Then approximately halfway through the descent, the Master Warning sounded as the cabin altitude reached 10,000 ft. Shortly thereafter the cabin began to descend as the aircraft got lower. I recall the cabin was only 100 - 200 ft. above 10,000 ft. for approximately 20 seconds. We did not don oxygen masks when the cabin altitude reached 10,000 ft. due to the high workload of hand-flying the descent on instruments and the transient nature of the excessive cabin altitude. We felt the priority was on maintaining safe control of the aircraft. A320 FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) 1 paragraph 5.1.2 states, "the pilot flying will be tasked with verifying the non-normal condition and confirming procedures… (but) it should not distract the pilot flying from his primary duty of safely flying the aircraft." However upon reflection, if the situation was progressing to the point where I thought declaring "emergency descent" was warranted, putting on our oxygen masks before beginning the descent would have been the better course of action. Upon leveling at 10,000 ft. we slowed to 250 kt., re-engaged the autopilot, verified we were navigating direct to ZZZ as cleared, and assessed the situation. The cabin altitude was below 10,000 ft. and cabin vertical speed was at -250 FPM, descending. In fact as we transited back at 10,000 ft., the cabin continued to descend normally and reached field elevation before we landed. We heard no unusual sounds indicating a leak of any kind. I next called the cabin to advise them of the situation and to check in on the cabin condition. They said everything was okay and the oxygen masks did not deploy. I told the F1 we were returning to ZZZ, landing in about 25 minutes. I said the landing would be normal but CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) may meet the aircraft. Next, we advised Dispatch via ACARS of our descent and plan to return to ZZZ. We initially set up the FMS for a return to ZZZ and ran the Overweight Landing Checklist. Planned landing weight was 154,000 lb. I then asked Dispatch if they preferred we go to ZZZ or ZZZ1, in case one was better than the other for our situation. Dispatch told us Operations Control preferred we go to ZZZ1 to facilitate an easier tail swap. We coordinated with ZZZ Center to divert to ZZZ1 and we reprogrammed the FMS again for ZZZ1. I continued to fly the aircraft and talk with ATC while the FO reprogrammed the FMS both times. ATC [provided priority handling] for us due to the descent, diversion, and planned overweight landing, and we concurred. I advised the flight attendants of our new plan to go to ZZZ1 and asked them to make a PA since we were in a descent below 10,000 ft. at this point and our workload was very high. The rest of the descent, approach and landing, ILS XXR ZZZ, were normal. Medium brakes were used per [the] software and max reverse per the Overweight Landing Checklist. Touchdown was in the touchdown zone at 200 FPM or less. ZZZ emergency equipment was dispatched to a location near the runway but they never approached the aircraft. We exited [Runway] XXR at [Taxiway] XX and taxied to [Taxiway] XY Gate XX normally.Brake fan use was delayed until brake temperatures reached 400°C on the left main gear, approximately 4 minutes after landing. Winds were 320 at 16 kt. for landing on [Runway] XXR. Brake temperatures never went much above 400°C and then began to cool. At the gate we wrote up the loss of pressurization and overweight landing. We debriefed Maintenance Control crew members face-to-face. We never ran the 'Diversion' checklist since both ZZZ and ZZZ1 are primary and well-known cities - we prioritized other necessary tasks. I provided the flight attendants all the information required for an event but I believe I may have failed to speak the words 'event' directly. The flight attendants confirmed with me after the flight that it was clear to them that it would be an event/normal landing.				A320 Captain reported the cabin was not pressurizing properly and the flight crew opted to divert. The aircraft had a pack that was on MEL, leaving only one pack available for use on the flight.

Tower asked if we saw the aircraft we're following? Dealing with trying to slow as much as possible and feeling the effects of the top of the heavy jet wake turbulence, the aircraft was blending into ground lights. I said I see a light ahead. The controller said not good enough. I said I clearly see the airport and runways. Controller said he needed to know if I saw the aircraft approaching 22 Right. I stated, "I don't see an aircraft for 22 Right BUT I DO HAVE THE AIRCRAFT AHEAD FOR 22 LEFT." Nothing further was said by ATC. TCAS showed the aircraft about 5 miles ahead and very short final. We slowed to minimum speed and continued without incident. After landing we were asked to call JFK Tower on a phone line. I spoke at length with the Supervisor and cleared up the questions together.We were "cleared for the ILS," not for the Visual. The first time we knew we were following a heavy jet was first checking with JFK Tower. We were "cleared to land" by JFK Tower. That clearance didn't change.				A320 Captain reported experiencing wake turbulence and having a communication breakdown with ATC while on final approach to the runway, in regards to whether the traffic landing on the other, parallel runway was in sight.

We opted to start both engines at the gate to ensure the #1 IDG (Integrated Drive Generator) came online correctly. All systems appeared to function normally. Climb-out, passing through the mid-teens, we had a Master Caution light illuminate with many systems illuminated on the recall. We analyzed the situation, initially thinking the light was the likely root cause of this situation, [and] quickly realizing that the issue was greater than just a TR (Transformer/Rectifier) failure. We started the QRH, we re-assessed the situation, and ran the QRH for a Left Generator failure. We noted that we did not have a Source Off light. Realizing that this was an entire system failure, based on a number of other system lights illuminated i.e., 2 fuel pumps, a HYD ELEC PUMP, ANTI ICE, YD, etc., we started the APU and got out of the QRH. The APU would not power the #1 Electrical Bus. I transferred control of the aircraft to the FO (First Officer) and I started coordinating with ZZZ Operations asking for a patch to Dispatch. FAs (Flight Attendant) called up and advised that they had absolutely no lights in the cabin. However, at some point during this event, the emergency lights did activate and give them some light in the cabin. Realizing that we lost ACARS during this even, we asked again for a patch to the Supervisor. Unable to get a patch, I spoke with ZZZ Local Maintenance on the radio and described what we had. Being that we were a single electrical system, and in agreement with their advice to return to ZZZ, we got priority handling into ZZZ. I made several PAs to the cabin, and several calls to the FAs to keep them informed on our intentions. I opted to use FMC-generated V/S and would use Autobrakes 3. On short final, the Autobrake Fail and Anti-Skid Fail lights illuminated. After landing, the APU and ground power would not power either side of the electrical system. Aircraft deplaning was done with emergency lights only. Post-flight, FAs were debriefed, and a conference call with Company Operations Center Chief Pilot, Manager on Call, Supervisor on Duty, and Dispatch was completed.				B737-700 Captain reported a Master Caution light illuminated during the climb-out and after some reassessment, realized there was an entire system failure. The flight crew performed an air turnback.

The flight was part of a [flight with a Check Airman] sequence. All appropriate checklists were completed and the aircraft returned to ZZZ for a successful, but overweight, landing. The biggest additive condition that occurred during this event was due to the multitude of requests for information from Dispatch during high workload times. Before we even had the chance to assess the engine condition, balance our response and communicate with ATC, there were 2 ACARS messages from Dispatch, followed by further requests, while we were executing the QRH Checklist, including the question, 'Did you [request priority handling]?' Once on the ground, ZZZ Operations and Dispatch were asking for information, while we were coordinating with the Airport Fire Response teams, ATC for a place to wait while the brakes cooled, and dealing with the passengers to set their expectations. All of these requests should have waited until the aircraft was at the gate.In a [situation] like this, requests for information, unless directly associated with ensuring a successful outcome, should be kept until the more immediate necessity of safely getting the aircraft on the ground has been accomplished. The numerous requests for information are an additive and task loading condition that the crew does not need while executing the QRH procedure. While I understand the need for information in the Company Operations Center, none of the requests were helpful to the crew. Dispatch pushing the weather and gate info to us via ACARS, plus a request to call when able would have helped. A checklist of who to contact would be helpful AFTER the aircraft is shut down, the passengers and crew are taken care of, and the crew has a chance to recover.		The event occurred on the ZZZZZ Departure at FL230. We had just been given climb to FL270. The autopilot and engine anti-ice were on. We experienced a yaw to the left and had indications of an engine failure. There was an engine failure cue for the #1 Engine and a rapid rise in EGT. Within 30 seconds the EGT was over 900 degrees and kept increasing. As the pilot flying, I kept flying and called for the engine failure QRH. The engine was shut down in accordance with the QRH. The EGT peaked just over 1,000 degrees, and did not go down until the checklist was run. We coordinated a return to ZZZ. [Priority handling was requested] and the landing with One Engine Inoperative Checklist was run. Since the Captain was in the right seat we elected to have them make the single engine landing. We landed in a flaps 15 configuration and met the fire equipment just off of Runway XX. No indications of fire inflight or on the ground were noted. Brake cooling calculations called for a 30-minute cooldown. The plane was returned to the gate with no injuries or further complications.		B737-800 flight crew reported the #1 Engine failed during the climb and proceeded to shut down the affected engine. The flight crew then performed an air turnback.

As we climbed, we turned to the vector assigned. I was the Pilot Flying. As I was in the turn, I lost the DG and the Map. We realized we lost our IRSs (Inertial Reference System). I rolled out at what I thought was close to the heading assigned (fortunately it was a VMC conditions and I still had airspeed and altitude). The Captain switched to Departure and we got another turn further to the south. At that point, as I began a left turn, the Captain told Departure that we were having a Directional Gyro problem and that we needed to trouble shoot the problem. He did not request priority handling as he thought we could remedy the problem. After going through the QRH we realized we were not going to be able to fix the problem. The sun was setting and we needed to turn back to the field ASAP before dark. We started getting no gyro turns toward the field. At that point, the Captain took over flying and I set us up for approach to XXL. I got the ZZZ information and we went through the descent approach checklists. I also sent a message to Dispatch. We got the airport in sight and we were cleared for the visual. The landing was overweight but uneventful. On landing, we rolled to the end, in order to not overheat the brakes. We pulled of the runway and stopped so I could run the brake cooling ACARS program. ACARS said no action was required, so we continued the taxi back to the Gate.		On takeoff from Runway XXL in ZZZ, Master Caution came on showing Yaw Damper OFF. Continued with safe takeoff and on climb out, after clean up saw that the DG had failed and IRS had failed. We leveled off, let ATC know of the problems and got a heading to go to QRC, after that it was decided that the safe course of action would be to land before dark on a visual approach to Runway XXL which we did. Ran all checklists and numbers notified Dispatch, Flight Attendants and Passengers and ATC and landed overweight, smooth touchdown and no brakes until under 100 knots. Did brake cooling then returned to Gate.		B737 flight crew reported a failure of the yaw damper during the take off roll and a subsequent failure of the IRS. The crew completed a no gyro approach back to the departure airport for a precautionary landing.

Cleared to land by Tower, VMC conditions. They informed us of of a Military helicopter working to the east of final and that they would remain there. The helo was close to the water as you could see the spray. As we got closer to the runway, it turned west. We watched the helo and expected it to turn east again. It never did. We went around visually at approximately 500 [ft.] AGL. There were no TCAS indications. We don't think their TCAS was turned on. The helo was encroaching on the final of the ILS. We missed it by a few hundred ft. as it went under us. I don't think either helo pilot ever saw us. We brought up our dissatisfaction with Tower on the go-around and called Dispatch when we landed. I also spoke to the Chief Pilot and the ATC Representative on duty.		We were on final approach into ZZZ cleared on the ILS Runway XX to ZZZ. Approach switched us to Tower and I checked in. Tower cleared us to land and notified us of a pair of Military helicopters east of the final approach course performing maneuvers. Tower also said that they should remain to the east of the final approach course. I told Tower we were looking and continued the approach. Neither of the helicopters showed up on our TCAS. The Captain was the first to see the helicopters and told me where they were. I finally saw them and reported them insight to Tower as he had told us where they were again. Tower said they should stay over to the east. We continued the approach. Probably around our 1000 [ft.] call, we noticed one of the helicopters had started to climb and was heading towards the final approach corridor for [Runway] XX which we were on. We both noted it and both expected the helicopter to start a turn east bound. Instead, the helicopter continued straight on a course that would have put him on a collision course with us, my guess is around 300 [ft.] MSL. Very shortly afterward, we were at about 500 [ft.] when the Captain called for the go-around as I had started to say it as well. We executed the go-around. I lost sight of the helicopter as we pitched up, but the Captain told me it never changed course and flew directly beneath us. We executed the missed approach and circled back around for a visual approach, which was successful and taxied to the gate with no further incidents. We told both Tower and Approach what happened and the Captain called it in to the Company Operations Center once we were parked at the gate. We never had the helicopter on TCAS and never received a TA or RA. We had the helicopter visually and executed the go-around based on our visual with the helicopter.		Air Carrier B737-800 flight crew reported a NMAC when military helicopter deviated from ATC coordinated flight path into the air carrier's approach path, without TCAS warning.

We both thought that we heard ATC descend us to 4200 ft. MSL from 5200 ft. We began descending and asked Approach to clarify the circling altitude for the approach. ATC advised us that the minimum vectoring altitude was 5000 ft., and asked us to climb back to 5000 ft. (we were descending through 4600 ft. MSL). We climbed back up to 5000 ft. promptly. We are not sure if we misheard the Controller's radio call and descended in error, or if the Controller actually gave us the descent in error. We are both fairly confident we heard the call correctly but were task saturated at the time and recognize that it could have been our fault. The rest of the flight transpired without issue.		[Report narrative contained no additional information.]		Air carrier flight crew reported a CFIT event during approach after descending from the assigned altitude. The flight crew climbed to the assigned altitude and the flight continued without issues.

Ground Control instructed taxi to Runway XXL for departure and gave us a wheels up time of +15 min. We were then switched to Tower frequency with Aircraft Y holding short of Runway XXL full length and us as Aircraft X. Tower asked us to pull into the hold block for XXL to allow Aircraft Z behind us to access the runway via intersection Taxiway 1. Tower then gave Aircraft Z take off clearance from intersection Taxiway 1 but denied back taxi for full length. Aircraft Z then declined the takeoff clearance and informed Tower they would need to reload data and perform a checklist. After landing traffic on XXL, Tower asked Aircraft Z if they could move to give us access to the Runway via Taxiway 1, so we could make our wheels up time. Aircraft Y had a later wheels up time and was still holding short full length XXL. Aircraft Z was cleared to taxi down Runway XXL and clear Taxiway 2 back onto Taxiway 3. We were instructed to hold short of Runway XXL at Taxiway 1. I chose to hold our position in the hold block while we dealt with the additive condition of task loading with a runway change. Tower asked if we could take Taxiway 1. We replied on the radio that we needed a minute to load new data and run a checklist. Tower responded that we had 50 seconds to make our wheels up time or we would need a new wheels up time. I responded to please get us a new wheels up time. Traffic permitting, Tower then cleared Aircraft Y and Aircraft Z for departure, leaving us as the only aircraft in the holding block. Tower informed us of our new wheels up time. We asked Tower if we should now expect a full length departure from XXL to which they replied, 'Stand by.' Approximately five minutes passed with no response from Tower on departure point. Approaching our new wheels up time, Tower instructed us to taxi up to and hold short of Runway XXL full length. With the intersection data loaded, I told Tower that each time they change our departure point, we need to load new data and run a checklist. Tower changed out taxi instructions to taxi up to and hold short of Runway XXL at Taxiway 1. As we taxied, the First Officer had deleted our data, when our clearance was for full length, but then reloaded when our taxi instructions changed to the intersection of Taxiway 1. As we approached XXL at Taxiway 1, Tower issued what we thought was position and hold on Runway XXL at Taxiway 1. With the additive conditions of task loading to accomplish the Before Take Off Checklist and the operational pressure to make our wheels up time along with meeting minimum fuel requirements for the flight, I was getting behind and did not hear Towers second clearance. I believe both the First Officers and I's expectation bias led us to believe that a second instruction from Tower would be a line up and wait. I did rely on my First Officers response to the call, which was line up and wait XXL at Taxiway 1. Tower did not catch our error nor make any correction. As I entered the runway at Taxiway 1, I cleared final and saw company aircraft at 800 ft on final approach. I thought it was tight but it fit into my expectation bias that Tower was trying to make our wheels up time since they had emphasized our first wheels up time. As I lined up on centerline for Runway XXL, I expected a takeoff clearance but none was received. After an awkward silence and glancing at the TCAS display and now seeing company at 600 ft on final I got the sinking feeling that there may have been a miscommunication. The next radio call was Tower instructing company to go around. Tower then asked us to copy down a phone number for possible pilot deviation. I think several things led to this communication error and runway incursion. I think the Tower Controller could understand the task loading created with multiple runway changes for intersection departures. Our error was allowing additive conditions to put us behind as a crew and then letting our expectation bias for makingour wheels up time. This resulted in the communication error of reading back the wrong clearance. In the future I will not allow myself to take the runway if I feel behind for any reason regardless of a wheels up time.		While taxiing to Runway XXL for departure, Tower informed us of a flow time to ZZZ1 and instructed us to pull into the hold pad. There was an aircraft holding short of the runway at Taxiway 4 intersection for the full length. As our flow time approached, Tower told us that we would have to depart from Taxiway 1 intersection, and that we would not be able to back taxi. At this time we informed Tower that we would have to re-run our performance numbers and it would take a few minutes. Tower responded that they would have to get a new flow time for us, which we said was OK.After we had new performance numbers for the Taxiway 1 intersection departure, we let Tower know and received a new flow time. While we were waiting for our new flow time, the aircraft that was on Taxiway 4 for the full length departed. We asked which intersection we could plan on departing from, since we would have to re-run our numbers again for full length. Tower told us to standby, but never answered our question. As our new flow time approached, Tower told us to taxi to the full length intersection at Taxiway 4, at which time we informed them that we would have to change our performance numbers again. As we were in the process of changing our performance numbers, Tower instructed us to hold short of the runway at the Taxiway 1 intersection. It was during this time of high workload, while undoing the changes we had begun to make so we could meet our flow time, that we mistook Tower's instruction for a lineup and wait clearance. When reading back the instructions, we read back 'Runway XXL at Taxiway 1 lineup and wait,' and did not get any response or challenge from Tower. After lining up on the runway at Taxiway 1, we expected immediate takeoff clearance as there was an aircraft on final, but the clearance didn't come and the landing aircraft was instructed to go around. Once that aircraft was clear we were informed of the possible pilot deviation. We were then given takeoff clearance. If we had gotten earlier communications from Tower about the sequence of aircraft and the need for an intersection departure, we could've avoided the additive conditions that led us to be behind. If Tower had answered our question of what takeoff point we could expect for our new sequence we could've re-programmed our performance numbers while we were waiting, and we wouldn't have been task loaded at the last minute approaching our flow time. If we had told Tower we could only accept a Taxiway 1 intersection departure, when Tower instructed us to taxi for the full length, we could have avoided another last second change, which led to us being task loaded and miss hearing the second taxi instruction from Tower. If Tower had clarified our clearance after we read back XXL at Taxiway 1 lineup and wait we wouldn't have deviated from the initial instructions we were given.		Air carrier flight crew reported a communication breakdown between flight crew and ATC which resulted in a critical ground conflict.

At approximately DYLIN we encountered a slightly rolling, moderate turbulence that felt like wake. The jolt of turbulence immediately subsided and I called to ensure that flight attendants were seated. The response I got was roughly 'not quite', so I got on the PA and advised 'Flight Attendants, take your jumpseats.' A few moments later we received a call from the cabin that 2 flight attendants in the rear were hurt. We advised ATC of the moderate turbulence. The turbulence came on again and for the most part was bumpy until landing. We contacted the flight attendants once more and were advised that the two flight attendants had fallen during the encounter. One had hurt their arm and hand and the other their back but they were fine otherwise. We landed uneventfully and I observed and spoke with the flight attendants afterwards. They said they were in a bit of pain but could perform their duties and retrieved their suitcases from the overhead. They advised me that they were fine but were going to go to the clinic as a precaution.

PF (Pilot Flying) quickly put hands on controls, autopilot attempted to correct, but it quickly got worse, and it was evident this was wake turbulence. Right wing dropped further, PM (Pilot Monitoring) announced upset, autopilot was disconnected, and bank was corrected as we got out of the wake. Momentarily received 'bank angle' aural warning as PF fought to correct and counteract wake turbulence. We inquired with ATC and was told we were following a 767 freighter, and we chose to pull back our speed and climb above their path, and ATC gave us direct to a different fix (JAGOR) which slightly offset our route, there was no more wake encountered in the flight.We took off being the 767, and it seemed spacing was adequate by the time we took off, but we clipped their wake, they climbed much faster, both in rate of climb but also in speed, at the time of event they were around 8 mi. ahead, and eventually were nearly 20 miles ahead of us on the SID. It's possible we were given a takeoff clearance with less than prescribed. The 767 was given a heading of 090 on departure, and we were cleared RNAV JAMBA, which is roughly a 30 degree right turn off the runway, so I assumed the 767 was on a different SID/departure path, but that wasn't the case.Maybe more spacing, or being told we were following a heavy. Despite taking off behind the heavy, they were issued a different departure heading, while we were on the SID, so this lead me/us, to believe we wouldn't be following the heavy on the departure except for the initial few hundred ft. off the departure end.		Encountered wake turbulence from a 767 10 miles ahead of us as we were climbing through 12000. Event occurred quickly with autopilot engaged. Aircraft aural warning bank angle sounded as autopilot was disengaged by PF (Pilot Flying) to recover from upset. Continued normal flight ATC should space aircraft further apart.		B737-800 flight crew reported an inflight upset occurred after encountering wake turbulence departing MIA in trail of a B767.

[The] Captain advised me about the event. The Captain immediately told me and communicated with ATC that we [were requesting priority handling] to ZZZ1 Airport. We both donned our masks and executed the [appropriate] descent procedure. As we were descending, ATC gave us a new instruction. Level off at FL250. We set that on the FCU. We had a traffic advisory, and ATC notified us about it. We dialed the VS on the FCU less than 1500 feet per minute to successfully avoid an RA.After crossing the traffic, we selected a lower altitude on the FCU (10000); as we were descending, both cockpit crews were having issues transmitting to ATC with our masks on. So I removed my mask and used the hand mike to communicate and reaffirm the [situation]. We requested the weather and runway in use at ZZZ1. The weather was provided for Runway XX. As we loaded the MCDU with all the details, we ran the [appropriate] checklist procedure. We loaded the flight [company software] with the landing details and proceeded with the approach checklist.On the final approach to Runway XX, we discussed the need to evacuate and confirmed that no actions were required. We did this twice. We review out loud the next course of action. Once on the ground and the aircraft stopped, I announced via the PA to the flight attendants at stations. After discussing with [the] Captain the state of the aircraft, the Captain communicated with the passengers the next course of action.  The Captain informed the passengers we would taxi the airplane to the gate assigned. I announce three times passengers remain seated. We spoke with the fire chief and proceeded to taxi the aircraft. We Completed all checklists. Once at the gate and the parking checklist completed, the Captain gave the order to disembark the passengers as the residual smell was still present in the cabin.Two fire extinguishers bottles were used. One PBE (protective breathing equipment) and some passengers helped to combat the fire.  A retired firefighter, deadheading crew members and Flight Attendant all went above and beyond.		I was conducting OE (Operational Evaluation) on a Captain upgrade and occupying the right seat, While in level flight at FL 270, I was the PM (pilot Monitoring), First Officer PF (Pilot Flying).  Also onboard we had a Check FA (Flight Attendant) and two FAs receiving OE in the cabin, 4 jumpseaters onboard seated in the cabin not too far from the source of the fire.Approximately XA32 we received a call from the cabin, advising us of the [situation] with smoke coming out of an overhead bin mid cabin. She hung up, at the same time we got a frequency change from ATC  that went unacknowledged, [FA] called back and confirmed an uncontrolled [situation] mid cabin from an overhead bin.  As a cockpit crew we donned 02 masks and I attempted to respond to ATC, but the mask mic was transmitting poorly.  After two attempts from myself and one from [PF], I took my mask back off and confirmed with ATC we had a [situation] and were diverting to ZZZ1.  I instructed PF to keep his mask on during the descent while I worked the radios.  We operated in this fashion until below 10,000 feet.Also during this time, Over the PA I briefed passengers on the diversion.  FA called me at some point around 10,000 and said the [situation] was out and the cabin was prepared for landing.We completed the [appropriate], checklists for approach and landing, [PF] completed landing data for ZZZ1 on [Company system], and he confirmed again with FAs  prior to landing that the [situation was contained].  We briefed ourselves and the FAs that we would stop and speak to the fire chief after landing, and that we did not anticipate evacuation.  After landing, [PF] called FAs to stations, I spoke to the [ground personnel] and confirmed with them the [situation was contained] and established a plan for taxi to a gate.  [PF], asked FAs to remain seated and we advised passengers that we were taxing to a gate to deplane.  Once at the gate, I coordinated the deplaning as quickly as possible specifically due to the strong odor remaining in the cabin. Two of passengers were treated by paramedics on the aircraft and once all passengers had deplaned I made a gate announcement asking anyone who felt the need for medical care to please come forward and see paramedics.  Several more passengers were cared for gate side, eventually the FAs were also taken to the hospital for evaluation.I was advised by jumpseater, and Lead FA that they along with a nearby passenger assisted in [controlling] the [electronic device] that was inside of a backpack.  Passenger burns his hands while pulling the wet [electronic device] from the backpack.  The device was placed in water per procedure and the fire source was isolated.  Two halon extinguishers were used.  A PBE was opened, but not used as the fire was already extinguished.		Air carrier flight crew reported a passenger's electronic device experienced a thermal runaway during cruise. The flight crew requested and was provided priority handling to a diversion airport where the flight landed safely.

The 'reject' and ' my aircraft' calls were made and as Pilot In Command (PIC), I assumed control and brought the aircraft to a stop on the runway. I made the PA to the Passengers to remain seated 3 times and advised the Flight Attendants (FA) that we had a problem. The Co-pilot was already talking to Tower about our situation. The Tower Controllers initially thought we blew a tire but we informed them we had an Engine Failure. They asked if we required Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) assistance and initially after making a quick assessment we told them no. We knew no QRH checklist existed for an engine failure on the ground so, initially we did not run a QRH checklist. I recall either we asked the Tower or the Tower Controller said he may have seen smoke. At that point I told the Co-pilot to ask Tower to roll the ARFF. The exchange from the Tower gave us the impression that whatever smoke they may have seen was slightly after the engine had failed. I made the decision that it was safe to taxi and we parked in-front of the fire house at ZZZ airport. We elected to run the engine fire QRH doing only items we deemed applicable. We called and informed Operations of our dilemma and spoke to Maintenance and were given a gate. I made a PA telling the Passengers that vehicles would approach the aircraft from both sides but this was only precautionary. I spoke directly to the ARFF Fire Commander and asked them to asses the engines and wheel areas of the aircraft for signs of damage, smoke, fire etc. I asked if they saw anything that would prevent a safe taxi to the gate, they responded that they saw no signs as such. We had a few passengers get up to use the lavatory and I had to make a PA twice I recall to remind them that we needed them seated. I asked ARFF to follow us to the gate. Maintenance met us at the gate while they secured the data they needed, I stood at the door to personally thank every single passenger as they deplaned. I was told by Maintenance that my logbook entry had to be more precise on what speed we aborted at. I recalled somewhere around 92 knots which I put in the logbook. The Chief Pilot and a representative met us at the gate and we explained what happened. None come to mind, maintenance is more apt to answer this question. Again, until I know exactly what caused the left engine to fail, answering this question would purely be premature in my humble opinion.		All was well with our flight everything called for and completed as per standard operating procedures. Lined up on [Runway] XXR, engines spooled and stabilized at 40 % N1. I was the Pilot Flying (PF) at this time. I clicked TOGA and made the call. The 80 kts call was made and checked by myself when I noticed I needed a lot more right rudder than usual. Below approximately 90 kts, a huge explosion could be heard the plane started pulling to the left at this time. Firm right rudder was applied to maintain center line. The reject call was made, the Captain (CA) assumed controls of the aircraft and brought the airplane to a stop at that time. The Captain was on the PA I was speaking with the Tower. We both assessed and both confirmed it was indeed an engine failure on the number 1 engine. We were asked by Tower if we could have taxied off the runway on our own power but we still were in assessment stage. Eventually we got the airplane rolling and we were told by another airplane smoke was coming out the number one engine. I called ATC and asked the fire trucks to meet us in the pad closest to the fire station to give us a look. Once the parking brake was set I made a check to see if there was an engine failure on the ground checklist. There was none. Just as a precaution we ran over a few items of the engine failure checklist just to be sure and that applied to our current situation. The Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) checked us out and we were cleared thereafter to go to the gate and we were followed by the fire trucks.		B737 flight crew reported an engine failure during the takeoff roll at approximately 90 knots. The crew performed a rejected takeoff and was notified by ATC of visible smoke from the failed engine. After an inspection by fire crews the flight taxied back to the gate.

We were cleared to intercept the course and once established cleared the ILS for XX. We were hustling down to 3,000 ft. and trying to slow and configure and realized we hadn't armed the approach (GS) function and did just as the aircraft was leveling and the GS was below us thinking it would arm. We configured and had a large ground speed mini factor with turbulence that made it difficult to get fully configured. Once we were we completed the before landing checklist and then realized the AP had not captured the GS and we were below glide slope and descending. So we arrested the decent and then executed a go around. On the go we got an altitude and heading from tower and during the clean up stage got a master warning for a Vfe exceeded as the flaps were in retraction from flaps one to zero even though the barber pole had already jump above our current airspeed as we selected them up before our airspeed could enter the barber pole territory. Cleaned up and completed a successful approach to ILS XX with moderate turbulence and a ground speed mini that was close to thirty knots over Vapp. Called Maintenance Control once at the gate and told them the situation with the flaps and they said not to write it up since our airspeed never showed us in the actual barber pole. [Event caused by] getting a slam dunk approach in IMC with turbulence and wind shear made it difficult to get get established and stable. With those factors and the AP not capturing the GS and not recognizing that right away while being focused on getting slowed and configured more than we should've we comprised the approach. We fixated on one or two issues and forgot our scan for a few moments that lead to the go around. ATC not giving the usual VFR slam dunk approach with IMC conditions with active weather. More Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) awareness in that task saturated situation and awareness of the approach vs where the plane is and what it's doing by both the Pilot Monitoring (PM) and Pilot Flying (PF).		Cleared by ATC to join the XX localizer at ZZZ during a 'slam dunk' decent clearance. While descending on XX LOC ATC clears our flight for the approach during which time we were above the vertical profile. As Pilot Flying (PF) I delayed arming approach mode while trying to descend to join the vertical profile. At GS intercept altitude the approach mode was armed but did not capture. The aircraft began a decent through the GS and I did not realize the autopilot had not captured the GS. Once the First Officer (FO) and I realized the aircraft had not captured the GS and we were still descending below GS path (VMC) a go-around was executed. Tower at ZZZ gave us radar vectors for a 2nd approach that was completed successfully to an uneventful landing. [The event was caused by a] short night evening before event followed by long multi-leg (4) work day sequence construction.		Air carrier flight crew reported receiving a 'slam dunk' approach clearance that resulted in a go around. Tower provided vectors for a second approach which landed safely.

I took control of the aircraft saying 'my aircraft'. We had two good Airspeed Indicators with mine and the Standby agreeing at approximately 160 KIAS. We were VMC with the runway in sight so I felt the safest action was to continue to landing since the aircraft was under control with two reliable Airspeed Indicators. We advised ATC and continued to a safe landing. Failure of FO airspeed indicator. Continue practicing startle factor events in recurrent sim training as that was key to our positive reaction to this event.		While being vectored for the ILS XXR my Airspeed Indications on my side started to give inaccurate information, this was followed by an immediate stick shaker on my side. I immediately added power and started to try and diagnose the situation. The Captain acted confidently and decisively and immediately assumed control of the aircraft since his indications were reliable. This was cross checked with the Standby Indications and we both agreed his side was good. We also agreed since we were VMC to continue the landing. We advised ATC and landed without incident. Not sure about prevention but continued practice of procedures help mitigate occurrence.		B737 flight crew reported a failure of the First Officer's airspeed indicator on final approach. The crew verified that the Captain had two good Airspeed Indications and continued the approach and landed without issues at the destination airport.

Encounter was significant, causing aircraft to roll left to approximately 30 deg AOB. AP was disconnected by CA (PF) (Captain Pilot Flying) and return to straight and level flight was completed. Re-engaged AP and continued climb. I (CA) then handed controls and radios to FO (First Officer) and called back to the cabin, where I was informed that a passenger (XX_01), approximately 55 yrs old, female) who had been in the aft galley waiting to use the aft lav, had fallen during the aircraft roll and impacted the slide compartment on door 2R. Passenger indicated she had twisted her knee/leg and then went into the bathroom. Upon hearing this, I initiated a 'call me' with Dispatch to get medlink on the line and awaited further details. While awaiting status of our passenger, myself, my FO and our jumpseater collected flight parameter details. As noted, 30 deg left AOB (Angle of Bank) occurred, AP disconnected. Of note: no overspeed was experienced, no 1g was felt, and no 'bank angle, bank angle' audio was heard. When referenced, did not 'drop a turbulence pellet'. Entire sequence lasted maybe 3 seconds and no turbulence was called for by ATC, noted on WSI, [display] or FD Pro High Level views. FA (Flight Attendant) got back to me and informed me that passenger was in pain but had made it back to her seat. She was in a center seat but we had her reseated to an aisle seat for comfort. I asked FA to ask passenger if she would like to have aircraft met by EMTs (Yes) and/or did she want us to divert (No) given approximately 1hr of flight time remaining to ZZZ1. Meanwhile, got on the radio with Medlink and gave all the details. Dr. advised ice pack and 3 acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) from the kit be administered. Passenger refused the Tylenol and a cold pack had already been applied by the FAs. Made a passenger announcement somewhere in here letting folks know that we had encountered an aircraft wake, and that the aircraft was fine and we would be proceeding to our destination. Coordinated with Dispatch to have aircraft met by EMTs with an aisle chair, and backed this up with an ACARS msg to Station. Informed Center and ZZZ1 Approach that we would like an approach to Runway XXR as it expedited taxi to the gate. Approach, landing, and taxi in were uneventful and all other passengers were asked to (and complied) remain seated until this passenger was removed by EMTs.				B737NG Captain reported a minor passenger injury resulted from a wake turbulence encounter at FL340 in ZDC airspace.

[We] requested a climb to FL380 per the flight plan and were cleared by ATC to climb from FL340 to FL380 after the opposite direction traffic had passed by on the right side (west of our track, distance unknown). The light level outside was dusk and the aircraft above and to the right was not producing contrails. Winds were out of the west at 100 kts. No turbulence had been encountered at cruise and the fasten seat belt sign was off. Shortly after the CA (PF) (Captain Pilot Flying) initiated the climb, the aircraft rolled to the left approximately 30 degrees and shook violently from the encounter. The PF disengaged the autopilot, rolled back to wings level, and re-engaged the autopilot to continue the climb. No 'bank angle, bank angle' aural alert occurred. The FO (PM) (First Officer Pilot Monitoring) turned on the fasten seat belt sign and instructed the Flight Attendants over the PA:  'Flight Attendants, take your seats.' (The FO did not use standard phraseology for a turbulence encounter due to the startle effect). The encounter lasted for less than 5 seconds. No deviation from the cleared routing or altitude was noted as the CA was quickly able to regain control of the aircraft. The CA transferred aircraft control and radios to the FO while the CA had the flight attendants check in. Upon check in, the CA learned that a passenger waiting to use the aft lavatory fell into the cover for the escape slide at 2R and twisted her right knee/leg. The CA contacted Dispatch for a discrete frequency and then Medlink to discuss treatment options. In the course of determining the extent of the passenger's injuries, the CA offered diversion to the passenger which the passenger declined. Medlink recommended a cold compress and three acetaminophen tablets from the medical kit. The flight attendants had already applied the cold compress but the passenger refused the acetaminophen. The CA and FO determined the turbulence would have been classified as severe. Since the aircraft was flying normally, there was no concern of structural damage from the short duration event. Nothing other than normal Gs were sensed by the flight deck crew. No turbulence from the event was displayed on [display]. We discussed whether we should request priority handling or declare an emergency. The CA and FO determined the best course of action, based on Medlink's assessment of the injuries and recommendations, was to continue to the destination and have EMTs meet the aircraft at the gate. Normal checklists were completed for the descent and arrival into ZZZ1. We were already flying at a high cost index so we were flying at the fastest speed for the arrival into ZZZ1. ATIS was calling for arrivals to XXL. We requested and were granted to fly an approach to Runway XXR after a brief explanation to ATC. Runway XXR had a shorter taxi distance to the ramp and fewer turns to our gate. After an uneventful landing, the CA taxied as fast as practical to arrive at the gate quickly. EMTs were standing by at the gate. We left the seatbelt sign on until the injured passenger was transported off the aircraft using a straight back wheelchair.	Reporter stated he was surprised to encounter a wake this powerful at cruise altitude, one strong enough to trigger a momentary stall event.			B737NG FO reported a passenger was injured during a wake turbulence encounter with an opposite direction B737 at FL340 in Jacksonville Center airspace.

I was conducting OE for the First Officer (FO). This was to be the FO's first takeoff as PF (Pilot Flying). We were originally going to use runway XX, but at some point, the winds had shifted sufficiently, so we were advised by ATC that we would be departing on runway XY. Takeoff data was obtained for Runway XY, and do due to variability of winds, we decided to use max power for the takeoff. Engine start was normal, the after start checklist was completed normally, and we taxied out for departure. We were cleared for takeoff, and there was [an aircraft] on final. Apparently, it's a slight uphill gradient from taxiway onto the runway because I had to carry power to keep the aircraft moving, on the order of around 30% N1 rpm. Since we were already cleared for takeoff, I left that power in as I transferred control and told [the First Officer] it was his aircraft. The aircraft was aligned with the runway when I told the FO it was his aircraft. He continued to advance the throttles, engaged TOGA, and I split my attention between looking outside and monitoring the engine instruments. While checking how well the FO was tracking centerline, I noticed the aircraft drifting left of centerline. Not knowing if the FO was correcting, and seeing that I must take immediate corrective action, I applied right rudder. The aircraft continued to drift left. I added more rudder then looked down to see the right engine at max power, and the left engine's EPR needle indication at around the 8 o'clock position. Rejected the takeoff before RTO was armed (less than 85 knots). We returned to the gate. Maintenance met the aircraft. I spoke with the mechanics as they were diagnosing the problem. They informed me that the auto throttle system had failed a BITE test. We remained at the aircraft while [the company] and station ops determined what to do. The mechanics mentioned that they did not have anyone qualified to taxi the aircraft, or to do an engine run. Eventually, we left for the hotel. Prior to retiring for the evening, I checked in [the scheduling system], and noted the asymmetrical thrust that we wrote up was still open, and the entry that the BITE test had failed. When I woke up, I checked the scheduling system again, and there was no mention of the BITE test failure, and only an entry that the engine passed all run up tests. In retrospect, I should have taken a screenshot of the previous night's log history.		Normal engine indications up to clearance for take off. Aircraft was transferred to Pilot Flying (PF) (First Officer (FO)) with thrust levers slightly out of idle. FO applied thrust to advance to roughly 50%. Thrust levers and engine indications advanced normally. TOGA switches were pressed, and both Thrust Levers advanced. The aircraft yawed to the left, and the FO and Captain immediately applied full right rudder to prevent going off the runway. The Captain rejected the take-off, pulled both engines to idle. The Captain reported seeing asymmetric thrust with the left engine lagging behind the right engine which had accelerated to maximum thrust. The FO was focused on rudder and runway alignment at the time of reject and did not note engine N1 at the time of reject but both throttles had advanced simultaneously after TOGA was pressed. Rejected take off was accomplished at low speed without incident. Dispatch and Maintenance notified.		B777 flight crew reported asymmetric thrust and auto throttle failure on take off power application. The Captain rejected the take off and the flight crew returned to the gate for maintenance.

I tried to trim in either direction but there was no response. I asked the Captain if he can try his, but when he did there was no response. We stopped climbing and leveled at 8,000 ft. and the Captain completed the QRH procedures while I flew the aircraft. The Captain noticed the STAB TRIM CONT. breaker on the wall behind my seat OPEN. We climbed to 10,000 ft. and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance. We returned to ZZZ for a Runway XXC landing with no future issues. Open circuit breaker, Stab Trim Cont. Suggestions - regular service and maintenance.		B737-800 flight crew reported the Pitch Trim was inoperative during climb-out. The flight leveled off and the flight crew determined that an open circuit breaker for the stab trim control was the cause. The flight crew then opted to perform an air turnback.

They mentioned this to me and after I looked over and began to smell a burning smell that quickly intensified. I also noticed what appeared to be some haze potentially from smoke. The Captain retained control of the aircraft and we immediately donned our oxygen masks and I began working the QRC. We then had a frequency change and I checked in [to advise ATC]. The Controller tried to change our runway to XXL but we elected to land on XXR which we had previously briefed and to avoid adding to our workload. We landed without further incident and the fumes seemed to clear. The Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) evaluated our aircraft for hot spots which didn't exist and we taxied to the gate where they made further checks. After the event, Maintenance found a burned wire and also replaced the Captain PFD.		On descent into ZZZ on Aircraft X, and passing through approximately 9000 ft., I had on the Captain's side Primary Flight Display (PFD) (while I was flying) go completely black. Then the PFD appeared on the side of the NAV display and the NAV display appeared on the side of the PFD. Soon after that, the First Officer (FO) and I smelled a very strong electrical burning smell. We both donned our oxygen masks. We [advised ATC] and ran the appropriate QRC checklist for smoke & fumes. There was a haze in the flight deck near the Captain's side of the aircraft. We rolled the Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF). The Flight Attendants (FAs) were notified. ATC asked us for the total souls on board and fuel remaining. I landed uneventfully on Runway XXR (the runway we were set up for and previously given). We cleared the runway and the ARFF checked the aircraft for hot spots. No hot spots were found. I took off my oxygen mask to check the flight deck fumes and it seemed that the fumes had dissipated. I made an announcement to the passengers and we taxied to the gate. The fire trucks followed us to the gate. Once we arrived at the gate, both the FO and I opened our windows and ran the shutdown checklist. The Lead Fire Fighter came on the flight deck and checked the flight deck temperature with a hand held device and said it appeared that the temperatures were normal in the flight deck. The Fire Fighter gave the FO and I a 'fist bump' and said great job. It was brought to my attention that maintenance took the aircraft out of service and later found 'broken wires' and replaced these wires. Better inspections could be helpful.		A320 flight crew reported a loss of the Captain's PFD and ND on final approach with an electrical smell and smoke noticeable in the cockpit. The flight crew donned O2 masks and continued to destination airport where a maintenance inspection discovered wiring issues.

While cruising at 39,000 ft., we received a Master Caution with a Y ENG 2 PUMP LO PR ECAM Message. We accomplished the ECAM actions, and analyzed the Hydraulic and Status pages. The Yellow System Fluid level was well below normal but there was still a small amount in the reservoir. We reviewed the ECAM procedure and discussed a plan of action. There were no significant in flight issues, but the affected systems on the status page eliminated Nose Wheel Steering, Reverser 2 and Ground Spoilers 2 and 4. We discussed alternate airports and decided that ZZZ was the most suitable given our proximity and the combination of wind straight down the runway, runway length, Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) services and available Maintenance. In the meantime we received associated ECAM Messages for Y RSVR LO LVL and Y SYS LO PR. We reviewed the ECAM actions, which required no additional steps beyond those we had already taken and reviewed the COMM procedures. The Hydraulic Fluid Level continued to decrease throughout the flight but did not change our analysis of the situation. After [requesting priority handling] with ZZZ Center we contacted Maintenance and Dispatch via ACARS, who relayed the situation to Base Operations at ZZZ. The Captain made the appropriate announcement to the Passengers. From there we proceeded to ZZZ, requesting longer vectors to account for slow flap deployment. Once safely on the ground we came to a stop on the runway and had ARFF inspect the aircraft for damage and had a Company Mechanic specifically inspect the Nose Gear. We continued to update the Passengers. The Captain was able to safely taxi the aircraft off the runway and to the ramp where we were met by Maintenance and deplaned the Passengers.				First Officer reported receiving a Master Caution with a Y ENG 2 PUMP LO PR ECAM Message in cruise. The flight crew elected to divert.

We briefed the threat as I experienced the same EICAS four months ago. We briefed to monitor the Fuel Synoptic after we got the Fuel Low Center EICAS to monitor the Fuel Balance. In cruise once we got that EICAS we monitored the Fuel Synoptic at XA29. The Fuel Values were (63.4/1.8/64.0) (L/C/R) for an Imbalance of 600 pounds. The Left Engine had a fuel flow of 300 pounds higher per hour. At XB13 it was (58.2/2.0/59.3) for an imbalance of 1,100 pounds. At XB42 it was (54.5/1.7/56.0) for an imbalance of 1,500 pounds. At XC19 it was (49.0/0.2/52.2) for an imbalance of 3,300 pounds. We discussed why the Center Tank Fuel was at 0.2 when the fuel scavenge was not supposed to operate yet, due to the main tank fuel being above the onset value per the FM system section. Fuel Imbalance EICAS annunciated, and we accomplished the checklist, made an ELB write up. Contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss the issue, they advised to keep monitoring and we gave Maintenance Control all the data above. During re-balancing we reviewed the Fuel Leak checklist and started monitoring the progress pages for totalizer fuel and calculated fuel as well as fuel remaining at ZZZ. After re-balancing we saw the imbalance numbers start to rise again. At XD12 the fuel was (42.4/0.0/44.8) for an imbalance of 2,400 pounds. At XD42 the fuel was (38.5/0.0/41.8) for an imbalance of 3,300 pounds. The :30 rate of difference was 900 pounds for XD42 and then at XE12 was 1,000 pounds. All other indications were normal the fuel totalizer and calculated fuel difference started at 1,300 pounds and went down to 400 pounds over this time period. The fuel remaining at touchdown remained consistent with our flight conditions. The HOWGOZIT fuel and the time reflected our flight. The Relief Pilot came up, and I went back to view door 3L and 4L for any sign of a Fuel Leak Spray from the Left Engine. No Spray was observed. We accomplished the checklist for Fuel Imbalance again and notified Dispatch and Maintenance Control and gave them more data and discussed diverting into ZZZZ if the :30 fuel rate of difference exceeded 1,000 pounds. After the second re balancing the imbalance only increased to 1,100 pounds for the remainder of the flight. All other values and indications were consistent with the flight (totalizer/calculated/fuel reaming at touchdown/HOWGOZIT). We decided to not blindly follow the Fuel Leak checklist and shut down the engine for just the 1,000-pound limit, as all other values and indications were within tolerances and fuel remaining and the HOWGOZIT numbers were reflective of our flight plan. The fuel imbalance, fuel totalizer calculated values did not increase after the second re balancing. Flight landed uneventful at ZZZ. Gave Maintenance Control our thoughts on the fuel scavenge system as well as the fuel imbalance issue stopped after the main tank fuel dropped below 25,000 pounds.				B777 Captain reported an increasing fuel Imbalance in cruise. The flight crew monitored the observed fuel imbalance and elected to continue to the destination airport.

Fortunately every one was seated, the cabin was already mostly cleaned up. All passengers had their seat belts on. Aircraft weight was 733,000 lbs. M 0.82, FL300. We experienced momentary loss of aircraft control, significant airspeed fluctuations, including intermittent stick shaker. Several objects in the flight deck hit the ceiling, and significant pull on the seat belts. I came close to hitting my head on the control wheel from a sitting position. No aircraft limitations were exceeded, speed or bank limits.Fortunately, there were no injuries, and the aircraft did not seem to be damaged. The cabin was also intact, no damage other than some spilled drinks and broken glasses. After informing dispatch of our situation, and announcing the encounter on frequency, we determined it was safe to continue to ZZZZ We did consider a divert back to ZZZ, or possibly ZZZ1, but decided it was safe to continue. Dispatches first reaction was very disappointing. He asked us a couple of times if it was really severe turbulence, and asked us to read the manual's definition of severe, like he didn't believe us. Got essentially the same message from Maintenance Control, was it really severe? Yes, unequivocally. In XX years of flying, I have never experienced severe turbulence till this flight. There was never a question about the integrity of the plane, just got the plane really beat up. The radar was on, no weather was observed. Clear air turbulence, unforecast. No suggestions.We did have 1 PIREP from an A330 further N on the ZZZ1 tracks also experienced severe turbulence, but it was not near our route of flight. In the end, I was disappointed of dispatches response, as well as maintenance. It was like they really didn't want us to use the severe turbulence descriptor, because the inspection it triggers. Not the response I was hoping for. Not, is everyone ok, or is the plane ok. But was it really severe?				B777 Captain reported momentary loss of aircraft control after experiencing severe turbulence at cruise altitude.

I immediately took manual control of the aircraft and assessed the cause finding the left TRANSFER BUS OFF Annunciation accompanied by the Left SOURCE OFF Annunciation Illuminated. My copilot went to the QRH and we ran the TRANSFER BUS OFF checklist without success of regaining power to the associated bus. The procedure in this situation directs the pilots to land at the nearest suitable airport which in this case was our destination airport ZZZ. We [requested priority handling] and proceeded to ZZZ. The NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS checklist was also run and the SOURCE OFF checklist was reviewed. Inside the final fix landing Runway XXL the smell of potential burning electrical became apparent. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was requested to be present on landing and the Flight Attendants were asked about the condition in the cabin where no smell was detected.The landing was uneventful and ARFF followed us to the gate as a precaution. We also directed the ground crew to stay away from the aircraft until ARFF had determined there were no hot spots within the aircraft. The Flight Attendant additionally reported after deplaning at the gate in ZZZ that earlier in the flight an oven had smelled of burning plastic and then shut off. This would have happened approximately one hour before the bus off event and was also reported to Maintenance. The crew did an excellent job of managing this mechanical event and maintaining passenger care throughout. When running the NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS checklist I decided not to inform the Flight Attendants or the passengers of the situation as we were landing at our destination airport and no further assistance was anticipated. In hindsight I feel informing the Flight Attendants would have been prudent regardless of the fact a diversion was not required.				B737-800 Captain reported on initial descent, the Autopilot Disengaged in smooth air without warning and they could smell potential burning electrical equipment. The flight crew continued destination airport and landed.

Had the First Officer mentioned that he had seen the Gear Pins, this would not have happened. Had the tampers spoken up, this would not have happened.		After takeoff, Gear would not Retract. Apparently, Maintenance had left Main Gear Pins in place and that prevented Gear Retraction. Gear Pins must be checked by Maintenance, Push Crew and Pilots.		B737-800 flight crew reported Landing Gear would not retract after takeoff when the Gear Handle was move to the up position. The flight crew made an air turn back and landing at departure airport.

Rotate required maybe twice the normal elevator force. Normal climb-out. Not certain of any excess pitch forces during climb. After takeoff, climb, and cruise, aircraft responded well to manual pitch, electric trim, and autopilot use. No other abnormal system indications. Takeoff trim setting seemed typical for aircraft weight. During preflight I had read electronic aircraft logbook entry, Day 0, stating controls were heavy during takeoff rotation and during landing flare. Maintenance corrective action mentioned a loose union at elevator feel computer pitot line - corrected.My initial thought was to continue to ZZZZ and see how the landing flare felt at normal landing weight, as the aircraft seemed to be operating normally - other than takeoff rotation. I intended to, at a minimum, write up the excess elevator force required during rotate upon arrival in ZZZZ. FO (First Officer) supported that course of action. I also discussed the possibility that an incorrect CG calculation might have the same effect. I reviewed the Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls Checklist which ends at Step 7 if controls are operating normally, allowing for continued flight, which they appeared to be. If however, the aircraft would later exhibit abnormal elevator forces, during speed and configuration changes required for approach / landing, a flaps 15 landing would be required. This would not be a prudent landing configuration at ZZZZ, with potential wet runway considerations. Given the above maintenance history, I decided the most prudent course of action was to discontinue flight by returning to ZZZ. I requested priority handling, landed flaps 15, approximately 10,000 lb. overweight at ZZZ, [Runway] XXL, 13,000+ ft. of runway, using max reverse to slow considerably before manual brake application - autobrakes not used. Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls, Overweight Landing, Non-Routine Landing, and all normal checklists were completed. No abnormal elevator forces were felt during remainder of flight. Soft landing, routine taxi to gate. Normal brake temperatures reported by ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) Chief after gate arrival.				B737-800 Captain reported rotation on takeoff required approximately twice the normal elevator force, and opted to perform an air turnback.

Maintenance believed the problem was fixed and cycled flaps multiple times on the ground. After departing a second time and climbing out and accelerating on the ZZZZZ climb schedule, I called for flaps up from the flaps one position and we received another flaps drive malfunction indication on the EICAS - previously having just gone through this issue and briefing on the ground as to what we would do if it happened again. We asked for a level-off altitude and vectors back around for another approach. Captain ran the QRH and after completion took controls for the landing. We did not declare an emergency with ATC after being prompted and asked repeatedly if we wanted to do so with Approach. We did have them roll the firetrucks as a precaution for potential hot brakes with the faster approach and touchdown speed with not having landing flaps available. We landed uneventfully and after checking brake temperature we told ATC that we had all normal conditions and taxied back into our assigned parking bay. Cause -  Flap Drive malfunction.		On climb-out as the aircraft was accelerating on ZZZZZ climb schedule, called for flaps up from the flap one position and got a flaps drive EICAS message. Captain asked ATC for a level-off altitude and a heading to the east to troubleshoot. Altitude given was the one we were passing on climb-out, so [we] had to level off and go back down to it. Captain explained the situation to ATC and began to run QRH. After running QRH, the Captain took control of the aircraft and had me back them up on having everything done and on landing data. I agreed on their decision to turn back to ZZZ. We asked ATC for an approach to the longest runway and to have the firetrucks standing by for a potential hot brakes situation with the faster approach speed. Landing was uneventful and after checking brake temperatures we told ATC everything was normal and taxied back in. Cause - Flap Drive malfunction.		B777-200 flight crew reported a Flap Drive failure occurred after retracting the flaps during the initial climb. The flight crew then elected to perform an air turnback. This was the second air turnback for this aircraft after a previous departure also prompted the same system failure.

Conferenced in dispatcher/maintenance, determined the flaps drive was a computer anomaly, as it was no longer present. Determined the asymmetry was not a likely cause, we extended flaps to 20 using the flap alternate extension. Coordinated with ATC for a return to ZZZ for an ILS using CAT2 auto land procedures. Wx was low IFR barely CAT 1 with 60M ceilings. Landed uneventfully with Crash Fire Rescue standing by. We had plenty of fuel for an air turn back to ZZZ so we had time to coordinate and troubleshoot prior to landing. Aircraft was previously written up for a flap drive malfunction. The problem migrated from flap drive to flap/slat control after fix. Could be a faulty flap computer making repair difficult. Consolation with Boeing may be required to fix the actual problem or problems.				B777 Captain reported a failure of the flaps to retract after takeoff. After consulting maintenance, the crew used an alternate flap extension procedure and returned to the departure airport for maintenance.

They - 747 - were cleared to descend via in front of us approximately 10 miles ahead. The winds aloft were mostly a headwind around 30 - 40 kt. The flight was smooth across the Gulf of Mexico, seatbelt sign was off. During the descent we encountered a light turbulent airframe vibration lasting 15 - 30 seconds, followed by the yoke displacing 30+ degrees to the right, at which point the autopilot disconnected and we got an oral roll authority message. The First Officer observed the yoke movement, and took control as soon as the autopilot disconnected. The aircraft rolled slightly to the left. The First Officer took control of the aircraft and turned 10 to 15 left into the wind to escape the wake turbulence. I, the pilot monitoring, and Captain notified ATC of the wake turbulence and told them we would need to offset 1 to 2 miles behind the heavy. I immediately turned on the seatbelt sign and made a PA. I checked with the flight attendants after we were clear of the wake. No issues in the cabin were noted. During cruise we observed the heavy 747 contrail ahead of us, and I relayed a story of a previous wake turbulence encounter in light winds, so we had some anticipation of the wake effects and responded immediately and appropriately.

FO (First Officer) cleared right, I cleared left visually and verbalized, turned appropriate lights on, and intentionally did not disarm speed brakes to prevent FO from being distracted with after-landing flow. As we crossed the hold bars and I gained a better perspective to our right, of potential traffic on [Runway] XXR, Tower told us to hold position and I nearly simultaneously saw an aircraft approaching, potentially taking off, on [Runway] XXR. We of course immediately stopped. I quickly thought about reversing, but we had one reverser inoperative, and although across the hold bars, we were clear of the actual runway surface. Also, the departing aircraft was a narrow body, so geometrically a collision shouldn't occur. After the departing aircraft became airborne, Tower cleared us to cross again, and we confirmed they had initially cleared us to cross, which they confirmed.		Aircraft X. Upon landing on Runway XXL, we exited the runway at Taxiway 1 and were instructed by ATC to hold short [Runway] XXR at [Taxiway] 3. We did. Shortly after, ATC cleared us to cross [Runway] XXR at [Taxiway] 3. Both the Captain and I looked to make sure the runway was clear. On my side, I saw the lights of an aircraft at the end of the runway that appeared to be waiting - line up and wait. We started moving forward slowly at that time. Then I saw the aircraft appear to be moving, and at the same time, the controller told us to stop. By this time, we were past the hold-short line, but still short of the runway edge line. Too close for comfort, however. The departing aircraft lifted off prior to our intersection. Shortly after, ATC cleared us a second time to cross. I clarified with them that they cleared us to cross previously and they confirmed 'yes.' After that, we taxied to the gate uneventfully.		A320 flight crew reported a critical ground conflict while taxiing to the gate. ATC cleared the flight crew to cross but there was another aircraft that was taking off on the runway prior to the intersection.

Myself and another relief pilot were the relief pilots for the segment and in occupied the cockpit jumpseats during the event. On liftoff, R DRIVE and R GEN OFF illuminated. Captain acknowledged the message and calmly stated for the student to complete a normal takeoff profile and we would address the messages on climb out - an excellent decision and use of CRM. Once safely established on climb out, Captain started the APU (experience showing here) and was in the process to address the R side generator messages via checklist but the system RESET itself and all R side messages disappeared. A few short minutes later, the L DRIVE and L GEN OFF illuminated. Captain indicated this was unusual and it was likely we may need to return to ZZZZ. We began the process coordinating a hold with ATC to allow for proper system evaluation and checklist use as well as coordination with Dispatch & Maintenance. Established in the hold, Captain used the checklist - the Left side electrical messages persisted and, as a result, the L IDG DRIVE was disconnected via checklist command. After coordination with Company, we were informed that Maintenance independently received IDG/ GEN related messages on BOTH the right side as well as the left side generator systems - though we only had left side indications persist. Again, Captain's instincts proved correct. Captain, in agreement with the Dispatcher and pilot flight crew, came to the universal decision the safest course of action was a return to ZZZZ for inspection. Next Captain coordinated with ATC to provide for fuel dumping and the fuel dump checklist was actioned and, later, the overweight landing checklist was actioned. Captain coordinated with the flight attendants and informed the passengers of the return to ZZZZ. The IOE student had decent previous experience and was able to program the FMC and manage airspeed & configuration changes showing a high level of situational awareness. Captain delegated to the both relief pilots to verify landing performance and double check the diversion guidance from the flight manual. A normal approach and landing was made into ZZZZ and all appropriate electrical maintenance write-ups were completed. Having myself been an instructor in the regional airlines, I must add the calm manner of Captain allowed the student to excel in this environment and despite multiple EICAS messages - the flight was conducted in a deliberate, methodical, and safe fashion based on the leadership of Captain - an outstanding job.		Right after takeoff, we had the R GEN OFF and R GEN DRIVE EICAS messages along with the associated lights on the overhead panel. Just as we were going to do the checklist procedure, the R GEN DRIVE message and light cleared. The right generator was reset by checklist procedure and continued to operate normally.A few minutes later, the L GEN OFF and L GEN DRIVE EICAS messages along with the associated lights on the overhead panel came on. Followed flight manual guidance and did the associated checklist, which disconnects the IDG. Requested clearance from ATC to proceed to a waypoint and hold while we discussed the situation with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. We all agreed that the most prudent course of action would be a return to ZZZZ. Jettisoned fuel and returned for an overweight landing. Dispatch was notified of the use of Emergency Authority for the overweight landing. Provided Dispatch with the fuel jettison data.		B777 flight crew reported a mechanical problem with both engine generators during climb. The flight crew returned to the departure airport for an overweight landing.

I called the Flight Attendants and told them I would be handing the Fire Extinguisher back to them and to find a safe place to put it. The #1 Flight Attendant (FA) put it into an empty service cart in the forward galley. We were concerned about a halon release but it was obvious there was none. After 6 minutes we removed the oxygen masks one at a time and did a self assessment. We both felt fine and there was no odor so we continued to destination. I believe the collar seal on the extinguisher was old. The FO inspected the seal after it failed and said it looked old. Emphasize to inspectors to look for seal wear. Also pay particular attention to the seal condition on the preflight.				B737-800 Captain reported the cockpit fire extinguisher failed at cruise causing a loud bang in the cockpit and releasing CO2. The flight crew went on oxygen and passed the fire extinguisher back to the flight attendants for storage. The flight continued to destination airport.

I had felt fluttering and jerky roll/yaw but thought it may be due to the Captain's flying style or turbulence. The Captain asked me to fly and feel the controls, at which point we transferred the flight controls and I felt the same phenomenon even while no inputs were being made to any flight control surface. After deliberation, it was decided to return to ZZZ due to this being a flight control issue. We completed the 'Elevator Tab Vibration' QRH since it's stated in the notes that the Vibration may be felt in any flight control, including the Rudder. We landed, the fire department completed an external inspection and we taxied to the gate where the aircraft was taken out of service.		Upon departure, right turn initiated and rudder response not smooth. Rudder felt it had dead space either side of neutral then would engage with a grabbing sensation and yaw the aircraft slightly. Captain (CA) was pilot flying and hand flying, turned aircraft over to First Officer (FO). FO reported same sensation. CA called aft Flight Attendants (FAs) on intercom and they stated a vibration in tail was felt. CA and FO mutually agreed to return to field. Ran trim vibration QRH checklist. Uneventful approach, landing and return to gate [at] ZZZ.		B737-800 flight crew reported a flight control flutter and airframe vibration after takeoff. The flight crew conferred with the cabin crew who confirmed the vibration and then returned to the departure airport for a precautionary landing.

And cleared left turn on course after T/O. I, the First Officer (FO) was the Pilot Flying and was still hand flying. A left turn was made and we continued our climb. As I leveled the turn I was cross referencing the instruments and visuals when I looked and saw a flock of geese 12 o'clock. I yelled out birds. The geese where unavoidable and we impacted within seconds of me calling them out. Damage to Engine #1 was apparent as the vibrations it was putting out where extremely high. And you could feel it throughout the airframe. The Captain selected the Fuel Control Unit (FCU) ALT of 4,000 feet and a decision to return to ZZZ was made as we didn't know the extend of airframe damage that had occurred. I started a decent and left turn for a downwind back to Runway XX. The Captain alerted the Flight Attendants of the situation and advised ATC. The Captain ran the overweight landing checklist. The secondary flight plan was then activated and the ILSXX was already programmed by me on the preflight so I set the airplane up for a base and intercepted the localizer coming back to ZZZ Runway XX. A visual approach was flown and a smooth landing was done for the overweight procedure. We then taxied to the gate and deplaned as normal and resumed normal ops. Upon deplaning we inspected engine #1 to find serious blade and engine damage.				A320 First Officer reported a bird strike shortly after takeoff. Geese were observed striking the aircraft and the number one engine resulting in heavy vibrations and severe damage to the engine. The crew returned to the departure airport.

While First Officer (FO) Person A continued to fly the aircraft, I took care of the ECAM. No action items were displayed and I referenced non normals page for further guidance. The FM (Flight Manual) only indicated that we had to monitor the air data information if standby instruments were used. Our maintenance history showed that this was a repeat write up and I proceeded to send a maintenance request code through ACARS. The ECAM was cleared and the screens were normal.We initiated our descent into ZZZ with Autopilot2 engaged west of the ZZZ1 VOR when we received another ECAM, this time for a L/G Shock Absorber Fault. Before we could even address that, we received the Autopilot Disconnect Warning Tone, an Auto Thrust Lock ECAM, and both Flight Directors (FDs) failed. We regained manual control of the throttles and FO continued to fly with the flight path vector selected and leveled off at FL220. We attempted to reengage the Autopilot, Auto Throttles and Flight Directors to no avail. All Flight mode Annunciators (FMAs) on both of our Primary Flight Displays (PFDs) were blank except for the barometric minimums altitude for the RNAV XXL approach to ZZZ we had previously selected. Our Navigation Display (ND) displays still showed a course line, the Multipurpose Control Display Unit (MCDUs) still had all of the navigation information displayed and our PFDs still showed accurate attitude, altitude, heading and airspeed indications as cross referenced with our standby instruments. GPWS terrain information was not available. FO continued to fly the aircraft while I performed the FMGC Dual Failure procedure. Since the FMGCs did not recover we attempted the short FMGC reset with no effect. An ARINC three-way call was set up with Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss our plan of action since our approach capability was limited to raw data ILS and visual approaches. The only ILS available at ZZZ was for Runway XYR and the winds were out of the southeast at 16 kts. so that was out of the question. The weather in ZZZ2 was also questionable with low ceilings and strong cross winds. ZZZ3 was VFR so we agreed to divert there. We advised ZZZ Center. They were advised of our situation and radar vectors were provided to ZZZ3. I briefed our Purser with the aircraft situation, our diversion plans, how long we had before landing and our after landing plans. I then made an announcement to the Passengers making them aware of our situation. Dispatch soon provided all landing data for Runways XZR and XAL at ZZZ3 through ACARS.Half way to ZZZ3 we regained both of our FMGCs, FDs, Autopilot and Auto Thrust. All systems were re-engaged while we actively monitored for possible failures. Vectors were provided for the visual approach to Runway XZR at ZZZ3, the Auto Throttles and Autopilot were disconnected and the approach and landing were flown uneventfully. Taxi to gate number XX was also uneventful and after parking, a full verbal debrief was conducted with our waiting Mechanics.		[Report narrative contained no additional information.]		A320 flight crew reported experiencing multiples system failures and ECAM warnings during cruise. After running through the appropriate checklists the crew diverted for a safe landing.

We knew there would be moderate turbulence in the area and experienced at least occasional moderate on our descent below 16,000 ft. There were clouds in the area that indicated moderate turbulence and passed through a portion of them on our descent at about 16,000 ft. This turbulence was greater-than-moderate. Maybe not quite severe, but as you'll see we did not want to go back through them again. We were given a visual approach to Runway XXL and experienced moderate turbulence on the approach.In the flare the main wheels barely touched down, and we got a gust that picked us back up. After realizing the landing could not be made safely, we accomplished a normal go-around. On the go around we were given a climb to 11,000 ft. and a heading of 170. We complied with these instructions. Then as we were still cleaning up the airplane, ATC gave us a left turn to a heading of 070. Turbulence at the time was moderate and just bordering on, but not quite, severe. We told ATC that we wanted to maintain our heading and climb as the vector would have put us directly in the nearly severe turbulence in the clouds we flew through descending into ZZZ. The conditions were VMC on the west side of those clouds and we monitored clearance from the terrain.ATC gave us another easterly heading which, again, would have taken us through possibly severe turbulence; and we asked to maintain heading and climb above the turbulence so we could evaluate fuel and whether another approach could be made. Maintaining terrain clearance and using Captain's emergency authority, I elected to maintain heading and we told ATC we could not comply with the turn and requested a climb. ATC gave further instructions which we complied with that didn't require a heading into the turbulence, but no further climb was given.I assessed our fuel and made a decision at that time to divert to our alternate of ZZZ2. We requested the diversion. We were given a heading and altitude toward ZZZ2 and proceeded and landed.En route we were given a number to call for a 'possible deviation.' We acknowledged the number and landed without incident at ZZZ2.I probably should have declared an emergency for fuel. In hindsight ATC was probably vectoring us back for another approach. We were still evaluating whether that was possible. But ATC, I think, misunderstood our request to stay out of potentially severe turbulence. Better communication between us and ATC might have helped the situation. ATC's intent to keep us in their airspace while try to vector us back and our intent to avoid severe turbulence (while maintaining terrain clearance) and evaluate whether a return was possible conflicted.		ZZZ1 to ZZZ for visual, Runway XXL. For context: 1) I'm on Day 2 out of IOE. I know where information is available to me in the flight deck, but my scan is not innate, yet. As much as I'd like to have better numbers for what the winds were doing at each spot and exactly what our assigned headings and altitudes were, I'm just not there, yet. I'm very much using conscious brainpower to gather and process info. 2) On our way into ZZZ, we were vectored north along the eastern edge of a mountain ridge southeast of the city and clipped the easternmost edge of the clouds over those peaks. There was immediate moderate turbulence (closer to severe than light) just clipping the edge of those clouds. I'll call them the 'turbulent clouds.' At the time, they looked like a collection of several merged cumulous clouds. We were warned of gains/losses of airspeed 10-15 kts. by PIREPS in front of us and the crosswinds were pretty strong from west-to-east. Just about at touchdown, we got a gust of wind and the Captain executed a 'go-around.' We climbed out in VMC, on runway heading, roughly following the southbound valley that the interstate follows. We had unlimited visibility along our path to the south and clear awareness of the terrain on both sides. Departure gave us a level off at 11,000 ft., which ended up being right in moderate (nearly severe) turbulence as we were level with the mountain peaks to our west (only a couple miles away), and downwind of the west-to-east winds. I asked for an immediate climb to get out of the turbulence, and the controller issued it with a turn to the east, directly towards the turbulent clouds over the city.I informed the Controller we were unable the turn to the east because of the weather, at which point he stated we were below MVA and needed to turn in order for him to climb us. After a couple of radio exchanges, it was clear we only had to climb 100 ft. on an easterly heading before we could request a turn to the south again, so we attempted that. Ultimately, we ended up on a 170 heading and climbed above the turbulence (though I tried to get further to the right/west because we were brushing right up against the turbulent clouds). Somewhere in the exchanges, Departure did ask for our intentions; and I let them know we wanted to continue south for about 10 more miles. At the time, that was to get around the turbulent clouds and give us time to analyze/discuss our next decisions (try again or divert). Ultimately, the Captain decided we needed to divert because of our fuel state, and that process went smoothly. This was a very compressed timeline with highs winds, terrain, and turbulence, and a challenging mental model to share with the Controller who couldn't see or experience what we could. I was confident then, and now, that the safest actions we needed take at that time were to continue climbing out of the turbulence in the direction where we had great visibility and terrain clearance, while NOT turning directly into the heart of the clouds to our east that we already knew had strong, moderate turbulence on its fringes. Of note, on our return flight from ZZZ2 to ZZZ about two hours later, the clouds over the city appeared as a collection of several standing lenticular clouds, interconnected along the spine of the mountains underneath them.The only options I can think of that would have allowed us to continue with our own terrain clearance and climb in VMC would have been to declare an emergency or cancel IFR for two minutes then pick it back up. I don't know of an in-between way to concisely communicate to ATC that we were in a great spot to take responsibility for terrain clearance while on a south ground track that would avoid the turbulent clouds. I think the Controller was trying to vector us back for another approach and/or shortest direction back into an area where we would be above the MVA. If there's a way to relieve the Controller of his/her terrain clearance responsibility without saying 'emergency' or 'cancel,' I don't know what it is. It would have been nice to be able to say something like, 'We got terrain clearance, continuing 180, climbing to ___ (assigned), let us know when you can turn us west to go to ZZZ2.		B737-700 Flight Crew reported moderate turbulence during the final approach resulting in a go around in which ATC assigned an unsuitable heading due to weather and terrain restrictions. Captain invoked Captain's authority to maintain heading and altitude clearance and also requested clearance to the alternate airport.

While completing the After Takeoff Checklist, my First Officer (FO) called my attention to a FUEL IMBAL indication on fuel quantity indicator. The left main tank was indicating about 1,000 pounds less than the right main tank and we were also burning center tank fuel. Having taken off with full mains and roughly 14,000 pounds in the center tank, we knew we should not be seeing an imbalance indication. I was hand flying at the time and called for the FUEL IMBALANCE CHECKLIST. As she was pulling up the checklist on the QRH, I tried engaging the Autopilot on CMD A so I could transfer control and run the checklist. It didn't engage so I continued to hand fly and had her run the checklist. The fuel level rate decrease in the left main was alarming which led us to the FUEL LEAK ENGINE CHECKLIST. I tried re-engaging the Autopilot on CMD B which successfully engaged this time. I informed ATC of our situation and we may need to return to ZZZ. As per the checklist, we turned off the center tank fuel pumps and the fuel level rate decrease immediately slowed. I called the flight attendants to see if they noticed fuel spray out of the left engine/wing/pylon area. They called back and said no. The checklist led us to turning the center tank pumps back on. The engines seemed to be mostly burning out of the center tank however we noticed the left main began decreasing again, however this time at a much lower rate. I transferred aircraft control to the FO while I attempted to call Dispatch on the local ZZZ frequency. They didn't respond so I tried to call Maintenance to see if they was anything we could do. They offered no suggestions. The fuel level was still decreasing out of the left main. It was obvious we could not continue on to ZZZZ nor could we afford to burn fuel down to below max landing weight as the fuel imbalance was out of limits and worsening. I advised ATC and informed them of our need to return. I informed the flight attendants, passengers, and completed the non routine landing checklist, reprogrammed the FMS, and advised Dispatch via ACARS, computed landing performance. I took control of the airplane and we returned for an overweight landing. After clearing the runway, the Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles inspected the aircraft and saw no visible signs of a fuel leak. We taxied to the gate uneventfully.				B737-800 Captain reported a fuel imbalance indication during climb out and the need to return to the departure airport.

Reported proceeding 757 in sight and cleared to visual approach. When cleared visual approach, we were 4 miles behind the 757 according to TCAS. Previous Controller had assigned 210 kts; but when we were cleared visual approach, no airspeed was assigned by the new Controller.As we intercepted final, TCAS indicated that our range to the B757 had begun to decrease. Not wanting to get into wake turbulence, we began slowing to stabilize the distance. We slowed to 180 kts. About a minute later, Atlanta Approach queried us on our speed and admonished us that we needed to maintain our airspeed until directed, and then issued us a speed of 180 kts until the final approach fix, which we complied with.By the time we configured at the final approach fix, our distance to the 757 was just under 3 miles. Winds were reported as 090/8G14. Approach was normal until approximately 300 [ft.] when we encountered a sudden increased airspeed (15 kts) and then a sudden sink rate, which caused a 'SINK RATE, SINK RATE' caution. Immediate action was taken to correct both the airspeed deviation and the sink rate. Landing was normal.We debriefed this event. Both pilots agreed our understanding was that when cleared visual approach, unless specifically given an airspeed to follow, we were cleared to maneuver the aircraft at our discretion. No airspeed restriction was given to us and our speed reduction was in response to the aircraft preceding us. Even with just under three-mile spacing, we encountered wake turbulence that resulted in a speed excursion and a sink rate caution. Approach Control needs to issue speed restrictions on a visual approach if they are required. We also need to ensure proper separation from heavy aircraft. The 757 was not using a heavy callsign; however, we still encountered wake turbulence.		On vector to join localizer to Runway 8L in ATL at assigned speed of 210 [kts], we reported preceding 757 traffic in sight and were cleared the visual approach with no airspeed assigned. I mentioned to the Captain that 757's have the most extreme wake turbulence. He suggested I slow, which I did, to 190 [kts] as we were approximately four miles behind the 757. Atlanta Approach called to assign 180 [kts] until the final approach fix and asked if we had already slowed. We told them we had. They responded not to slow until told to do so and not to do it again, but no harm this time. When we slowed from 180 [kts] to landing speed at the final approach fix, we had closed to approximately three miles from the 757. Wind reported with landing clearance had an unplanned gust (090/8G14). On short final, I noticed airspeed rapidly increasing to plus 15 kts and pulled thrust back. As I added thrust to capture landing airspeed, we got the automated sink rate caution. I adjusted aim point slightly, to account for the sink rate since thrust was already coming back in. Crossing the runway threshold, airspeed was stable within 10 kts of target and sink rate was commensurate with a normal approach. Landing was normal.		Air carrier B737-800 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence just before landing in ATL in trail of a B757 that resulted in airspeed and sink rate deviations.

I asked them if it was a cigarette smell. They said no, it smelled like burning plastic. They said no one was experiencing breathing issues and there was no visible smoke. I informed the Captain. We decided to [request priority handling], in order to attain traffic priority and get on the ground ASAP, in case the situation deteriorated, ensure Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles could inspect the aircraft immediately upon landing, and to be present for an immediate response in case the situation did worsen. ATC gave us an immediate turn to a dog leg to final, cleared us for the visual approach to Runway XXC and told us speed was our discretion. While this was going on, the FA's were updating us on the situation in the aft cabin. They said the alarm had gone out. They also mentioned that they suspected that it was the hot water heater and that they had removed power from it. However, they were not sure what the source of the fumes was and that it was a heavy plastic/electric burning smell though no one was having difficulty breathing. The Captain and I quickly discussed donning oxygen masks and goggles. Neither one of us saw any smoke nor smelled any kind of burning. Given that we were less than five minutes from landing and needed to slow down, configure, and get stabilized for the approach and that we were trying to communicate with the FAs, ATC, and each other, we decided that the safer course of action was to not don oxygen masks or goggles as per the smoke, fire, or fumes checklist. We asked the FAs to update us immediately, if the situation worsened. We landed, cleared the runway, and had fire/rescue inspect the aircraft. They detected no heat signature. We then ran the below-the-line items for the checklist and requested crash/rescue escort us back to the gate in case whatever caused the fumes (we still weren't sure exactly what was going on) turned into a full-fledged fire. We got to the gate. Personnel from the fire department boarded the aircraft and inspected the aft portion of the cabin and could not detect the source of the fumes nor any heat signature but did smell the heavy plastic/electric burning smell. After they'd made their way to the back of the aircraft, we allowed the passengers to begin deplaning. Afterward, contract maintenance inspected the aft lav and told me the hot water heater was the source of the fumes. This wouldn't prevent it from happening again, but I think it would be helpful if the checklist contained a note directing us to the section in the case of a lavatory smoke detector activation, though I don't know that we would've done anything differently even if that were the case because we we weren't 100% sure this was a lavatory fire issue until after the Maintenance Tech told us that, after the fact.				B737-800 First Officer reported a call from the aft flight attendants stating that smoke and fumes were present in the aft lavatory area with a lavatory smoke detector activated. The flight attendants isolated the lavatory water heater and removed power to it and the smoke and fumes dissipated. The flight crew continued to destination.

As we approached the taxiway, I kicked off the auto brakes and there was no braking. The aircraft started to weather vane into the wind and I felt the main gear skidding. I released the brakes and tracked the center line to exit at taxiway x. When we contacted Ground, we reported poor braking action on Runway XXR. Ground Control closed the runway for inspection after we cleared the runway. After we left the airplane, and were walking up the jet bridge to the terminal, one of the mechanics reported that several tires had flat spots and were out of limits. Spoke to the FAA and confirmed that the aircraft did not exit the pavement, and they said they would release the aircraft so maintenance could work on the airplane. Spoke to the Chief Pilot briefly about the event. Notified my fellow crew members that the Chief Pilot requested an report and that we should fill out reports.		We were told by a Mechanic as we deplaned that there was tire damage that likely occurred during landing rollout. The approach was typical for ZZZZ Runway XXR. The weather was overcast with rain and a moderate crosswind. The last wind check from the Tower was 180 at 15 if I recall correctly. The landing was normal. The auto brakes were set to 3 and we landed with flaps 25. The auto brakes engaged normally and the deceleration rate was appropriate to make an exit at the taxiway. The Captain disengaged the auto brakes by increasing the braking and at that time the plane began to weather vane and I felt a slight shudder with a noticeable decrease in braking rate. The Captain stated that the braking action was poor. The weather vane stopped as the Captain released the brakes and we continued down to the taxiway to exit the runway. I reported to Tower that the braking action on the far end of the runway was poor. This was likely due to the rain on top of rubber deposits on the runway. There was a vehicle already holding short of the runway when we landed and there was no traffic to follow us for landing. The runway was closed after our landing. The vehicle was there to do a runway inspection for debris on the runway and had specifically mentioned 'rubber'. We were not advised of any runway condition issues on our approach. The vehicle came off the runway around mid length after we taxied by and then proceeded the opposite direction down the taxiway to do an inspection from the rollout end of the runway. The taxi to the gate was normal. As previously stated, we were informed by a mechanic that 'several' tires had flat spots that were beyond limits. We are not sure how this occurred as even with manual braking the anti skid should have prevented tire lockup. I assume the damage occurred during the shudder we felt as the aircraft weather vaned. The weather vane was not dramatic--maybe a couple degrees of heading change at most.		B777 flight crew reported poor braking action after the Captain disconnected the auto brakes on landing rollout. The aircraft weathervaned with normal brake application and ceased when brakes were released. The aircraft slowed and control was regained. After arrival at the gate, the flight crew was informed by Maintenance that several main tires had flat spots and would require replacement.

The flight was dispatched with an inop ADR 3 (Air Data Reference) compliant with the aircraft's MEL, provided that IR1, IR 2, ADR 1, and ADR 2 are operative. They were. Shortly after take-off, we began receiving a stream of amber ECAM messages. Messages included VENT Blower Fault, NAV ADR 3 Fault, AUTO FLT AP OFF, and other navigation-related faults. After complying with ECAM procedures, and troubleshooting, we determined that we could not recover the autopilot. As the autopilot is required for RVSM operations, and as we planned to climb to FL390, we realized that we would have insufficient fuel reserves at ZZZ1 flying at FL270 with the higher fuel burn. We elected to return to our point of origin, ZZZ1, for repairs. While descending into the ZZZ2 airspace, we were aware of significant VFR traffic at ZZZ3 and other VFR aircraft operating in the local area. When we requested vectors and a descent for landing at ZZZ2, ZZZ Approach Control advised us that our dispatcher requested we divert to ZZZ. In what appeared to us to be an encouraging tone of voice, the Controller asked if we were requesting priority handling. We affirmed, provided fuel and souls on board, and stated that we would not need Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) equipment standing by and that our problem was multiple indications of failures of secondary systems, and that our return to ZZZ was driven by the fuel problem that resulted from our technical inaccessibility of RVSM airspace. The landing at ZZZ was otherwise normal and uneventful. In debriefing this flight, we concluded that the multiple issues we encountered seemed to stem from the inoperative ADR 3.				A320 First Officer reported encountering navigation system failures after departure that would preclude RVSM operations and there was insufficient fuel to complete the flight. The flight crew diverted to another airport and made a normal landing.

Both red and green lights illuminated and stayed illuminated as we ran through the QRH [for] gear disagree.		Aircraft X, ZZZ to ZZZ1 diverted to ZZZ2 for landing gear problems. During the climb-out of ZZZ on the ZZZZZ ZZZZZ1 SID, we noticed the left main landing gear, red light and green light, stayed illuminated with the landing gear handle in the up position, and then in the off position. No other landing gear lights were illuminated. The First Officer was the pilot flying. I consulted the QRH Gear Disagree Checklist items. We ran the checklist to its completion to no avail as the lights stayed illuminated. As we were climbing out, we kept our air speed at approximately 250 kt. Using our training and the CRM techniques, we discussed all possible actions to rectify the situation or execute a return to ZZZ or a diversion to ZZZ2 primarily due to the maintenance, the long runways, and the weather - ZZZ1 required an alternate.We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control through the ARINC frequencies in order to fix the landing gear issue and formulate a plan moving forward. Maintenance Control reminded us to go through the checklist again to rectify the problem. Once again, the lights stayed illuminated. In conjunction with Dispatch, we determined a diversion to ZZZ2 was the safest course of action. We informed ATC of our situation, then [requested priority handling], and diverted to ZZZ1. We also informed all three flight attendants of the situation and our diversion plan. We use the diversion checklist in the cockpit. We also calmly made a PA to the passengers that due to a mechanical issue, we would be diverting to ZZZ1. We had XX passengers onboard. We discussed all contingencies amongst the Captain and the First Officer. Possibly a low approach so the Tower could see if our landing gear was down. Also, the potential for a landing gear collapse on landing. Fire Rescue was standing by at our request.We discussed with the flight attendants, the remote possibility of a landing gear collapse, and potential evacuation, and to review their procedures if they needed to. On the final ILS approach to Runway XX Left, I put the gear down early to leave us time to make good decisions pertaining to a possible go-around - we had plenty of fuel. Once the landing gear was down, we had three solid green lights illuminated. We confirmed it with the overhead panel landing gear lights. The left main red landing gear light extinguished. We were confident our landing gear was down and locked and this was confirmed by the Control Tower. As the Captain and the pilot flying for this portion of the flight, I made a smooth landing within the 1,000 ft. to 1,500 ft. runway markings. We did a flaps 30, autobrakes two light weight landing and exited at [Taxiway] XX. The Fire Department did not detect any issues of smoke, fire, or hot brakes. We discussed having Maintenance come out and pin the gear, but we determined there were no further mechanical issues, so we taxied to Gate XX to write up the aircraft, turn it over to Maintenance, and debrief Dispatch, Maintenance, and the Company Operations Center Chief Pilot and ZZZ2 Fire/Operations. We also talked with our flight attendants to see what their condition was emotionally and if they were up to continuing with the trip. The support was above and beyond by ATC and all of Company Operations personnel, which was very helpful.		B737-700 Flight Crew reported the left main landing gear lights stayed illuminated despite the landing gear handle being in the up position. After consulting with Dispatch and Maintenance Control, the Flight Crew then decided to divert and safely landed at a suitable airport.

Descent brief noted the terrain in vicinity of the airport and points near final for the RNAV (GPS) XX. Winds were 280 at 13G20. First Officer (FO) was flying the approach. Vectors were to a left downwind, base and final. Configuration and checklists were as briefed. Approach mode was armed and the managed/managed V/DEV 'brick' was captured. The FO's approach was stabilized and he clicked off the autopilot and auto thrust at approximately 1,500 feet AGL. The gusty conditions made it a challenging approach, and at approximately 900 feet MSL I felt a slight sink due to the gusty winds. I glanced inside, noted the V/DEV was slightly above the horizon and then looked outside to see our PAPI indicators transitioning from 2 red/two white to three red. I verbally instructed the FO to level off and regain the two red and two white PAPIs. As he was accomplishing this, we heard/perceived a 'terrain ahead' Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) caution call out. My previous verbal instruction had him accomplishing the first step from the FM of adjusting the flight path. As I analyzed the situation for a possible go around or escape maneuver, it quickly resolved, we regained two red/two white PAPI indications and landed. We debriefed the flight, specifically talking about the terrain notification verbiage and I briefed approach techniques as the FO is inexperienced. I received a call from the FOQA gatekeeper and we debriefed the flight. He had additional information and his data showed us receiving a 'too low terrain' warning message but no 'pull up' command. The FO and I both do not recall hearing a 'too low terrain' nor 'pull up' command, which would have triggered us to accomplish the terrain escape maneuver.		On the RNAV XX approach into ZZZ, at approximately a 2-4 mile final, a GPWS 'Too Low Terrain' alert was annunciated. Auto pilot was off and as best as I can recall, the autothrust was off by that point. Upon hearing the GPWS, I shallowed out the descent and established 2 red, 2 white on the PAPI to continue the approach to land (the approach plate notes VGSI and RNAV glidepath not coincident). It was nighttime VMC with gusty winds.Captain and I debriefed that the vertical deviation brick on the approach was centered with minor deviations throughout the approach past the final approach fix. No excessive descent rate was indicated. No indication on the navigation display or Primary Flight Display indicated that terrain closure rate was excessive.We discussed that the approach plate indicates an elevation of 510 feet along the final approach course approximately 1-3 miles from the runway and a likely cause of the GPWS annunciation. We also debriefed that had the GPWS annunciated 'Terrain, Pull Up' an immediate escape maneuver would have been required. Given the fact it was nighttime, and a terrain alert was annunciated, I should have performed a go-around regardless of vertical deviation scale indications.At the time of submitting this report, Captain and I have both debriefed with an FOQA gate keeper discussing the events of the approach and agreed a safety report was warranted. Additionally, we both agree that in hindsight, a safety report was warranted immediately following the flight.		A320 flight crew reported receiving an EGPWS terrain warning while on an RNAV approach in windy conditions. The First Officer, per the Captain, was inexperienced and the aircraft briefly went below the glide-path. A normal landing was accomplished.

On climb out cockpit odor dissipated rapidly. However, flight attendants also reported smell in cabin, mostly towards rear of aircraft. As we continued, flight attendants reported odor had decreased in front, but less so in rear. Odor reported as a burnt marshmallow or slightly electrical smell.ATC was advised and return to ZZZ requested. Oxygen was used by cockpit crew. Over weight landing performed at ZZZ. Normal sink rate and smooth touchdown. At gate ZZZ CFR crew boarded aircraft with portable air quality sensing devices. Air reported normal, no VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) or other chemicals detected. Agent and firefighters reported electrical smell when aircraft door was opened. Neither passengers nor crew requested medical treatment. Logbook entry and App maintenance form completed.QRH smoke, fire, fume checklist quite cumbersome. We used aircraft odor procedure since smell was not irritating, but since odor couldn't be localized we were led back to Smoke, Fire, Fume procedure.		B737 flight crew reported fumes of unknown origin during climb. The flight crew performed an air turn back and landing at the departure airport.

We had to hurry and get fully configured and workload was high. After we passed ZZZZZ we forgot to put the MAP altitude in the altitude window due to the high workload. When we hit ZZZZZ1 the Flight Director (FD) directed a level off. We continued the approach visually and recognized we were getting low and leveled off. Due to the conflicting info from the FD, I switched to mental math to calculate the appropriate AGL for my descent while the Captain was trying to troubleshoot the FD so I could have accurate VNAV. At that point ZZZ Tower issued the low altitude alert and he told them correcting. I immediately leveled off as my VSI had increased a little more than the rule of thumb of GSx5 allowed. When we could see the PAPI we were slightly high and corrected and made an uneventful landing. Being more aware of the FAF and explicitly briefing it and directing the pilot monitoring (PM) to set the MAP altitude would have been key. Earlier configuration while keeping speed up would have allowed better workload management in terms of bleeding overtake. Continuing, in my opinion, was the right call as the workload at that moment to execute a go around would have caused confusion. Better configuration management. In that heavy airspace, configuring earlier than normal and keeping the thrust up to maintain speed is acceptable instead of trying to fly cleaner and faster longer. Better energy management. This is mainly an internal pilot flying thing for me to work on as someone who is still relatively new to the jet.		We set up for the ZZZZZ.4 arrival and the RNAV (GPS) X Runway XX approach. The First Officer (FO) (flying pilot (FP) and myself (pilot monitoring (PM) briefed the arrival and approach. The ZZZZZ.4 arrival was uneventful and eventually we were cleared for the RNAV GPS X Runway XX approach. We planned to have the aircraft fully configured by ZZZZZ1 which we were doing. As we were approaching ZZZZZ getting configured ZZZ Tower informed us the regional jet (RJ) in front of us had slowed down and we had a 40 kt. overtake on the RJ. We quickly finished configuring and slowing the aircraft approaching ZZZZZ1. Because we were distracted by the RJ slowing so early and us having to quickly configure and slow our aircraft we forgot to set in the missed approach (MAP) altitude passing ZZZZZ and before arriving at the MAP altitude.At ZZZZZ2 the Flight Director (FD) commanded a level off which surprised us initially. The FO/FP asked what was happening and I told him that we forgot to set the MAP altitude. I told him to continue flying the lateral portion of the approach visually and I would give him rates of descent to fly. I told him to initially fly a 750 (ft. per minute) FPM rate of descent (ROD). He started a ROD greater than that causing us to get low in altitude as we were making the turn to line up with the extended runway centerline after ZZZZZ2. I could see this developing from my previous experience flying this approach and told him to level off which he finally did. Approximately in the area of the ZZZZZ3 waypoint ZZZ Tower issued us a low altitude alert and to check our altitude. I replied to them that we were 'correcting.' As we came around on the turn to final approach we were slightly high and I told the FO to start a ROD of about 750 FPM and fly the PAPI to the runway which he did to an uneventful touch down and landing. Not emphasizing in the briefing the high event fate/occurrences on this approach caused by crews forgetting to set the MAP altitude after passing ZZZZZ2. I read it but failed to prominently mention it to the FO/FP. Not monitoring the spacing with the aircraft in front of us by using the TCAS display. Even though this is not necessarily legal to do or use it would have been a useful tool for our situational awareness (SA). Instead of not going around (GA) relying on my previous lengthy experience flying this approach to talk the FO through it rather than going around. My experience would help in a situation like this but the proper thing to have done in this situation would have been to GA when ZZZ Tower gave us the low altitude alert. Not giving a very thorough briefing about the MAP and what events could trigger us to perform the MAP.Even though I had read the note on the company pages about the high rate of events, that described our event perfectly, neither of us mentioned nor emphasized that possible error. That should have been a high priority part of our briefing. In hind sight we should have performed a go around (GA) with the low altitude alert. I was concerned about the very high workload for a GA from that approach and from my previous 30 years of experience performing approaches into Runway XX I felt that it was safer to continue the approach while talking the FO through the final turn to final approach. A better approach would have been to very thoroughly brief the MAP and what events would trigger us to perform a MAP.		Flight Crew reported the Flight Director commanded them to level off while conducting an RNAV approach due to failure to set the missed approach altitude. The crew continued the approach visually and became unstable resulting in a low altitude alert from the tower.

I immediately rotated the aircraft at Vr, dismissing the delayed rotation for the wind shear profile, since the aircraft was accelerating rapidly and consistently. The vibration stopped once airborne. At the time it seemed apparent that the nose gear or nose wheels were causing the vibration, however upon further assessment I was not sure which gear or wheel had caused the vibration. We cleaned up and climbed normally. ATC was giving us vectors to avoid the numerous thunderstorms in the area. My First Officer (FO) and I had a short discussion on what might have caused the vibration as we navigated around the storms. Once clear of the weather we immediately received a message from Dispatch that the Tower reported that we had blown a tire on take-off. After reviewing AOM, non normal landing on a flat tire, we discussed options and decided to continue to ZZZ1. This was the best option to burn off fuel with long dry runways at sea level. It was also an online Maintenance station and delivered our passengers to their destination. Returning to ZZZ was not an option due to the weather and wet runways. I contacted our Dispatcher via Company radio with the plan, asked them to [request priority handling], have the ZZZ1 station prepared for a possible tow to the gate, and to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) waiting upon our arrival. Our Dispatcher was in agreement with the plan. I briefed the Flight Attendants and passengers of the status of the aircraft and that we would experience a landing with possible vibrations during the roll out. I assured all that I was not concerned about the landing, but we would have ARFF vehicles standing by as an extra measure of safety and they could inspect the aircraft before we taxied to the gate. On approach I extended the gear early to assure proper function. The landing gear extended normally. However, we did not have a green left main gear safe light on the front panel but had all three green on the overhead panel. Having the left main green light out on the front panel confirmed that the vibration and tire/s failure was most likely on the left main gear.I asked the Tower to observe our landing gear on our approach. They confirmed that all landing gear appeared to be down. I landed normally with a flaps 40 setting for slower speed. Touchdown was soft and the aircraft settled with left wing low. I had to use the right rudder to keep the center line during deceleration. I used reverse thrust to slow the aircraft primarily then used light braking while using most of the runway to stop and not to stress the remaining tire unnecessarily. ARFF assessed the aircraft, and it was determined that it was safe to taxi to the gate. I had them follow us to the gate. The aircraft had lost the recap on the inboard left main gear tire, and I believe it was deflated as well. It damaged the flaps and sections on the wing. A part of the tire was in the wheel well which interfered with the landing gear indication system micro switches. I made a logbook entry and turned the aircraft over to Maintenance.

The release requested an APU inflight start. The APU failed to start on the previous verification flight. We determined we would not be able to complete the verification because our flight time was scheduled to be XA:26. During boarding and about 25 minutes to scheduled departure, Maintenance arrived at the airplane and said they had been directed to defer the APU. We reviewed and briefed the engine air start and cross-bleed start checklist, and briefed face to face with ramp personnel. During taxi out and after the cross-bleed start, we got zone temp lights for the CONT CABIN and FWD CABIN. We taxied to the holding pad to troubleshoot the zone temp lights with Maintenance. The decision was made to defer the primary channels of the zone temp controllers. After an uneventful take-off, the flaps retracted normally. During arrival to ZZZ, we noticed the primary left flap indicator needle was bouncing. We decided to configure the flaps early to ensure the flaps would function normally. We selected flaps 1, but the slats failed to extend. We verified the flap indication on the primary flap indicator and the secondary flap indicator on the aft overhead panel, but we did not have a LE TRANSIT light or a flaps 1 indication on the airspeed tape. We were on downwind for Runway XX to ZZZ and asked ATC for delayed vectors to troubleshoot the problem. We did not have a caution light but we had no slat indication on both flap indicators. We started with the flap transit checklist. The first bullet point states, 'One or more of these may occur: the leading edge devices are not in the commanded position.' Therefore, we determined this was the appropriate checklist. Step 3 of the checklist directs you to select flaps up then reselect flaps 1. After completing step 3 we still had no slat indications on the primary, secondary flap indicators or the airspeed tape, but we also still did not have a caution light or an flap transit light. Fuel was a concern so we set a timer for 10 minutes to further troubleshoot. The checklist does not address a no caution light with no flap indications. We attempted to call Maintenance and got a frequency from Dispatch. Dispatch also said we were probably too low for reception. When we got on the frequency it was occupied with another aircraft. ATC asked us if we were requesting priority handling and we told them to standby. They then said the company was requesting priority handling for us for a flight control malfunction. We had every intention to request priority handling, but we were still engaging the checklist. The next checklist we ran was the all flaps up landing checklist. Step 1 states, 'Accomplish this checklist only by the flaps-trailing edge flaps up landing checklist.' We did not have a disagreement or asymmetry indication. We had no indications. We determined this checklist did not apply and step 4 sent us to the no flap landing checklist. After running the no flap landing checklist and checking the non-normal landing configuration tables, we elected to divert to ZZZ1 and land on Runway XXC. We briefed the Flight Attendants and told them no evacuation preparation was necessary. We had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) standing by as a precaution. Approach speed was 196 kts. We used maximum manual braking and full reverse thrust and exited the runway. The landing was very smooth and braking was normal. After parking at the gate we debriefed each other of what went well and what could have gone better, then debriefed the Flight Attendants, Maintenance, and Dispatch.				B737 Captain reported that a slat failure required a diversion to a nearby airport after a consultation with dispatch and maintenance did not remedy the situation.

PM ran the QRH which led us to discover the manual gear extension door was not sufficiently closed. We ran the complete checklist, raised the gear and continued to destination.		During initial climb landing gear did not retract when moved to up, requested vectors and accomplished QRH procedures, gear retracted successfully when manual extension door micro-switch was reset and flight continued to destination. Small delay in changing from tower frequency to departure frequency on initial climb due to prioritized flight path management.		B737 flight crew reported the landing gear would not retract after departure. After discovering the manual gear retraction door was not fully closed the crew was able to retract the gear and continue to the destination airport.

We quickly discovered the unreliable airspeed indicator. Completed some of the memory items associated with this issue. Told ATC we needed to return. We remained in IMC conditions for the remainder of the flight. Ran the checklist for unreliable airspeed. Overweight landing. Non routine landing, and subsequently ENG EEC alternate mode. We had an uneventful landing and taxi to the gate under our own power. Elected to use ATC vectors instead of holding. No injuries, no damage to aircraft other than pitot tube and possibly air temperature probe which affected the EEC's per maintenance call. Log book entries included. Bird strike with unreliable airspeed. Overweight landing. ENG EEC to alternate mode, and pulling voice recorder per company procedure. Received a phone call from ZZZ Approach Control where they filled out a bird strike paperwork via phone call with myself. Just want to say that our training works. This was the new hire FO first flying leg. Did an excellent job of maintaining aircraft control under these particular failures. The Flight Attendants also did a great job of taking care of passengers and preparing the cabin for an unplanned return to the airport.				B737-800 Captain reported a bird strike after take-off.

I thought we had had an engine failure and aborted the takeoff. We decelerated the aircraft as smoothly as possible and exited the runway. During the rollout we were able to discern that the engine had not failed, but were unclear on what may have happened. The first officer then mentioned that he thought he saw a piece of paper blowing across the runway indicating that perhaps there was a dust devil in the area of the runway.  We brought the aircraft to a stop on the taxiway.  Approximately five minutes after this, a company ops car came by to assess the situation and communicated to the tower who communicated to us that the two left main tires had blown. We then set about coordinating with company to have passengers transported back to terminal as the aircraft could not be taxied. At this point in time, my only guess is that a significant wind event took place at that part of the runway, causing the aircraft to move as it did. It was as close to a simulator engine failure as I could ever imagine. The ATIS at that time was just showing a normal day for ZZZ. I don't know how I could stop the wind from blowing the way it did, but I recommend continued training in rejected take offs in the simulator.				Air carrier captain reported a rejected takeoff after the aircraft began to yaw and was unable to correct it. After inspection it was discovered two main tires had blown and a suspected dust devil may have been in the immediate area.

As we got the checklist out we continued to climb and leveled off at 9,000 feet. Following the QRH procedure, it directed us to close the #1 thrust lever until the light goes out. We got all the way to idle and the light remained on. The checklist then directs you to the engine shut down checklist. We elected to keep the engine running since all the parameters were still normal. We advised ATC and diverted to ZZZ1. On final approach to Runway XXL at approximately 500 feet, we got a large bird strike just above the #2 engine. The good engine. We landed without incident and made the turnoff on Runway XYR. The #1 engine was shut down and we had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) inspect the #1 engine. No abnormalities were noticed, and we taxied to gate with ARFF following.				B737 First Officer reported receiving an oil filter bypass warning on the number one engine during climb out. A diversion was initiated resulting in a safe landing.

After three reroutes we then was cleared for position and hold. We aligned on Runway X be ready for immediate departure traffic 2 miles out. Aligned, I held the brakes powered up the engines to approximately 40% N1 FF approximately 1400 pounds, feeling the aircraft rumble/ shake engines stabilized are ready to go. Once cleared for Takeoff I then stood up engines throttles to the 12 o'clock position stable released brakes with aircraft moving then smoothly advanced to FLEX detent. Once in detent with engines powered up I could not keep aircraft on center line and was veering quickly to the right. Giving the engines No 2 sec more to catch up, veering uncontrollably to the right off center line. I rejected the takeoff, full reverse manual brakes and placing my hand on the tiller to align back to center line. This exacerbated the loss of nose control, nose wheel skidding on the wet runway left then right then to a slight left. I then once again hit the brakes to a quick total stop. All then cooled down on runway with reversers stowed. We then taxied off on the second left taxiway. This event on the runway was approximately 850 ft. total airspeed was not even alive for the First Officer (FO) 'call' We both examined all engine gauges all was normal and sat for a moment to review what just went on called the flight staff on all call. They were all OK and passengers too then several passengers wanted to get off jet as we were think if it would it be prudent to go to gate for maintenance review. This was then with no hesitation of us to go back to the gate and deplane jet and allow maintenance to figure out what was the cause of engine issue.The use of the tiller exacerbated the loss of control of aircraft steering below VMC ground on a wet runway. The use of the brakes to a stop is when we truly regained total control of the Jet. Once we returned to gate is when we then realized the event and how my adrenaline was running. The station manager even noticed how our demeanor was and asked how we felt. I was reluctant to say then it hit me I need to wind the clock and slow down I then called myself off of the flight, fatigued not safe. I as Captain felt not safe to continue flying this day. Take the event in to adjust there was no hull loss nor any soul lost and the next day I flew as Captain ZZZ to ZZZ2 with no further issues.				A320 Captain reported a loss of directional control resulted in a rejected takeoff. The flight crew elected to return to the gate for maintenance action and to deplane several passengers who did not want to continue on the flight.

We had no airspeed indications, but estimate airspeed at reject around 60 kts.Mud daubers in all three pitot tubes while aircraft stored at hangar for 5 days. Upon returning to gate, Maintenance stated mud in all 3 pitot tubes from mud daubers and 5 day storage in hangar and pitot covers NOT installed. He knew covers not installed because no logbook entry of installation and removal. He also stated experienced mechanics know pitot covers should be installed during any storage, but there is NO procedure in their manuals to aid newer tech's that might not know this.		On take-off at approximately 80 kts, I observed that the airspeeds had not come alive. I called the reject and stopped the aircraft and returned to the gate. Maintenance inspected the aircraft and found that mud nests had obstructed the pitot tubs. Pitot covers were not installed while the aircraft sat at the hangar for multiple days. Procedures should be followed or changed that would require the installation of pitot tube covers to aircraft parked for extended periods of time.		B777 flight crew reported a rejected take-off due to inoperative airspeed indications. Post flight inspection found blockage of pitot tubes.

MSL aircraft was IMC. In flight visibility at 1/2 mile. F/O (First Officer) [was] Pilot Flying. Traffic Advisory on PFD. I made a comment to not to descend yet due to the traffic. In seconds, the traffic converged and climbed causing a Resolution Advisory for the aircraft now at our 930. I observed the red climb bar on the PFD. I advised the First Officer to immediately initiate a climb to avoid the conflict. Simultaneously, I looked outside and got visual contact with the Aircraft Y co-altitude, belly up and with a vector into us. It was in a hard left bank to evade. I advised Tower that we were climbing for a Resolution Advisory. He advised ZZZ [Tracon] was talking to that aircraft. Tower asked if we could still land. I advised it was not possible, and that we would take vectors for another approach. Once the aircraft was clean, stable and safe, I made a public address to the Passengers advising what happened, that automated systems advised of the conflict, that we were safe, and will be landing shortly. Passengers seemed happy after we got to the gate. The Passenger in seat 1A reported seeing another aircraft at the time that our engine noise increased. In the process of transitioning from evasive maneuver into a go-around, we got an air speed, low warning. I advised the F/O to reduce climb angle and increase power, but to monitor his speed. It was a momentary deviation. I assess this conflict as a near miss that likely would've resulted in a mid-air collision if not for immediate adherence to the Resolution Advisory. I am not sure what could've been done differently. We complied with the Resolution Advisory immediately. The Cessna was in IMC conditions that they were likely not qualified for. I believe our procedures and training allowed us to mitigate the situation and safely maneuver the aircraft while avoiding a mid-air collision.		On a 9-mile final into ZZZ Runway XX, established on the localizer, 1,600 ft., 180 kts, Flaps 15, landing gear down. Tower advised traffic 9-10 o'clock, 500 ft. below, will remain clear of final. At 8-mile final, traffic turned amber on MFD TCAS, indicated -04, roughly 2 miles northwest. At 7-mile final, traffic indicated red on TCAS, -02 inside of a 1-mile northwest of our position. I immediately added thrust and pitched up, following command indications on the PFD. At that point, the Captain observed the traffic banking away (belly up from our vantage point) roughly 200 ft. below and 1/2 (half) a mile. We then executed a go-around climbing to 3,000 ft. on runway heading per Tower instructions. Landed safely on next approach.		B737 flight crew reported an airborne conflict with a small aircraft while on initial approach in IMC. Captain took evasive action to avoid a collision and conducted a go around to a landing.

During our preflight we noted current MEL items and an inbound write-up. The aircraft had two concerning MELs, the Fuel Auto Feed Center tank pumps were inoperative and the ACARS Printer was inoperative. We discussed the Center Tank Fuel pumps and were not concerned as we were not going to have center tank fuel. The ACARS Printer was a bigger threat as we would have to transcribe all our ACARS information. We would also have to receive the Maintenance Release in paper form. The inbound write-up was for the #2 Pack Flow Control always in LO. There was a Mechanic on board looking at something in the cabin. I asked him if he was aware of and dealing with the inbound write-up. he indicated he would check, but I never heard back from him.As we were finalizing our preflight, I called Dispatch to see if they could find out about our pack write-up. They said they would ask Maintenance Control and call back. They called back a few minutes later with Maintenance Control on the line. Maintenance Control advised that they would just defer the #2 pack if that was okay with Dispatch. Maintenance Control proceeded to go through an MEL procedure. I assumed he was just telling me about it and did not realize initially that they wanted me to complete the deferral process. I asked them if we have Maintenance here and why can they not do this? He blew me off and said we can just walk through this process. I had him hold for a minute while I discussed the concern of losing one pack with my FO (First Officer). He was okay and I knew we could talk about it more if needed. So I found the MEL card, 21-XX-X for PACK 2, followed Maintenance Control's instructions, and we deferred the pack. I spoke with Dispatch again and discussed the new release and the need to have a paper Maintenance Release sent to the aircraft.I finally had a free moment to bring ZZZ Operations into the loop about the status of the maintenance issues and to inform the FAs (Flight Attendant) of why the delay and what impact the single pack may have on cabin comfort. My FO and I then had a detailed discussion about the implications of all these MEL items and the pack in particular. In my mind, I had always reserved the final right to turn down this plane if we felt uncomfortable. We talked about the weather in ZZZ1 and how the pack inoperative may affect us. We felt that there was no present threat with the pack inoperative and the forecasted low ceilings in ZZZ1. We noted that all our alternates, including closer airports than the planned ZZZ2, were good alternates. We also discussed that we had lots of alternates all down the coast in the event we had any pack related complications. We decided the fuel MEL would not be a labor intensive and the ACARS Printer was more labor intensive, but not a concerning threat. We came to the conclusion that we would go once we got the Maintenance Release.We started up and normal taxi and takeoff out of ZZZ. Normal climb and level off at cruise FL290, for turbulence above. As we passed over ZZZ3 and were continuing to the south, we got an ECAM, HYD Y ENG PUMP PR LO. It was my leg, I said I have the aircraft and the radios and the FO completed the ECAM. We noted the low level in the yellow system and the inoperative PTU (Power Transfer Unit). We assessed our options, continue to ZZZ4 or turn back for ZZZ3, ZZZ1 was not a consideration. ZZZ4 was about one hour and twenty minutes away with comparable weather to ZZZ3. We transferred the controls and comms to FO. I called Dispatch to bring them into the loop and see what their recommendations were. I discussed the issue and they recommended ZZZ4. I told them to hold and discussed it with my FO. We discussed the potential for additional fluid loss. We could tell we had lost fluid, but did not know from where. As silly as it may sound, I was not in the mood to lose a second HYD system to a mystery leak. Considering time in route to ZZZ4 and proximity to ZZZ3, we chose to go back into ZZZ3. I informed Dispatch that we considered ZZZ4, but were being more cautious and chose ZZZ3. I informed the flight attendants and then informed the passengers.We then [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center and proceeded back to ZZZ3. Checklists and landing performance, V-speeds and conditions considered, we chose vectors for a straight-in ILS to a visual approach to Runway XXR. We discussed the approach considering the flaps and the after-landing contingencies. We assessed the tools we had and did not have, normal brakes, nose wheel steering, only one thrust reverser, slow flap deployment, less effective spoilers. The landing was normal - for me! - and uneventful. We declined any assistance on the runway and told them we would be able to exit and taxi to a gate. We declined any further need of the CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) equipment as all was normal for the taxi. We taxied to the gate, parked, and shut down as normal. We had some complication at the gate with deplaning the passengers. The ZZZ3 Station Operations was there to meet us, but they were unsure whether to deplane or what the plan was. Then once they had a plan, they had a computer issue with the gate reader to accurately deplane the passengers in the system. With a few calls to Chief Pilot [and] their help from the Company Communications System, we were able to get the passengers off the aircraft and taken care of. We and the flight attendants debriefed and we deplaned. FO and I discussed continuing for the day and determined that we were safer not continuing. We worked with the crew desk to reschedule.				A320 Captain reported receiving an ECAM, HYD Y ENG PUMP PR LO during cruise flight. Due to the possibility of additional fluid loss from the unknown leak, the flight crew opted to land at an alternate airport.

ATC issued us a level off at 12,000 ft. then notified us of a possible altitude deviation at KRUGR. The aircraft was being flown in LNAV/VNAV on B Autopilot with FL190 in the altitude pre-select window. Upon issue of new clearance to level off at 12,000 ft., I reselected 12,000 ft. in the altitude pre-select window and disconnected the autothrottles to reduce the climb rate as we were passing 11,800 ft. The aircraft climbed to 12,150 ft. before leveling off at 12,000 ft. where I re-engaged the autothrottles. At this time we were told to look for traffic at 14,000 ft. which we had visually behind us. We never had an RA or TA. ATC then notified us of a possible altitude deviation at KRUGR. At this point we were approximately 24 miles past KRUGR on the JOHKR 3. We had briefed the departure and verified all altitudes and airspeed restrictions on the departure. Once established in cruise, the Captain and I debriefed the event trying to troubleshoot a possible error. One conclusion we arrived at was as we were approaching SELLZ I had asked him to delete the N1 restriction and he interpreted this as delete the ALT restriction at SELLZ since we were below the 8,000 ft. restriction. We didn't confirm the next waypoint as we got distracted with Climb Checklist and I believe a little wake turbulence from preceding aircraft. One thing would be to standardize the callout for deleting N1 reduction. I should have delayed the call for the Climb Checklist until work load permitted.				B737-700 First Officer reported climbing above an altitude restriction departing LAS, citing distractions from checklist and wake turbulence as contributing to the incident.

Everything was fine until we reached V1. As soon as my hand was a few inches off of the throttles, the fire warning horn and lights were going off everywhere. We were just past V1 so we were in go mode. As soon as I got the gear up and saw the aircraft was under control I looked down to see what all was lit up. We had both master caution lights, both fire warning lights, the fire bell, both engine 1 and 2 overheat lights, engine 1 and 2 fire handles lit up, the APU fire handle lit up and the wheel well fire light lit up. I immediately [requested priority handling] and told them we wanted to climb to 2500 ft. while entering a left downwind and base and land back on XXL. The FO was very sharp and I asked them if they felt comfortable doing that on their own while I worked the problem. They were fine and I kept an eye on the plane and our position while getting into the checklist. I went straight to the wheel well fire checklist because I felt that was our biggest threat. Both engines were running normal and no abnormal indications and the APU was off so I thought the wheel well could be on fire or have bad indications. I gave souls on board, fuel in minutes, stated our intentions and asked them to relay our situation to our company. I did the QRH, we quickly set up for the approach and turned base for XXL.I tested the lead Flight Attendant (FA) and gave a very brief PA to the passengers, ran the descent and landing checklists and landed and stopped on taxiway x. We shut both engines down and Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) said all indications were normal and no abnormal heat anywhere. We got a gate from ops, started the engines and taxied to gate. Before we taxied onto the J-line I had them check the temps again and then we taxied in and de-boarded the people. After we re-started both engines I went to put the generators online and generator 2 started the fire bell and warning lights again. Generator 1 did not trip it. I put it on the APU and it did the same thing. I went back to the engine driven generators and same thing and again went back to the APU. When we went to ground power at the gate it did the same thing with the horn and lights. From there I wrote everything up and talked to Dispatch, Maintenance at ZZZ, Ops and the Chief Pilot. From there I made sure the passengers in the terminal were taken care of and then took care of the crew. We all went to the hotel for a much needed rest. I have no idea what set all of this in motion but I thought the crew, ATC, Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF), Ops, Dispatch, Maintenance and the Chief Pilot all did their jobs very well.		On takeoff roll saw fire master warning light right at V1. Captain said to continue so preceded to rotate at Vr. Once airborne we saw that we had all 3 fire handles illuminating along with the wheel well fire light and both engine overheat lights. The Captain said they smelled something when we brought the gear up but since we had all those lights we were not sure how to diagnose. We announced the situation at about 1500 ft. and I told the Captain to let Tower know I was turning left into the downwind. The Captain pulled the wheel well fire checklist since we did not have any secondary engine fire indications. I hand flew the aircraft at pattern altitude while the Captain ran the checklist and communicated with Tower. Once the checklist was complete I turned final and asked for final flaps with the landing checklist. I verified we were cleared to land and had an uneventful landing. We taxied off the runway and were inspected by the Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) before confirming that we were free from fire and getting a gate to taxi back into. As a crew, the Captain and I had really good communication and delegation of duties. I focused on the flying and kept the runway in sight and was ready to turn in for landing as soon as we were finished with our checklist. We had talked about what indications we were seeing and were able to quickly come up with a diagnosis and direction to a checklist. The Captain did a good job of coming in and out of the checklist when I was requesting configuration to remain close to the field. They also had a good suggestion for me to keep in the back of my mind when I touched down to be cautious of blown tires since we did not know if we had an actual wheel well fire or not at that point. Once on the ground we did a good job of communicating with Ground and CFR while keeping the crew and passengers informed of progress. Debriefing it together the only thing we could come up with that we could have done differently would have been to not raise the gear in case it was a wheel well fire. At the time, we were pretty sure it was an electrical issue due to the fact that so many lights had illuminated. What I would have done differently would have been to get flaps 5 with flaps 5 speed sooner to keep my pattern tighter and give more time for the checklist.		B737 flight crew reported the fire detection system malfunctioned after takeoff. The flight crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

Immediately after noticing this, we got a Master Warning followed by the Cabin Pressure Excessive Cabin Altitude ECAM. We immediately did our memory action items for [Priority] Descent and ran the QRC and started an [Priority] Descent. We notified ATC, and squawked 7700. The flight attendants were notified via the [priority] call button to immediately get on oxygen due to our cabin depressurization, and given the briefing. Once we were stabilized in the descent, I finished running the ECAM, and the QRH. We did an air return back to ZZZ and ran the overweight landing checklist in the QRH. The passenger oxygen masks deployed in the cabin. The flight attendants were smelling the smoke from the oxygen generators, but it sounded like it was more centrally located in the rear of the cabin toward the tail. We decided for precautionary measures to get CFR to inspect the tail section for any potential hot spots. All clear was given, and we then returned back to the gate with no further incidences. This discrepancy was entered into the aircraft logbook.We had no known passenger injuries. Three flight attendants, #2, #3, and #4, were complaining about being dizzy afterwards.		I was the pilot monitoring. As we were climbing through FL 330, I noticed that all indications were 'green,' but the cabin altitude was excessively high--9,200 ft.--and was rapidly increasing. Immediately after I asked the Captain about this reading, there was a Master Warning followed by the 'Cabin Pressure: Excessive Cabin Altitude' ECAM message. We immediately did our memory action items for [Priority] Descent. The Captain started an [Priority] Descent and told me to notify ATC that we need an [Priority] Descent to 10,000 MSL, which I did. He changed the transponder code to 7700. ATC initially cleared us down to FL 300, and very soon after to 10,000 MSL. The flight attendants were notified to 'get on oxygen' due to our cabin depressurization, and they were briefed.Once we were stabilized in the descent, the Captain gave me control of the airplane and then continued running the ECAM actions and the QRH. The passenger oxygen masks were deployed. Once we leveled at 10,000 MSL, we advised ATC that we wanted to return to ZZZ, and were given the clearance 'Right turn, direct ZZZ.'The Captain advised the passengers it was now safe to remove their masks. He also sent an ACARS message to Dispatch informing them of our pressurization and an air return back to ZZZ, and he ran the Overweight Landing checklist from the QRH. The two flight attendants in the rear of the aircraft informed us that they smelled the odor from the oxygen generators. The Captain told me to go fast in order to expedite our return. We decided on precautionary measures, so we advised ATC that we would be stopping on the runway and would need Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) inspect the aircraft for any potential hot spots. We also requested the longer Runway--XXR. After the Captain loaded the approach, he took control of the airplane. I made a brief announcement to the passengers that we would be stopping on the runway for a precautionary inspection.After landing and stopping on the runway, CFR inspected the airplane. 'All clear' was given to us, and we then taxied to the gate. After the cabin door was opened, the CFR leader came onto the flight deck to check if there were any injuries or medical issues. We had no known passenger injuries. Three flight attendants, #2, #3, and #4, were complaining about being dizzy afterwards. The original ECAM message and Overweight Landing were entered into the aircraft logbook.		A320 flight crew reported a loss of pressurization system during climb. Flight crew executed QRH procedures and requested priority handling to return to departure airport where a safe landing completed.

The aircraft also exhibited a slight veer to the left at the same time.  I felt this was an aircraft controllability issue (potential nose wheel gear or tire failure or separation) and therefore I made the decision to reject the takeoff. The RTO maneuver was initiated at 110 knots (VI-115 KTS) in accordance with company SOPs. The RTO QRC and RTO non-normal and brake cooling for 737-700 were completed. Due to the light weight of the aircraft, brake temperatures did not reach the caution or warning zones. As part of my RTO Briefings, I brief the First Officers to also request ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) if the RTO is performed in the High speed regime. The First Officer and I quickly discussed staying on the runway or exiting.  The taxiways were wide enough that we felt ARFF would have adequate maneuvering capabilities around the aircraft and therefore elected to clear the runway so that the runway was still usable after the runway FOD check was completed.ARFF response was within 3 minutes.  Communication was established with ARFF and ATC quickly and an assessment for fire or damage was completed.  I requested that the aircraft be chocked so the parking brake would not have to be set. ARFF performed temp checks of the main gears.  Left main temperature was 502 and right main temperature was 400. ARFF set up a fan to cool the gear while we coordinated with company and airport operations. We decided to have the aircraft towed to the gate and the tow-in checklist was referenced.After all procedures were completed I briefed the passengers and the First Officer and I had a debrief with the inflight crew to discuss the event.  All crew members felt communication was clear and concise and everyone remained calm.Once able, I called and debriefed the Chief Pilot on duty, and the HF checklist was conducted on me and my First Officer. I then called dispatch to conference with Maintenance Control to give a verbal debrief of the event. I also met with the ARFF crew to discuss and complement them on their response actions.The next day the nose wheel tires were changed and I was told by Maintenance Control there was evidence of tire imbalance.  We ferried the aircraft the next day to ZZZ1 and on taxi in the nose gear began to randomly vibrate at normal taxi speeds. Entry was made for nose gear vibration and I verbally briefed the outgoing flight crew and the mechanics. Maintenance elected to take the aircraft out of service for additional inspections and an additional tire replacement. I met with the maintenance manager later to ask for an update. I was told that when they removed the replacement tires and there was evidence of flat spots and they were going to begin inspections of the entire nose wheel gear and components.		We were cleared for take-off to fly tower assigned heading (Departure Runway- XXR). I was the PM (pilot monitoring) and Captain was the pilot flying. After the take-off thrust was set, I called 100 knots, when extreme vibration started from the nose wheel of the airplane. The Captain decided to reject the takeoff before V1 was called out. The rejection was done at approximately 110 IAS and the Captain followed the RTO procedures specified in the FM. I verified the procedure and made the required calls of 80 Knots and informed ATC and made the PA, 'Remain Seated, Remain Seated'.We discussed and decided to vacate the runway (from Taxi-way 1), and advised tower to roll out the fire trucks, since we rejected above 100 knots. We held short of Taxi-way 2 on 3. The Captain tried to set the parking brakes, however he was not able to do so. Also, at the time the parking brake indicator light went out (INOP). The Captain called for the RTO QRC, which was completed and after discussing the situation with the FA in the cabin, the decision was made not to evacuate. The Fire Rescue team (4-trucks) responded and were next to us within 3 minutes. I continued on the checklist and calculated the brake-cooling time, which was approximately 45-50 minutes for our weight and speed. We were out of the caution and warning zone. Communication was established with the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) team and Captain advised them to put chocks on the nose wheel (since we could not set the parking brake). The ARFF team advised us that they did not see any visual damage to the landing gear or the tires. There was also no indication of fire or smoke. We started the APU and decided to the shut down both engines for the safety of ARFF and ground personnel.We decided the aircraft was in good condition, however as a precaution, we requested airport operations and company operations to have our aircraft towed to the gate. The captain made a PA and was advised by the FA that everyone was calm. He also advised them that we will be heading to the gate. While the tow truck was being organized, the tower switched us to ground frequency and we were in contact with ARFF, ground and airport Ops. We followed the supplementary procedure to be towed to the gate. Once at the gate, we performed the parking checklist and the passengers were deplaned using the jet bridge. We made the required reports (verbal/ACARS) to Chief Pilot, dispatch, maintenance and put in two ELB reports -  i) For the RTO due to Extreme Nosewheel Vibration and ii) Parking Brake Light in-op.The ARFF team came to meet us at the flight deck and gave us the information about gear temperature (500+ for left gear and 450+for right). They also mentioned that they used fans to cool down the gear system. We were advised by Maintenance Control that they will have Maintenance check the nose wheel assembly and have both the wheels replaced. However, due to lack resources at an out-station, the wheels could not be replaced and the flight was canceled.Next, day we were scheduled to operate the ferry flight to take the airplane back to ZZZ1. The Captain was informed that the vibration may have been caused due to wheel being out of balance. The wheels were replaced and we departed ZZZ. However, upon landing and taxing in at ZZZ1, we felt vibrations in nose-wheel again and we made an ELB write up again. We also briefed the next crew on the situation and the aircraft was taken out of service and additional inspection. The Captain was advised by the Maintenance manager/supervisor in ZZZ1 that the replacement tire had flat spots and will inspect the nose wheel assembly and the gear system too.		B737 flight crew reported a rejected take off at 110 knots for violent lateral nose wheel vibrations. The flight crew returned to the gate and turned the aircraft over to maintenance.

Executed a go-around. Executed QRH procedure. Attempted to lower flaps using the alternate flaps switch. First Officer (FO) reported an asymmetry developing. Flaps were at approximately 11 degrees. [Requested priority handling]. Requested the long Runway XXR. Landed uneventfully. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) checked tires and brakes and we taxied back to our gate. This Aircraft X, has had 3 flap related malfunctions in the month alone. Company Maintenance has failed to repair this aircraft properly. QRH could also have a quicker reference for flap issues. Intuitively one would search for flaps. The procedure is labeled trailing edge flap disagree. Adding to the time to find the procedure. The aircraft has had repeated flap issues that maintenance needs to resolved before the aircraft re enters service.		While on the RNAV Z XXL approach we noticed flaps were not indicating 30 degrees when the flap handle was at 30. We executed a go around. While performing the go-around, moving the flap handle did not change the flap indicator. We requested runway heading and performed the QRH procedure. We attempted the alternate flap extension but noticed this was causing an asymmetric flap situation so we stopped the flaps at roughly 12 degrees. We [requested priority handling] and requested vectors back to XXR. Upon landing and exiting the runway Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) checked the tries and brakes for excessive heat. Taxied back to the gate. Aircraft X has had multiple flap related issues in the past months. This aircraft needs to be fixed. As the pilot monitoring I had a hard time finding the appropriate checklist for this situation. Quick link to FLAPS would have been helpful vs trying to locate trailing edge devices. Aircraft being thoroughly inspected when a persistence maintenance problem exist.		B737 flight crew reported trailing edge flaps failed to extend on final approach. The flight crew performed a go-around to troubleshoot and use alternate method for flap extension. The flaps then suffered a flap asymmetry condition, resulting in the flight crew receiving vector and making a precautionary landing at destination airport.

Aircraft was on pre-existing MEL for one of the two control channels of the right AC pack being INOP. During cruise phase the right pack tripped off. No cabin pressure anomalies were noted. Followed QRH procedures to reset & restore right pack normal operations. Which were successful for only a minute or two then the trip recurred. At which point we followed QRH guidance for an non resettable trip, which amounted to turning off that pack and proceeding single pack. We discussed continuing or dropping into ZZZ which was then a couple hundred miles ahead of us. We were both slightly against proceeding as to this flight, but were more concerned about delivering a broken airplane to ZZZZ for the return flight than we were for our own situation. Elected to contact Dispatch & Maintenance Control for advice. Swapped PF/PM roles so CA could concentrate on admin while First Officer (FO) flew. Asked FO to prepare mentally and set up the aircraft for a divert to ZZZ in case we went that way. Had no success with the crew phone system using either pilot's iPad. From the sound of the audio distortion it appeared we simply did not have the bandwidth for voice traffic when competing with all the other traffic from passenger use of the internet connection. Attempted contact via the dedicated Dispatch radio in ZZZ. That was also unsuccessful. Finally contacted Dispatch via VHF phone patch. After conferring with them, a joint decision was made to land at ZZZ. Which would be an overweight landing by ~6000 lbs.The Captain performed all relevant QRH and normal checklists while FO flew. Once ready to return we [requested priority handling] with ATC for overweight landing, with no additional assistance or priority required. Changed control to CA as PF. A normal arrival, approach and smooth landing was performed using maximum reverse thrust and minimal wheel braking. After shutdown all required maintenance log entries and required reports to Dispatch were complied with. Flying an aircraft with half of a dual-redundant system out leaves us exposed to the second system failing too. Once that has happened the rest of the evolution is pretty inevitable. Not that this is a crisis; merely a statistical certainty given large numbers of flights with items on MEL. The largest challenge of the whole evolution was contacting Dispatch for a consultation. Years ago that was simply deemed 'too hard' in most situations and Captains could and did make their decisions mostly unilaterally. In the current era that's not as acceptable as it once was. Given that attitude, it seems important that the system on the airplane actually be reliable for crew use. Which indicates that the on-board router system should be configured to throttle or disable passenger data traffic as needed to ensure the crew voice traffic has priority when needed.				B737 Captain reported #2 air conditioning pack control problems in cruise. The flight crew elected to divert and make an uneventful landing.

We then decided to go around to troubleshoot the problem. We notified ATC that we would need delay vectors to run the necessary checklists. We ran the QRH checklist for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree; the checklist had us setup to use the alternate flap extension procedure.  After getting flaps 15 landing data and brake cooling data for Runway XXR we had ATC vector us back around for another approach. The leading flaps and slats extended to the full ext position using the alternate flap switch. When we went to extend the trailing edge flaps, only the left began to extended and I immediately stopped extending the flaps as we now had flap asymmetry. We notified ATC we could not fly the approach and would need a longer runway at ZZZ1 along with delay vectors. We began to run the QRH checklist for Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry as directed by the QRH 'Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree' checklist. As ATC began to vector us for ZZZ1 dispatch sent us an ACARS message that they ran the numbers for a Flaps up landing and that XXR at ZZZ would be suitable for a 0 flaps landing. We ran the numbers as well and agreed with dispatch. We then completed the QRH checklist and received Brake cooling data as well. We notified ATC that we could in fact accept XXR at ZZZ and received vectors for the visual approach. We Performed a 0 flaps landing on Runway XXR at ZZZ. As directed by the brake cooling data, we proceeded to Pad XX and waited the 70 minutes for the brakes to cool with fire trucks monitoring.  After the 70 minutes we proceeded to Gate XX and deplaned. A maintenance discrepancy was written in the maintenance log.				B737 First Officer reported trailing edge flaps failed to extend on approach. The flight crew performed a go around to trouble shoot, then use the alternate flap extension procedures. This resulted in a flap asymmetry condition. The flight crew received vector back to make a precautionary landing at destination airport.

I immediately looked at the engine instruments and all was normal. I stated to the First Officer (FO) that I thought we may have hit a bird and he agreed with my assessment. I contacted the cabin crew to get their input. Both forward flight attendants (FA) heard the noise but didn't know what it was. The aft flight attendants did not hear the noise. After hanging up the interphone, I began to smell a noxious odor. The flight attendants called me back to report a noxious smell throughout the entire aircraft. I actioned the [smoke and fumes] QRC immediate action items and both the first officer and I donned our full face oxygen masks. I requested priority handling with ATC and was given priority for landing. Since we had already briefed the approach to Runway XXL, I elected to continue to that runway even though it was the shortest runway given that we had no mechanical issues and it would allow us to get the airplane on the ground the quickest. I sent an ACARS message to dispatch informing them of the situation. I then called the flight attendants and gave them a standard briefing informing them of the situation. I continued running the QRC while the first officer flew the airplane and communicated with ATC. We completed the first steps and abandoned the checklist after ATC cleared us for the approach and I felt my attention was better focused on backing up the FO and monitoring the approach and landing. After clearing the runway, Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) inspected our aircraft. After speaking with them, I felt it was safe to continue to the gate. A flight attendant called to report that a passenger was experiencing sickness and had vomited as a result of the smell. I asked if the passenger needed EMTs to meet us. The flight attendant informed me the passenger declined medical treatment. Upon arrival at the gate, we completed the required maintenance reports and flight operations contacts. Upon external inspection the remains of a large bird was observed forward of the nose wheelwell and throughout the right engine.		While on the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ, we were level crossing ZZZZZ1 at 11,000 ft. and 300 kts, we hit a large brown bird. For about just a flash, I saw a large Brown/blackish bird in-front of the aircraft and go under us. It hit underneath the nose and made a loud bang. I didn't think it went toward the engine, but a few seconds after the hit, we smelled a burnt odor. We knew that it must have gone through an engine. We scanned the engine instruments and everything was normal. Because the odor got worse and was reported by the flight attendants (FA) as well, we completed the [smoke and fumes] checklist. As part of the checklist we put on the O2 masks. This caused difficulty through out the rest of the flight. After completing the Immediate action items, I continued to fly and talk to ATC, while the Captain (CA) handled the situation with dispatch, the FAs. We continued the arrival and were given priority for the approach to XXL. After landing, the Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) only found a mark on the nose with no other damage. The odor remained in the aircraft even after getting parked at the gate.		Air carrier flight crew reported a bird strike during approach which resulted in a strong odor throughout the aircraft. The flight crew completed a safe landing with the ground personnel providing appropriate support.

Followed the QRH and generator was reconnected. A couple of minutes later, the #1 generator failed again but the Bus Tie did not automatically pick up Transfer Bus 1, which resulted in numerous failures. The Transfer Bus Off light did not illuminate, which was confusing. We started the APU and when selected, the APU generator did not pickup generator #1. After a couple of minutes, we tried again and the APU generator successfully picked up generator #1. We decided to divert while enroute to ZZZ to ZZZ1 due to the seriousness of the Bus Tie relay not working correctly, ZZZ was holding for thunderstorms, ZZZ1 was clear plus has Company maintenance. The landing in ZZZ1 was uneventful. By the way, we accomplished an engine run for maintenance in ZZZ3 before departing because Maintenance worked on the #1 generator and wanted to make sure it worked since it had failed on the previous flight. The plane, Aircraft X, recently came out of a heavy C check. We couldn't find in the QRH or AOM the specific components that would fail if the Bus Tie system does not work.				B737 Captain reported the number 1 engine-driven generator and the Bus Tie system malfunctioned during cruise flight. Due to weather and the potential safety hazard of the malfunctioning systems, the flight crew opted to divert to an alternate airport.

We were cleared for takeoff, and everything was normal from brake release to about 80 kts. Just when I was about to make the 80 kts. call, there was a loud bang, the aircraft shuddered and yawed significantly to the right. The Captain immediately rejected the take-off and used the rudder to the right to keep it on the runway. We slowed to a manageable speed (unknown, I wasn't looking anymore), and I saw engine fail displayed on the number 2 engine display with the EGT dropping. I called Tower to tell them we aborted the takeoff and requested to roll Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles and we had a right engine failure. We exited the runway on taxiway x and held on y to assess and run checklists. The Captain told the passengers to remain seated. We also told Tower that they should check the runway for debris due to the engine failure. We ran the engine failure checklist and coordinated with Tower, fire trucks, Dispatch, Ops, passengers and Flight Attendants to make sure everything and everybody was okay. After about 15-20 minutes of coordination and checklists, we taxied back to the terminal, parked and allowed the passengers to deplane.		During takeoff, prior to 80 kts, the pilots heard a loud bang and their #2 engine failed. They stopped the aircraft. They called for Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF). They followed the QRH procedure and then monitored brake cooling procedures. The ARFF trucks escorted them to the gate. Debris from the engine failure was found on the runway.		B737 First Officer reported engine failure on takeoff. The flight crew rejected the take-off and returned to the gate for maintenance action.

On landing, ECAM ENG 1 THR LEVER DISAGREE, only engine #2 went into reverse thrust with slight pull to the right. Once slowed, we exited the runway on taxiway 1, when ECAM HYD G RSVR LO LVL illuminated. Stopped aircraft with alternate brakes at intersection of taxiway 1 and taxiway 2. Note, during transfer of braking, aircraft braking was sluggish and brake pedals had limited response. When the brakes finally engaged, anti skid protection activated. Since there was no steering, aircraft was directed towards median between taxiways. Aircraft stopped on the midline of the taxiway heading. ZZZ Ground indicated we had a large pool of fluid forming under the fuselage of the aircraft. ECAMs were completed and APU started. Flight Attendant briefings were completed. PA announcement made to the passengers. ZZZ Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) responded to ensure the safety of aircraft. Hazardous material spill cleanup responded to aircraft. Because of loss steering and normal brakes, aircraft was towed to gate. Passengers disembarked via jet way. ZZZ airport safety, CFR and HAZMAT debriefed crew. After initial briefing to Purser who relayed info to aft Flight Attendants, aft Flight Attendants indicated they smelled hydraulic fluid. I had to directly call them to discern what they really meant, understand current cabin status. Confusion could have led to unnecessary evacuation. Location of aircraft near ZZZ XXL and high speed taxiway during continued airport operations created difficulty for CFR, and HAZMAT response crews.		We were cleared to land on Runway XXL in ZZZ. Approach and touchdown were normal. Upon rollout we had a left reverser unlocked ECAM message. We continued to decelerate and exit the runway at taxiway. While exiting the aircraft braked hard and the Captain (CA) said I do not have any more brakes or steering and they set the parking brake. I informed Ground Control that we had a steering issue and would need to remain in place while we figured out what was wrong. Ground told us to proceed as requested. We ran the ECAM which led us to shut off the hydraulic pump and the left engine. Other aircraft told us we had fluid dripping from the underside of the center's fuselage and a large puddle under the aircraft. We then coordinated with Company operations and Ground Control to get a tug to tow us into gate. Airport operations and the Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) escorted us to the gate. The tow in was uneventful. After passengers deplaned Company Maintenance came aboard. We briefed Maintenance and then took over the airplane. We continued on the remainder of our pairing without further incident.		A320 flight crew reported ECAM HYD G RSVR LO LVL illuminated after landing with ECAM ENG 1 THR LEVER DISAGREE and no reverser deployed on the number one engine. The flight crew moved off the active runway and requested a tow to the gate.

I observed the target get to -200 ft. with a climbing arrow. After, 'clear of conflict,' we descended back down to 4,000 ft. and performed the rest of the flight without issue. The FO stated he was close enough to see the guys face. Upon further investigating ADS-B information, we discovered the other aircraft was a Cirrus SR22, departed ZZZ flying to ZZZ1. Cause [was] apparent lack of awareness of Class B airspace shelves from the other aircraft. The other aircraft needs to know what the airspace limits are and why they are there.

Made the PA to remain seated and that we'll be right back with you. Assessed that there was no fire and cleared the runway to the right at Taxiway 1 and requested the fire trucks to inspect the aircraft. Had the First Officer pull out the QRH for an engine failure, while I spoke to the Flight Attendant who said that all passengers were calm and confirmed no fire indications or fumes in the cabin. Performed the engine failure QRH. Ran brake cooling performance, which showed no restrictions. Fire informed us that the aircraft inspected well, no tire indications, brake temperatures indicated 170 degrees, and that they had no issue with us taxiing to a gate. Tower asked if we could move forward on Taxiway 2 and informed us that they did find shrapnel on the runway during their inspection.Coordinated with fire and did move forward onto [Taxiway] 2. I then called Dispatch who connected us to the Chief Pilot. I went over what happened with the Chief Pilot while the First Officer communicated with ZZZ Ops for a gate. The Chief Pilot agreed that we should taxi to the gate, which we did. Gate XX. Fire escorted us to the gate where medics also met us in the jet way to assess any panic or medical issues with passengers. Passengers were in general good spirits. I did try and greet as many as I could and ask if they were okay, especially those with children. All responded yes. ZZZ Manager and Supervisors were there to make sure all crew and passengers were okay. Called the Supervisor and asked if we should terminate and allow Ramp to move the aircraft and they said yes.

During event, Flight Attendants reported observing smoke on right engine via Purser and made second call from 3R detailing color change from white smoke to black smoke. I directed F/O (First Officer) to secure engine immediately. Three steps out of checklist sequence. ARFF on scene, but did not initially reply for status request on discreet frequency. I attempted to get status check relay from ARFF via Tower. I communicated with Purser on status. I went through briefing with Purser and advised I am trying NOT to evacuate. Once contacted and ARFF did not observe fire, I directed F/O to request ARFF escort to Gate XX. After gathering ourselves and advising Purser of intentions after landing flows and APU started for gate return, cabin was advised to remain seated until seat belt sign was off for gate return. Aircraft taxied to Gate XX with ARFF in tow. Flight deplaned normally. Purser called crew to first class for debrief. As we debriefed, discovered one Flight Attendant noticed flames in engine, but could not get the word to flight deck due to busy PA/Intercom.

Normal walk around. Nothing abnormal visual or systems wise. The only thing we had discussed a few times while waiting for the Maintenance Release was something to the effect of ETOPS flight needed. I am not sure if that was from the previous flight. This was an issue that was brought up a few times. Both between Captain, myself, and MX (Maintenance). MX said this had been completed. Normal taxi out. I had planned a runway XXL departure as well as pulled data for runway XXR. They gave us a runway change with two aircraft ahead of us to depart. I was able to load new data and run the Runway Change Checklist and verbalized it while doing so. I noticed Captain was following along while I was verbalizing and pointing to the changes I had made. Tower cleared us for take-off and advised us of traffic on an 8 mile final. Captain was performing the take-off on runway XXR. After stabilizing the engines and advancing them to take-off power is when the engine failure occurred, I believe. We initially got a Config Steering Warning Message as we were being rushed by Tower to take-off since the traffic on a was now at a two mile final. This led to some confusion on my part until we both noticed the aggressive pull and center line deviation to the right. That is when I believe I called engine failure. Captain directed me to advise Tower and make a PA. After doing this, I returned with the Captain to try and figure out what went wrong. This is when we noticed the engine completely shutting down. Then the Engine Fail Caution Message populated. Captain commanded the Rejected Take-off Checklist and we started to run that. This checklist led us into the Engine Fail Checklist as well. After shutting down the engine and confirming we were on the ground, I believe the Engine Fail Checklist had me go back to finish the Rejected Take-off Checklist. It was at this point that other aircraft has advised the Tower that we were on fire. Tower said they had already called crash fire rescue. I do not believe the Captain heard this and I stated that we might be on fire and there was no need to tell Tower to roll the trucks since this had already been done. This led to some confusion on my part since we were not receiving any fire warning messages. Nor did we throughout the entire incident. We briefly mention going to the Evacuation Checklist, but since we could not yet confirm we were on fire, we continued with Rejected and Engine Fail Checklists. I asked Tower for a discreet frequency since everyone was stepping on each other due to multiple go-arounds. We had trouble trying to get hold of ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) on the discreet frequency and I went back to Tower to inform them that we had the parking brake set and no one was answering on the discreet frequency. Once we established communication, ARFF informed us that there was no fire, only white smoke coming out of the right engine. We worked out a taxi plan with Tower to get back to the gate with only one engine. We had ARFF follow us back to the gate where no further incidents occurred.Passengers deplaned normally through doors L1 and L2.				B777 flight crew reported engine failure on take-off roll and a subsequent rejected take-off and return to gate for maintenance action.

We could see rain showers west of the end of Runway XX. The ATIS reported thunderstorms SW moving NE of the airport. The previous regional jet aircraft reported some speed fluctuations but landing normal. Below 1500 feet Tower reported wind shear alert at approach end of runway with winds at 14kts gusts to 23. I requested a side step to Runway XXL which was clear but was told unable due to aircraft on 2 mile final on Runway XXL. The First Officer continued the approach with the auto pilot off and was on speed 146+15=164 till about 300 feet when the airspeed started to increase with the power at idle and caused the flaps to retract to 25. We got the too low terrain call outs but continued to a normal landing as the rain showers had now moved towards the departure end of the runway and we did not want to perform a go around into that weather. It was a normal landing on speed. On roll out we encountered moderate rain by the exit taxiway.		Rain showers and 15 knot loss of airspeed reported on departure end of Runway XX. We were on the ILS final to Runway XX. Winds were from the west at 14 gust to 23. Our 30 flap ref speed was 149 and our target speed was 164  We were on airspeed and glide path and stable at 500 ft. AGL. At 300 ft. AGL we picked up 10 knots of airspeed and I was countering by pulling power. Airspeed reached 175 and flaps blew up. We got warning for terrain too low because of flap position. I was back on airspeed of 164 and on glide path before runway threshold. Good landing on centerline and speed and normal rollout before rain showers on departure end of Runway XX.		B737 flight crew reported an unstabilized approach in windshear alert conditions reported by ATC. The pilot flying continued the approach after speed increased by 10 knots at low altitude which caused the flaps to retract causing a EGPWS terrain warning for flaps in a non-landing configuration. The crew elected not to go around due to moderate rain at the far end of the runway, and landed safely.

At approximately 130 kt. the aircraft felt like the left side surged up in and then back down, then the left engine spooled back. I felt like we lost one or both tires. I called that out to the Captain. They agreed and called for a rejection. I responded with, "Agree reject." Then called, "Extended and deployed." Then, "Autobrake disarm.' We were stopped before I could call out the speed. I radioed the Tower that we had rejected on the runway and to standby. The Captain said wait and made an announcement for the passengers to remain seated. Then we reviewed the lights and status. We had no engine fire indication. But the left engine N1 was zero. I am not sure on what checklist we did or didn't do in that window. The CA (Captain) said I think we can taxi so I coordinated with the Tower to move off on the taxiway. And I [requested priority handling] and told them to send the fire trucks. When stopped on the taxiway I told the Fire Lead that the left engine and wheels were the concern.They checked them out, and said that they saw smoke coming from the left engine. The Fire Lead said they would inspect the left. The Captain and I agreed immediately to fire a bottle into the engine. There was still no fire indication. I ran the brake cooling while sitting on the taxiway. After the fire team cleared us from being on fire we asked for a place to park before returning to the gate, as directed by the brake cooling. We taxied on one engine to the Maintenance Ramp. There we sat while the fire team monitored the exterior. The Captain was on the phone with several company people while I monitored the fire team. Several minutes later the Fire Lead said that there was smoke coming from the engine and the temperature was rising. They said they were using a thermal monitor. I informed the Captain that I was firing the second bottle and they gave me the thumbs up. The Fire Lead would not let us return to the gate until they were confident we were not on-fire. They opened engine cowlings and then gave us the clear and moved the fire personnel out of the way. We taxied it to the gate.		During takeoff roll, the #1 engine had a seizure and over-temperature, resulting in a high-speed rejected takeoff at 130 kt., prior to V1 at 148 kt. We stopped straight ahead on the runway and I made a PA to the passengers to remain seated. We ran the QRH for an Engine Seizure Severe Separation Checklist. We then decided to move the aircraft off the runway onto Taxiway XX and waited for the fire trucks to arrive. We ran the performance data brake cooling in ACARS, for our hold time. The fireman reported a fire in our #1 engine so we blew the fire bottle and they doused it with water to cool it off. The fireman reported no visible damage to our flaps so we elected to move them up from Position 5. We then taxied to the Maintenance Hold Pad and chalked the nose gear to allow proper brake cooling. After 30 minutes, the fireman gave us clearance to proceed to the gate and we handed the aircraft over to Maintenance.		B737-800 flight crew reported the number one engine malfunctioned during the takeoff roll, resulting in a high-speed rejected takeoff.

I was on day 4 of a busy 4 day Pilot Monitoring (PM) trip, while the Captain had just joined the trip after some time off. While taxiing out in ZZZ we were asked to load performance numbers for an intersection departure. With the aircraft at a stop, I loaded the new intersection, and we ran the Departure Plan Checklist, verifying the flaps were set in the correct position (Flaps 1). We then lined up on the runway and started our takeoff role, with me acting as Pilot Flying (PF). there was a strong gusty crosswind and turbulent conditions in ZZZ. After rotation, I called for 'landing gear up' and the Captain responded with 'positive rate - Landing gear up'. I then noticed an unexpected change in performance and the aircraft's handling, and that the low-speed awareness ques where rising and I had lost my Flap 1 maneuvering que and my V2 + 15 'shark tooth'.I lowered the nose to gain airspeed and said, 'something doesn't feel right'. at around 1,000 ft. AGL we noticed that the landing gear was still down, and the Captain had accidentally retracted the flaps instead of the landing gear. We correctly configured the aircraft and continued to climb without any further incident, and never exceeded any structural limitations. While discussing this later, the Captain believed he had been so focused on setting the right flap setting during the Departure Plan Checklist that he sub-consciously grabbed the flap lever instead of the landing gear.I could have been more attentive as to the configuration of the aircraft. Also, we were both starting to feel tired, on top of a long taxi out with multiple changes. I had also been flying a MAX for most of the trip, and assumed the extra noise with the gear down was just because the -700 is a lot louder than the MAX.				B737-700 flight crew reported improper clean up sequence during departure climb resulting in momentary aircraft performance issues.

After holding short of Runway 08R, we were given clearance to takeoff on Runway 8R with a heading of 155 degrees after departure. In addition, we were asked to expedite due to traffic turning final for Runway 04R. Not wanting to rush my student I just repeated the cleared for takeoff clearance and completed the before takeoff checklist. Prior to moving the throttles forward, HNL Tower canceled our takeoff clearance while we were in position. After the B777 cleared overhead our runway centerline, we were once again cleared for takeoff. We took off on Runway 8R. On departure we flew through the wake turbulence of the prior aircraft which caused my student to initially think he might have had a tire blown. I mentioned it was wake turbulence and told him to continue. No further issues noted. Trying to time departures and arrivals for intersecting runways. Not enough time allowed to taxi a big wide body aircraft into position. Also, no allowing for the wake turbulence of the landing aircraft on the departing aircraft's takeoff roll. Allow more time for wide body aircraft.				B777 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence on initial climb out of HNL from another B777 landing on an intersecting runway.

Normal approach. I was unable to complete a full flare because my chart holder on the yoke was in a position that it caught on the seat buckle and I couldn't apply full back pressure to arrest the descent rate. This resulted in a firm landing in the touchdown zone. Speed brakes deployed as normal and aircraft remained on the runway. We taxied clear of the runway and to the gate. The cause is the position of chart holder in relation to seat/seat buckle position. Suggestion is adjusting seat height in relation to chart holder.				B737-800 First Officer reported a loss of aircraft control when their seat-belt buckle contacted the chart holder on the control yoke preventing aft movement during the landing flare. The aircraft landed firmly in the touchdown zone.

We leveled off at 10000 ft. and ran the engine limit, surge, stall checklist. No exceedances were observed on any of the engine gauges, just a momentary N1 drop. After running the QRH checklist, the engine was stable. I called the Flight Attendants and asked them if they saw or smelled anything abnormal in the cabin. They responded that everything seemed normal, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary, except for the actual compressor stall. We elected to climb to FL 230 and continue to assess what happened. I was in the process of typing an ACARS message to Dispatch when we were climbing through 15000 ft. The engine experienced another compressor stall at this time, and we immediately advised ATC and requested a return to ZZZ. As we made the turn towards the airport the number two engine EGT spiked into the red and the engine fail icon appeared. We performed the engine fire, severe damage QRC, followed by the QRH. We secured the engine. At this point I made a PA explaining the situation to the passengers and also talked to the Flight Attendants. Sent a quick ACARS message to Dispatch telling them we were single engine and returning to ZZZ. ATC coordinated crash and rescue equipment for Runway XXL. We landed on Runway XXL, had fire and rescue look over the aircraft once on the taxiway to make sure everything was ok outside before proceeding to the gate. PAs were made, keeping passengers informed on what was going on. Taxied to the gate.		On climb out around 8000 ft. we experienced multiple compressor stalls on the #2 engine. We observed significant fluctuations in N1. Did not note any EGT exceedance or engine over speed. Executed QRC items for engine surge, limit or stall. Leveled off at 10000 ft. Captain was the PM so they ran the checklist and then QRH. Upon completion of QRH, all indications were normal, so we decided to continue the climb and continue the flight to ZZZ1. Climbing through 15000 ft. we again experienced compressor stalls. I immediately reduced power and leveled at 16000. We advised ATC and began returning to ZZZ. We again followed the checklists except this time the engine EGT was in the red. We continued following the QRH which led us to shut down the engine. Upon completion of checklists and programming for the approach we exchanged flight controls. We landed on XXL without incident. We taxied off the runway and had the Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) crews inspect the engine. Once they gave us all clear we taxied to the gate and deplaned with no further issues.		B737-700 flight crew and Dispatcher reported multiple compressor stalls during climb required and engine shut down. Flight returned to the departure airport and landed normally.

It was my leg and I was pilot flying. We pushed back from gate in ZZZ at XA57, started both engines, complied with the procedures for MEL XX-XX-XX-X High Pressure Valve (HPV) (an open MEL on that aircraft), performed our checklist and taxied out to Runway XXL as instructed. At approximately XB08 we were first cleared to line up and wait, which we did and up to that point were without incident and/or any abnormalities. About 1 minute later we were then cleared for takeoff. We performed our normal task along with the required operational procedure in that MEL's 'BEFORE TAKE OFF UNTIL DECENT' section just before applying take off thrust. I announced 'takeoff' and began to push the thrust levers forward to the initial 50% N1 target. It was while doing so that I sensed that there was some sort of operational abnormality with one of the engines. I heard the sound of a muffled 'thud' to start with followed by the sound of an engine decreasing in rotation verses increasing as it should be. Simultaneously, and as I was verifying this on the engine indications, we were presented with an aural warning and the ENG 1 FAIL ECAM notification and associated actions. At that point we were roughly at a speed of just around 10 kts. I immediately rejected the takeoff, brought the aircraft to a stop, put the parking brake on and called for 'FLIGHT ATTENDANT STATIONS' over the PA. FO notified the Tower that we were aborting the takeoff. I then called for 'ECAM actions' and we proceeded through those. After preforming and clearing the ENG FAIL ECAM actions there was also an ENG 1 STALL ECAM alert and actions to follow. We performed and cleared those as well. Once all ECAM action were completed I made the triple 'REMAIN SEATED' call over the PA and then called to speak directly with the lead Flight Attendant (FA). I advised him that we had encountered an engine failure on the number 1 engine during the takeoff roll, that no other threats were perceived from our position, and that we would be taxiing back to the gate. He was in agreement and made it known that all was clear in the cabin to do so. After that call I requested FO to send an ACARS message to our Dispatcher advising him that we had encountered an engine failure and that we needed to return to the gate. As he was doing that I called Tower ATC to advise them of the same and requested taxi. ATC cleared us to taxi down XXL, to exit left on taxiway 1, to hold short of taxiway 2 and that he would assist us in getting an open gate to return to. After clearing the runway I made a PA announcement to the passengers that we were returning to the gate due to a mechanical issue. We were then cleared into the ramp by ATC. During the taxi we performed the After Landing flows, checklist, and received an ACARS response from our Dispatcher acknowledging our gate return. FO also called station operations over the radio informing them of our return and for gate coordination. We started the APU, parked the aircraft, shut down down ENG 2, and preformed the Parking Checklist. Once parked at the gate and after opening the cabin and cockpit door we were met by maintenance personnel. I briefly spoke with them, our lead FA, and the gate agent to ensure all was stable before calling our Dispatcher to discuss the incident, which I then proceeded to do. At the end of that conversation I asked to be transferred to Maintenance Control where I gave them the run down as well and discussed the logbook entries. I then called the Chief Pilot and explained the situation, and got the authorization to deplane the passengers. I coordinated that with station personnel and then asked Lead FA to make the deplaning announcement. At some point I was contacted by the Dispatch Coordinator on duty to get an understanding of the situation and to determine our fitness for duty. I told him I would discuss that with the rest of the crew and call him back with a decision. FO and I debriefed the situation amongst ourselves and I followed that with a debriefing with the flight attendants. It was unanimously determined that in the interest of safety it would not be the best course of action to continue on duty and to preform any possible subsequent flight(s). I reported that back to the Dispatch Coordinator, crew scheduling and Chief Pilot and we were all cleared to duty off.		Captain and I were working Aircraft X from ZZZ-ZZZZ. We pushed off of gate in ZZZ and planned for a two-engine taxi out to XXL/Taxiway 1 so we started both engines and completed the associated 'MEL XX-XX-XX-X High Pressure Valve (HPV)' procedure after engine start that Aircraft X had. We continued our taxi out to Runway XXL/Taxiway 1 as briefed and were number 1 for takeoff. Upon reaching the runway we had elapsed over 6 minutes on engine warmup and received a line up and wait clearance. I verified the runway heading and shortly after we were cleared for takeoff. Captain completed the MEL items and called for takeoff. Upon bringing the thrust up to roughly 50% N1, Captain began to notice an issue with the number 1 engine and began verbalizing it. As he was doing so, we received an ENG 1 Fail ECAM followed by an ENG 1 Stall ECAM in which he retarted the thrust levers to idle and called for a rejected takeoff. We were not even at 10 kts. when this happened. Captain stopped the aircraft and called 'flight attendant's stations' while I notified ZZZ Tower we were rejecting on Runway XXL. Once back together he called for ECAM actions in which we worked through the ENG 1 Fail ECAM procedure determining no damage was suspected. ZZZ Tower asked if we needed any assistance to which I replied 'standby' as we were working through the ECAM. We followed up with the ENG 1 Stall ECAM and Status page, after which Captain made the remain seated announcement then talked with the flight attendants. Captain then told ATC we had an Engine 1 failure and that we would be returning to the gate. We received taxi instructions to continue down Runway XXL, and taxi to the ramp. I coordinated a new gate with operations and sent a message to Dispatch informing them of our return to gate status. On the way back to gate we ran an after-landing checklist and continued into parking where Maintenance took over the aircraft.		A320 crew reported a muffled thud and indications of a decelerating engine followed by ENG 1 FAIL and ENG 1 STALL ECAM's as power was applied for takeoff.  Crew rejected the takeoff and returned to the gate after accomplishing ECAM items.

I was flying and had radios while the First Officer (FO) ran the checklist. We determined the #4; 11 spoilers failed in the unlocked position. I handed aircraft to FO and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance. We decided to divert to ZZZ, autopilot was disconnected and the aircraft was hand flown. Relief Pilot returned to the flight deck and figured out landing data for our malfunction. Overweight landing checklist was followed. Diversion guide was reviewed. Flight Attendants were notified and brief items were reviewed. Passengers were briefed. FO handed me the aircraft while being vectored to final. Normal flaps 30 landing ensued. Maintenance write ups included SPOILERS EICAS message, FLIGHT CONTROL SYS status message, spoilers failed, overweight landing, and RECIRC FAN status message. We were 62 miles from ZZZ when this happened. The crew did an exemplary job flying, managing tasks, advocating, and supporting me in every way. The relief pilot was fresh off IOE. Being woken up and returning to an priority in progress is challenging. They rose to the challenge and were an asset immediately accomplishing necessary tasks quickly and efficiently. The old timer of my crew with XX years on the 777, performed to the highest standard. They were instrumental in analyzing the situation, managing checklists, and then managing our descent into ZZZ while hand flying. Our purser was flying their first trip as a purser. Bless their heart, they could not believe this was happening but when I said Brief, they immediately knew what that meant and jumped into action professionally and effectively managing the crew and cabin. Overall I am very proud of this crew and honored to have had the privilege to work with them.				B777 Captain reported two flight spoilers deployed in the unlocked position during cruise.

We were instructed 170 KIAS until DEPOT. We held 170 until we saw the Airbus appeared at eight miles and slowing. We were warned of wake turbulence and started to experience wake from heavy. We slowed for safety reasons to give more separation. Due to ATC radio congestion, we could not tell Tower what was occurring. Tower asked us to speed up then instructed us to cancel approach and vectored us for a go-around. On Approach, I told them we did not appreciate being slammed in behind a heavy. Approach said we had 10 miles. I told Approach that we were experiencing wake turbulence and that we saw less than eight miles. Afterwords, normal approach and landing to Runway 28. Given the proper wake turn separation behind heavy aircraft. It's a safety issue. We were warned of wake turbulence and when we experienced we took proper action to safely handle aircraft.		As Pilot Flying, we were behind a heavy aircraft by approximately 10 miles that had requested to slow down. ATC assigned our speed to 210, followed by a further reduction to 170 until DEPOT. Established on the final for ILS PRM 27L, we were cleared for the approach and told caution for wake turbulence. We began to slow after feeling the wake turbulence. Tower had asked what our speed was and told 170 until DEPOT was needed. We were already slowed and configured and not able to fly the 170 knots. Tower canceled our approach clearance and vectored us off final, handing us off to Approach Control. Flying the aircraft, I maintained control and flew the assigned heading/altitude and we returned for a landing on Runway 28. I felt we were cleared to reduce airspeed prior to DEPOT, as we were too close  to the heavy aircraft wake, but Tower needed the airspeed until DEPOT. Better communication on both parts could have helped.		Air carrier flight crew reported slowing below ATC assigned speed following a wake turbulence encounter on approach to ATL.

Shortly after take-off, the Captain said 'Gear Up' and I went to retract the landing gear. Upon moving the gear handle, we received an ECAM of HYD G Eng 1 Pump Lo Pr and the landing gear and doors did not retract. The Captain put on the autopilot and we cleaned up the flaps and maintained an airspeed of 205 KIAS. We started to run the ECAM which had us turn off the green pump. Then I asked ATC to level off at 4000 ft. MSL and a heading while we ran a checklist. I turned the green pump back on to attempt to retract the landing gear, but after the system indicated no pressure, I turned the pump back off and left the gear down. We also checked the hydraulic page and noted that we had lost all fluid in the green system. At that time the Captain handed me the aircraft and radios while they worked in coordination with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. After conferring with Dispatch, I [requested priority handling] with ATC and notified them of our intention to return to ZZZ while the Captain continued to troubleshoot with Maintenance Control. I ran the HYD G Eng 1 Pump Lo Pr FM procedure, ran the landing distance tables, and built the box to an ILS to Runway YY, which was ZZZ's longest runway that supported the winds (250 @ 6 gusting 21). ATC began to give us vectors while I maintained an airspeed of 205 KIAS. Shortly thereafter the Captain got off the phone, informed me the flight controls would be slow to move, we had lost nose wheel steering, and thrust reversers on the left side, and would have to stop straight ahead on the runway.They talked to the passengers and Flight Attendants (FAs) to inform them of the situation, then asked me to run the overweight landing checklist, which I did. I also conferred with them on the L/G gravity extension checklist, which we did per the HYD G Eng 1 Lo Pr checklist. After that they reviewed the mission computer work I had done, looked at the approach, and briefed the procedures. I handed the aircraft back to them and I informed ATC we were ready for the approach and they set us up for a 25 mile straight in for the ILS to Runway YY. I ran the descent checklist, we configured the aircraft early due to slow flight control movement, and I ran the landing checklist. The Captain did a great, smooth landing on the runway and they brought us to a stop with the reversers in reverse idle. The Captain applied the brakes at 105 kts. and brought us to a stop abeam taxiway X. I asked Tower to have Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) check on the brakes to ensure they didn't overheat. I ran my normal after landing flow, we started the APU, the Captain talked to the passengers, and then we coordinated a tug with operations. We shut down the engines with the parking brake set and the Captain called the Chief Pilot to advise them of our situation and plan. The tug came and got us about 20 min later and pulled us back to the gate with no further issues. Upon arriving at the gate, the gate agent spoke to the passengers and deplaned the aircraft while we talked with maintenance.				A320 First Officer reported that the landing gear and doors did not retract after takeoff and the aircraft lost all fluid in the green hydraulic system. The flight crew left the gear extended and returned to the departure airport where after landing they were towed to the gate.

Flight XXX ZZZ1 to ZZZ. Cleared direct ZZZZZ (fix on ILS XXR, listed at 2800 ft.) descend to 4000 ft. I descend to 4000 ft, 7 miles from ZZZZZ with flaps 1 already extended. I slow from 240 KIAS to 180 KIAS (based on my math 10 kts. per mile). The Captain perceived that we were high. I was not concerned because I was following my 3:1 descent plan. At 3 miles from ZZZZZ I leveled off at 4000 ft. As I slow to 180 KIAS, I finally see the runway. Because we stopped the descent at 4000, we are high. I ask the Captain to ask for Approach Clearance, which they do. The Controller clears us for the approach, approximately 1 mile from ZZZZZ. This was too late of a clearance and without our prompt the Controller forgot to clear us. The Captain suggests asking for s turns, I think I am too high to fix this so I ask for a right 360. Captain relays this to the Controller. The Controller clears us to make a right 360 and descend to 2000 ft. This is too low of a clearance. During the right 360, about 2400 we get an 'Obstacle' aural alert. We climbed to 2800. We again ask for clearance and are cleared for the approach. We meet all stable approach gates and land normally.We had to prompt the Controller 3 times. I should have had the situational awareness that we would be high, I was so focused on my descent plan I did not take into account that the Controller might forget to clear us and by the time I asked the Captain to ask the Controller to clear us we were too high. The Captain exhibited excellent SA, he was aware that we were about to be high and helped point out the runway to me both times. The first error was the Controller did not clear us for the approach in time. The second error was that the Controller cleared us into an unsafe altitude that caused an obstacle aural alert. The error I made was not recognizing the impending high situation by trying to time the descent with no margin for error. The Captain exhibited strong SA the whole time and excellent CRM, he helped me respond to the obstacle quickly.		On arrival to from the North on the arrival ZZZ the Approach Controller gave us direct to ZZZZZ which is the FAF on the ILS XXR and maintain 4000. As we were approaching ZZZZZ we were gear down and flaps 15 and it appeared that we were starting to become high as the GS altitude at ZZZZZ is 2770. We were still at 4000 and the Controller forgot to give us a clearance. As we were receiving our visual approach clearance we were now too high to make a straight in from ZZZZZ at 4000. We requested a 360 degree turn to lose altitude. The Controller approved a right 360 and maintained 2000. As we were halfway through the 360 descending through 2500, we received an 'Obstacle' warning and immediately began correcting until the warning stopped at 2800. We rejoined the localizer and were cleared the visual and landed meeting all the stabilized approach criteria.		B737 flight crew reported receiving a late visual approach clearance from ATC resulting in the aircraft being high for a stabilized approach, then also receiving a EGPWS obstacle alert warning when descending to the ATC assigned altitude. The flight crew climbed back to the correct altitude and continued the approach to landing.

It was the Captain's leg to fly. He noticed that every time he stopped using the electric trim, it instantly started trimming in the opposite direction. The Captain instinctively ran the memory items, and explained to me what was happening; then asked me to run the QRH. I asked ATC for vectors back to ZZZ, and ran the checklist. We returned to ZZZ with no further incident.		Upon flap retraction, a runaway stabilizer occurred. We did not fully realize it was occurring until final flap retraction, and the wing was clean. We eliminated the runaway by completing the memory item, and cutting out the Stab Trim switches. We completed the checklist and returned to ZZZ uneventfully.

We continued to descend through 6900 ft. when we received a traffic call from ATC. The Controller indicated that the traffic was at 10 o'clock at around 5500 ft. and climbing. They told us to level off immediately. They spoke quickly so I was not sure what they said. I asked for confirmation that they wanted us to level off. They confirmed and we then received a TA. The First Officer (FO) Pilot flying (PF) leveled off and announced 'TCAS I have control'. We immediately received an RA with the RA order 'Monitor Vertical Speed'. We followed the procedure for an RA, both announcing 'Autopilot off, flight directors off.' The FO disengaged the autopilot and I turned off the flight directors. My Navigation Display (ND) displayed a red traffic symbol at -3 at almost the same location as our Own Ship symbol. I looked out my window and saw the traffic, a high wing prop aircraft, passing below us at about 300 ft. below our altitude. At this point we were at approximately 6300 ft. After a few seconds we received a 'Clear of Traffic' call from the TCAS system. I told the Controller that we had received an RA. They told us that the traffic was not a factor and cleared us directly to ZZZZZ2 to cross at 4100 ft. and were cleared for the ILS XX approach. The rest of the flight proceeded normally.				A320 Captain reported an NMAC event during initial approach. The flight crew complied with the TCAS RA until clear of conflict and proceeded normally.

My airspeed rolled back quickly. (below 170 knots). Airplane went into control wheel steering. IAS disagree was enunciated. I looked over at the FO's primary flight display and she was near redline. Our altitudes disagreed by nearly 3,000 feet. I knew immediately it was airspeed unreliable. Performed recall and QRC items. I was in a descent in IMC so I set the N1 to 80% and pitch to 4 degrees. Asked ATC for a block altitude. Also verified my altitude and ground speed with ATC continuously. After performing QRC and QRH it was determined that my side was the erroneous side. Assigned flying duties to the FO. I [requested priority handling] and chose ZZZ1 as a diversion destination instead of ZZZ2. Completed non routine landing considerations and safely landed in ZZZ1. On a side note: I would like to take this opportunity to commend our training department. I have practiced this exact scenario in the sim and it played out in real life virtually the same. Because it was practiced in the sim my startle factor was not nearly as high. Cause - Mechanical malfunction.Suggestions - Nothing could have prevented this. After speaking with maintenance it was determined that the #1 ADIRU failed.				B737-800 Captain reported an air data computer failure causing erratic and conflicting readings of airspeed and altitude between the Captain and First Officer's flight instruments. The Captain determined via checklist that the failed instruments were on the Captain side and assigned flying duties to the FO. The FO maintained the flight manual pitch and attitude guidelines, validated airspeed and altitude with ATC, and diverted to a longer runway airport. The flight landed safely at the alternate airport.

I looked down at the engine instruments and saw the #1 Engine N1 indication abnormal with limits exceeded. My initial thought was engine severe damage. It was louder than anything I've experienced in the simulator. It sounded like a gunshot went off in the cockpit.I was the Pilot Flying so the autopilot disconnected. After regaining control and trimming it somewhat, I called for the Engine Fire or Engine Severe Damage or Separation checklist. The First Officer ran this checklist, and advised ATC for us. We asked ATC for 9000 ft. There were thunderstorms in the area and ZZZ Departure turned us north initially followed by an extended downwind. The plan was for landing on runway XXR.After the #1 Engine was shut down, we followed up with the QRH. I made a PA to the Passengers/Flight Attendants telling them we had a mechanical issue, and we were returning to ZZZ. I told them there would be some fire trucks moving around us on the runway. I wanted everyone to remain seated after we landed.  Due to a thunderstorm ahead of us, ATC vectored us onto a base leg followed by a final turn for XXR. At that point, we needed more time to finish running our QRH procedure and told ATC. They continued us upwind again. We remained close to the airport in night VMC conditions. After the next turn to a downwind with the QRH items mostly completed, we felt ready for a turn inbound for landing. They offered us XXL as an option. I was more comfortable with XXR as there was a NOTAM for XXL, I can't remember the exact issue. XXR felt more comfortable for me as a landing runway so we decided to stick with that. Normal ops for landing in ZZZ is XXR as I have landed on it many times and was more familiar with the taxiway exit points, etc.We landed Flaps 15 with autobrakes 3. I saw the fire trucks near the end of the runway. I deactivated the autobrakes and rolled down to where they were. The First Officer communicated with CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) as they inspected the aircraft on the runway. We decided to remain on the runway as there was more space for CFR to move around the aircraft. While this was being done, I made another PA to the back emphasizing to stay seated as the CFR completed their inspection. CFR stated the aircraft appeared fine. The First Officer ran the brake cooling numbers. The results showed we were good to go to gate.  Initially, we were assigned Gate X. From my former experience taxiing into that gate while at (other carrier), I wasn't comfortable pulling into Gate X with the #1 Engine shut down. If they marshaled us to a stop prior to my initial turn toward the jetway, I was worried about making that hard right turn without the #1 Engine running from a stopped position. Sometimes this would require differential power, mainly from the #1 Engine. We had them change the gate to Y.We pulled into gate normally. We shut down. A brief conversation with the Flight Attendants... they said they knew what happened due to the loud bang. I apologized for not specifically briefing them. At the time, I figured my Passenger briefing had covered them as well. ZZZ Maintenance Personnel met us. I briefed them on what happened. Then called Dispatch for a briefing with (Company) Maintenance, Dispatcher, Chief Pilot on call. I entered two write-ups in logbook, one for engine issue and another for overweight landing. The operations Chief Pilot pulled the rest of our flying, and we went to hotel.If I could do it again, I would have gotten the autopilot on.  I ended up hand flying the entire time.  I'm not sure why I did this. In the sim, getting that autopilot on is the first thing I'd do when given the chance in that situation. This would have let me take some of the workload off the First Officer. It is a resource I had that I simply didn't use that really would have helped. I cannot emphasize how much having an experienced First Officer really helped me.		While climbing through 8000 ft. on the ZZZZ Departure out of ZZZ, we experienced a failure of the #1 Engine. The failure manifested with a very loud 'BOOM' accompanied by an immediate role back of N2. It was much louder and more violent than engine failures I had experienced in the simulator.The Captain was quick to get on the controls and stabilize the aircraft when the failure occurred. I immediately went out to ZZZ Departure and requested a level off and told them that we would be returning to ZZZ. There were severe thunderstorms surrounding ZZZ, but the field was clear. Once we were stabilized at 9000 ft. on a vector away from weather, I got the APU started and we ran the  ENGINE FIRE or Engine Severe Damage or Separation Checklist. Once completed, I advised ATC and then began running the QRH procedures. While running the QRH we were switched to Approach Control, and we requested vectors for the ILS XXR. Approach put us in a right downwind on the north side of the field. We required a few extra turns to buy us more time to complete our checklists and to avoid another cell of thunderstorms. Once we had a handle on the checklists and had our plan in place, I updated the Flight Attendants of the situation and the Captain gave a PA to the Passengers. When we got down to the deferred items we requested vectors to final XXR. When selecting Flaps 15, we noticed the Vref was wrong and that I had not updated the aircraft weight to reflect the return to ZZZ. We were heavier than what was previously calculated. We adjusted on final and dialed the speed up to Vref15 +5. The Captain made a smooth touchdown and brought it to stop on the runway. I switched over to VHF#2 and began communicating with Fire Rescue. They inspected the #1 Engine and we had them keep an eye on the brakes while I ran the Brake Cooling data. With no abnormalities visible to Fire Rescue and no cooling period required for brakes, we taxied to the gate.Overall, I feel our Crew coordination was strong on this flight. We communicated clearly to one another, and we were always on the same page. We flowed through the checklists and procedures efficiently as a team.		B737-700 flight crew reported an engine failure after takeoff, identified with a loud boom, resulting in a return to the departure airport with ATC assistance.

There was a 'bang.' Jet yawed to the left. First Officer (F/O) said 'We just lost #1.' I replied, 'I have the aircraft, Engine Failure Checklist'. I then keyed the MIC, informing Center that we'd lost #1 Engine and needed to return to ZZZ. I [requested priority]. We ran appropriate checklists, returned to ZZZ for uneventful single-engine landing.		I was the Pilot Flying on Flight XXXX to ZZZ. On climbout with the autopilot and auto throttles on, at roughly FL 230 the Crew heard a bang noise. I vocalized the engine failure and the engine temperature in the red, as we felt a yaw with the aircraft. With the autopilot now off, we transferred the controls to the Captain. We had been deviating around some weather and climbing in and out of clouds. However, I do not remember if the anti-ice was on or off as we were climbing out of the surrounding clouds at that point. We [requested priority], ran the QRC/QRH and all applicable checklist and performance. With the engine secured, we returned to ZZZ and landed on Runway XXR. We were met on the ground by the fire department who visually inspected our left engine from their vehicle. We were located at the run up pad off XXR and were given the all clear so after the break cooling requirement was met, we taxied to the gate and deplaned the passengers. All engine indications and parameters were normal to my knowledge up to the point of engine failure. We had a Company simulator instructor on our Jumpseat (30+ year other carrier Pilot) who noticed the EGT reading over 940 degrees C. I do not recall a specific temperature. Upon inspection on the ground, the failure appeared to be contained inside the cowling.		Air carrier flight crew reported the number one engine failure during initial climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

We were behind another heavy and experienced plus 15 / minus 15 in airspeed with some light turbulence at 1500 ft. 6 DME. I assumed wake turbulence and started to slow a bit and tried to go a bit above glideslope to mitigate. I did not communicate this with Tower because of the aviate, navigate, then communicate order of priority. Anyway we slowed a bit early and were given landing clearance at 500 ft. as the aircraft ahead of us barely had cleared the runway. So for me as our stable approach criteria has airspeed deviation limitations, I was concerned we would not be stable with our plus 15 minus 15 airspeed variations on final which the autothrottle was struggling to keep up with. In retrospect I should have told ATC I was slowing to mitigate wake turbulence and maintain a stable approach.				B777 Captain reported experiencing wake turbulence and deviating from assigned airspeed to mitigate the effects and maintain a stable approach without informing ATC of intentions.

We taxied back to an available apron area to contact Dispatch and Maintenance Control to work on the issue.  After conferring with Maintenance Control we cycled the circuit breakers that Maintenance Control instructed us to cycle.  This did not fix the problem.  Upon further research Maintenance Control informed us that the issue could be deferred.  A deferral [was] made and a new release was sent to the aircraft.An uneventful takeoff and initial departure was made.Just prior to level off, the SPD LIM indication in the Captain's PFD was noticed to illuminate occasionally but only for a brief period of a couple-of-seconds.Level off at cruise altitude of 34,000 feet was uneventful.  All other indications and instruments were working properly, including all primary and secondary airspeed instruments.  As a precaution, we reviewed immediate action items, and follow on procedures of 'AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE' checklist.  At this time the only non-normal indications were a single channel AUTO SLAT FAIL light when the Master Caution recall was checked, and a very seldom intermittent SPD LIM  flag only on the Captain's PFD.  The First Officer was already the pilot flying so we continued with these flying positions.Once we were over the X area, the SPD LIM light illuminated more often and for longer periods of time.  It was more steady on, than off.  Soon thereafter we experienced a very brief (less than two seconds) 'stick shaker', and very soon thereafter the Captain's PFD intermittently displayed brief over speed indications.  We again reviewed the Flight Manual and checklist for 'Unreliable Airspeed.'  At this point all of the First Officer's instruments were normal, all airspeed indicators agreed.We again contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and discussed the malfunction.  No resolution or fix was offered by Maintenance Control so the flight crew conferred and decided to divert.  After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance Control on the best divert options, ZZZ1 chosen.  As the flight continued to ZZZ1, all intermittent issues became more frequent.An uneventful visual approach and landing was made on Runway XXL at ZZZ1, followed by taxi to an available gate.  After maintenance made an initial assessment of the issues, it was decided by Customer Service, Maintenance, and Ramp to deplane the passengers and accommodate them all on a later flight to ZZZ.The only frustrating issue during the entire event was the fact that multiple ATC agencies (multiple Center controls as well as Approach Control) did not pass on to each other that we had [priority handling] and were an '[priority handling] aircraft!'  Center even tried to vector us north of ZZZ1 for 'at least 4 minutes!'I may not have initially checked onto the frequency as a [priority handling] aircraft, and not until I told Center that the vectors were unacceptable and that we were a [priority handling] did we receive priority handling.  Center apologized and said they had not been informed.  The same thing happened with Approach Control.The only thing I would have changed in this scenario was to ensure I used the label [priority handling] to ensure priority each and every transmission to ATC.				B737 NG Captain reported they received intermittent SPD LIM and AUTO SLAT FAIL warnings at cruise altitude.  The warnings became steady and soon after the crew experienced a stick shaker and an over speed indication displayed on the Captain's side.  The flight crew decided to divert to the nearest suitable airport.

I was able to provide verbal corrections with adequate response from the FO during the transition to land and landing, right up until about 20-30 feet. He had set an adequate pitch attitude to complete the landing safely, but then released back pressure and induced a sink rate from which I was unable to recover from in a timely manner, leading to a suspected hard landing. We also got a report from the gate agent after deplaning that a passenger was complaining of a hurt neck/back due to the impact of the landing.This was the second leg of my Operational Evaluation (OE) sequence (first with FO as PF, I was PF on the first leg) with the new hire FO. He had three other OE sequences before this one, with landings still needing improvement. I was definitely caught off guard with the FO's actions at 20-30 feet as I had not seen this before that low to the ground.  The FO's previous flying experience, specifically the type of airplane, before coming could be a causal factor, as well as 5 days off since his previous OE sequence. I need to be more ready for this kind of control input low to the ground from now on. FO did have 5 days off between his last OE sequence and our sequence, so reducing the time between OE sequences might have helped.		On this IOE training flight, I (FO) was the flying pilot for the leg. On touchdown into ZZZ I conducted a hard landing. After flight passenger complained about back hurting. Sight picture for flaring is weak and developing. Additionally all previous aircraft flown have had much lower flare sight pictures. Not picking up on audible cueing (ie. pace of radar altimeter call outs below 50 feet). Low hours and landings (26 hours, 7th landing). Aggressive pitch changes below 200 feet. Low hour FO with significant amount of time between flights / landings. First 4 landings in 8 days, then 13 days no flights or landings. Then 2 landings followed by 6 days off. Event occurred on first flying leg after previous 6 days off.Suggestions - Additional training for FOs. Minimize time between training flights and line flights for low hour FOs.		Air carrier flight crew reported a hard landing during a training flight resulted when the trainee released back pressure during the round out. A passenger reported a sore back due to the impact.

We informed Tower that we were ready and were cleared for takeoff. On the roll and above 80 kts, we received the following transmission from Tower, 'Aircraft X, cancel takeoff clearance' in an unsure tone.  The unusual nature of that direction led me to question and replay it in my head before acting on it.  My Captain said something similar later as we debriefed, but he still began the abort very quickly and we reached about 100 kts before slowing. Exited the runway and returned to the gate for a maintenance inspection and brake cooling period. Our Dispatcher not knowing that we had received our closeout despite the fact that I believe he has access to all of our ACARS messages. Even if that's not the case, to cause a high speed abort for a paperwork issue seems to me to be misplaced priorities leading to an erosion of safety.  This could have been handled very easily and much more safely in the air.  Additionally, given the dynamic nature of a takeoff roll, a more assertive abort call from the Tower Controller would likely have saved us some time and thus a few knots of speed. A few seconds later, it might have been quite critical. Better communication between different parts of our operation would have prevented the abort, and a more assertive abort call from Tower would have made the abort safer.		The Captain initially contacted me stating that the restricted article was not declared in the initial load closeout for this flight. The aircraft was holding short of the runway when he contacted me. I immediately contacted the load agent who stated that he was waiting for the Crew Chief to call him and give him the details so he can correct the load closeout to send out a revision. I then contacted ZZZ OPS and was told that the manager was trying to get in touch with the crew chief. I also notified the unit coordinator and a sector manager about the ongoing issue. Approximately 10 minutes were spent trying to coordinate this issue while I continually refreshed the weight and balance input to see if a load closeout revision was sent out but I did not see one. Simultaneously, I noticed that the aircraft was getting on the runway and I subsequently called the ATC Tower to cancel the takeoff clearance. The crew aborted the takeoff and later confirmed that they were approximately 100 knots when they aborted the takeoff. Aircraft went back to the gate to get inspected by the local maintenance. [Caused by] the incorrect load closeout that was sent out with no restricted articles (R/A) listed and difficulty to get in touch with the crew chief who worked the flight to notify him of the error. An automated and immediate forwarding of load closeouts to the screen printer of every flight assigned to a dispatch desk, including R/A information of flights would be very helpful.		B737-800 First Officer reported a high speed abort was executed due to a miscommunication of multiple parts of the ground operation regarding a DG document.

I asked if there was any smoke or fire. They said there wasn't but the smell was very strong and not dissipating at all. At this point I made the decision to request priority handling and divert to ZZZ. We turned around and started down and ran all of our checklist including the overweight landing checklist.  The I reached out again to the FAs and said I needed to know if any smoke started appearing at all. They said they would. They were given a priority code and we prepped for landing. Unfortunately with all that was going on I failed to notice they turned us in about 5 miles closer then I expected.  Due to this we ended up being much to high for the landing. Since we didn't have an actual fire at this point I felt it was safer to go around instead of forcing a bad landing.  We went around and then came back for a smooth overweight landing.  After landing we stopped on the high speed and I had the fire trucks position behind us and look for any signs.  I had the aft FA go back into the lav to check again.The strong electrical smell and the heat continued with no reduction in intensity. I told the Airport Rescue and Firefighting to stay close and follow us in as I felt it was safer at this point to deplane normally. I told them if we got any indication of smoke we would immediately stop and evacuate.  We got to the gate and again I felt it safer to remove all passengers thru the Jetway and then have the firemen inspect the lav. Upon inspection they found the water heater to be at fault and basically running away as hot as it would go. It was so hot that the hot water coming out was 130 degrees and even the cold water was 108 degrees. For reference the other lav showed 80 hot water. The end result was a safe landing with no evacuation needed. I did make the mistake of not realizing we were as close as we were so ultimately the only thing I would have done different would have been to verify how far out we were being vectored.  In the future I will attempt to look at that more closely. However a very strong mitigating factor was the possibility of this turning into a fire. Ultimately it did not luckily.				Air carrier Captain reported cabin odor and walls in the aft lavatory were extremely hot, as reported by the aft Flight Attendant. After a divert, a missed approach due to arriving too high on final and then an overweight landing, the aircraft arrived safely. The Fire Marshal and maintenance determined the aft water heater was running uncontrolled full power and overheating.

As we entered the runway, I told the FO (First Officer) I would do a rolling takeoff. As we rolled down the runway something caught my eye. A message on the PFD (primary flight display) 'airspeeds disagree'. The FO did not call '80 knots' yet. I retarded the throttles to idle and to my surprise the auto brakes became active. I was about to use reverse thrust, but the deceleration was too fast. I stowed the ground spoiler at taxi speed to release the auto brakes, and we cleared the runway. I made a public address to the passengers. I told the FO it must be considered a high speed abort since the auto brakes become active at 90 knots and the airplane would require an inspection. The FO contacted operations and maintenance. I checked the brake cooling chart and determined we were in the cooling recommended zone. As we went to a gate, I told the FO to shutdown engine 1 to avoid further heating of the brakes. Maintenance met as at the gate.We were probably about to go through 80 knots when the message appeared. In the time it took to analyze the message and bring the throttles to idle we must have been at 90 knots.				B737-800 Captain reported executing a rejected takeoff due to airspeed disagree message on primary flight display. Captain returned to gate for maintenance and brake cooling.

We pieced together our knowledge of what would help us land safely in ZZZ1 not knowing if it was a main or nose tire blown. landed on long runway, had emergency vehicles check for any aircraft damage before taxiing back to gate.		After departing ZZZ Runway XX we got a report of a possible blown tire from the tower.  We had already begun to clean up the aircraft so the decision was made to continue to ZZZ1.  While en-route to ZZZ1 we consulted with approach and referred to the QRH and AOM for guidance.  Decision was made to declare an emergency and have Airport Rescue and Firefighting standing by in ZZZ1.  Flew an ILS to Runway XXL and the landing was uneventful.  Airport Rescue and Firefighting inspected the aircraft and followed us to the gate.Consider adding more detailed guidance to the QRH and AOM with regard to operating with a blown tire.

The clearance was 'Load new route to ZZZZZ rest of route unchanged, due to weather.' The second page had dashes, then ZZZ2 XXX/XXY ZZZZZ./.ZZZ. The First Officer and I discussed it, loaded ZZZZZ in the LEGS 1 Page, and executed the route with LNAV engaged. We thought we were cleared directly to ZZZZZZ for weather buildups around the ZZZ2 XXX/XXY fix. After about 10 minutes, as I came back to flight intercom after coordinating with the flight attendants, the First Officer informed me ATC wanted us to fly to the ZZZ2 XXX/XXY fix and then ZZZZZ. I reprogrammed the FMC and executed the route. It was then, after further discussion, that we realized we should have flown to the ZZZ2 fix and then ZZZZZ. By then, the weather was dissipating, so there were no weather threats in the area. There also were no known traffic conflicts either. We then flew an uneventful arrival, approach, and landing into ZZZ.First, I had not seen a radial and DME fix in a CPDLC reroute in a long time, I believe. My expectation bias led me to think the re-route to ZZZZZ was for weather at that fix, and that led me and the First Officer to agree on direct ZZZZZ. But, as I discovered after we realized our error, if I had used the load function of CPDLC instead of the manual direct function, the ZZZ2 fix and ZZZZZ would have loaded in sequence. But because I misinterpreted the CPDLC message as the re-route was for weather around the ZZZ2 fix, that led me to my error. The First Officer and I discussed that next time we would query ATC in a similar situation, to make sure our interpretation was correct, plus the load function is best versus plugging the point(s) directly into the LEGS page (even though the abeam points, if used, would disappear). I am certain if ATC had verbally given us the en route change, we would have executed it with no issues, so this situation taught me a good lesson to adhere to our procedures and query ATC if there is any issue, plus to balance the written CPDLC reroute clearance with both of our expectations to make sure we comply with ATC's instructions.				Air carrier Captain reported misunderstanding of a CPDLC course reroute received in cruise and manually loading the clearance instead of using the load function resulted in a course deviation.

It was a 3-leg day, starting in ZZZ with a short flight to ZZZ, continuing to ZZZ1, and eventually ending at ZZZ2. On our arrival into ZZZ1, the ATIS showed a 10-knot tail wind, to which the Captain and I felt was in our best interest to request a more suitable runway, which would give us the least risk of landing in ZZZ1. This was our mentality the entire trip. Take it slow, make good decisions using our risk analysis model, and CRM. The winds in ZZZ1 were swirling around that day, as we landed on XXR versus XYL. Upon arrival at the gate, I did my walkaround and noticed a screw in the left main inboard tire. I notified the Captain, and he contacted Maintenance. It was determined that we would need a tire change. This, of course, caused our delay for departure to ZZZ2. The winds were still gusty, but nothing out of limitations, so we taxied to XYR for departure. The original ATIS, at time of pushback, was showing variable at 5 to 6 knots. However, just prior to lining up, the winds were now a gusty crosswind from the left. I was Pilot Monitoring (PM), and we were cleared for takeoff. The Pilot Flying (PF) applied the correct crosswind correction on the takeoff roll, and I made the appropriate takeoff callouts. At Vr, the PF rotated at a normal rate, to approximately 10 degrees. Immediately after, the aircraft pitched up more aggressively, before the main wheels were off the runway. The mains then lifted, and we both heard a thump. I believed the tail had struck. We continued the cleanup sequence, and we were handed to Departure. It was a busy time, as we were given a climb via, which had the low altitude hold-down, but then we were immediately given a vector from the Departure and altitude changes off the departure for traffic. Once the workload began to decrease, we were able to discuss the takeoff, as well as take a call from the Flight Attendants, who said they heard the sound of metal, as well as the feeling of hitting a speed bump. At this point the Captain transferred controls and contacted Maintenance in ZZZ1 to confirm how to locate on the document page of the FMC for the pitch, to determine tail strike. We were still unable to find the Pitch selection from ZZZ1 Maintenance. We leveled off at an intermediate altitude and ran the QRH and monitored pressurization. The Captain and I discussed the need to patch in with Dispatch and Maintenance via ARINC for a diversion plan. He was patched through and discussed a plan of action and options for diversion to either ZZZ1 or ZZZ3. We both agreed after looking at equal distances from either airport, that ZZZ3 was the better option with the winds showing three-knots and a long runway. This would also allow us to land under max landing weight. The diversion was confirmed with Dispatch and received via ACARS. The Captain notified the Passengers as to the plan as well as the Flight Attendants. The new route was put in, and the diversion checklist was completed. All normal checklists were complied with as well. Flight controls were then transferred to the Captain, and the briefings for ZZZ3 were completed, as well as the PM coordinating with ATC for lower altitudes to ensure fuel burn to be under max landing weight for landing. The longest runway was requested (XY), and a smooth min breaking touchdown was accomplished. We taxied to Gate XXX, to be met by Maintenance, Operations Agent, and Assistant Chief Pilot. Maintenance notified us that there was a tail strike, but the cartridge was in the green band, and the shoe was scraped and would only need to be repainted for the aircraft to be returned to service.		Aircraft pushed following short delay for tire-swap (screw imbedded in tire found by First Officer (FO) during walkaround). Captain was Pilot Flying (PF). Weather was VMC, winds were left crosswind with gusts to 24. Once cleared, normal takeoff roll with slight left yoke deflection to counter crosswind. PF rotated the aircraft at Vr at normal rate of pitch change. During liftoff Captain/FO felt vibration at near simultaneous main gear lifting from runway surface. Continued clean up and initial climb out per SID. Following 10,000 ft. announcement by Flight Attendants (FA), chimes from Cabin Crew were made and Captain responded. FA's stated that they had heard a metallic scrape during takeoff.  Captain and FO suspected possible tail strike during takeoff based on flight deck observations and FA input. In order to further confirm suspected strike, flight deck Crew attempted to access pitch angle during takeoff data in order to crosscheck aircraft data. As no appropriate data was located within ACARS or ACMS, Captain contacted ZZZ1 Maintenance on station frequency to attempt to verify onboard data for takeoff pitch for further verification. Captain was informed by Maintenance that this data was not available after aircraft becomes airborne. Finding that no other means were available to confirm the tail strike, flight deck Crew coordinated an intermediate level off and commenced the QRH Checklist for tail strike during takeoff. The flight deck Crew observed the cabin differential in the mid-range level and was functioning properly with normal rates. The FO was passed control of aircraft and continued to communicate with ATC.  Captain contacted Dispatch through ARINC to discuss return or diversion. Dispatch remained on patch while flight crew finalized assessments and weighed risks of identified options. The Flight Crew commenced discussion of return to ZZZ1 or diversion. The flight deck Crew prioritized landing with lowest possible airframe stress. All available information to execute this course of action was considered. Although not out of limits, the winds at ZZZ1 were less favorable than ZZZ3. ZZZ3 was reporting calm winds, had multiple long runways, and the need to burn down fuel below MLGW were present with either option. ZZZ3 location was also equally suitable as it offered an extensive maintenance presence, and robust Passenger re-accommodations, as well as additional flight deck and In-flight Crew Personnel.  After thoroughly considering the best course of action, the two locations were nearly equal in distance, time and fuel burn and the aircraft was still above its MLGW.  Per the QRH, Captain made decision to divert to ZZZ3 as the nearest suitable airport (checklist complete). The Diversion Checklist was then continued. Diversion was coordinated with Dispatch, and data/plan was received from Dispatch via ACARS. Captain confirmed with Dispatch that the landing would not be overweight. As the FO coordinated the diversion with ATC and subsequent routing and lower altitudes to assist fuel burn to ZZZ3, the Captain informed the Flight Attendants of the aircraft status and decision to divert. The Passengers were then addressed via PA and notified of diversion. Diversion checklist was complete. As the aircraft continued to descend, the flight deck Crew reevaluated pressurization and Captain determined the pressurization would remain in the AUTO schedule to ensure the most advanced scheduling was available to protect the aircraft and Passengers during high Air Crew task loading in rising terrain environment. The Captain's intent was to not exacerbate a possible existent condition (tail strike) with the potential of a manual control error of too rapidly depressurizing the cabin while above 10,000 ft. MSL. This error would have likely yielded Passenger discomfort and possible injury.  FO returned controls to Captain.  Captain completed arrival, approach, and landing (runway exit) briefings. Descent and Approach Checklists were completed. To reduce structural loads on touchdown, the Captain made a Flaps 30 landing, at minimal descent rate, using minimal required brake pressure and long rollout, at less than MLGW on Runway XX. Taxied to gate.Immediate coordination with Station Personnel that were standing by began upon shutdown (Asst Chief Pilot, Maintenance, Operations Agent, Customer Service Agent, In-flight supervisor).  Captain conducted a face-to-face brief with Maintenance and an inspection commenced. Maintenance inspected aircraft and informed Captain that a tail strike had indeed occurred but there was no significant damage although bare metal was visible on a portion of the shoe. The cartridge was also deemed serviceable as the green band was visible. An appropriate logbook entry was made by the Captain, signed off by Maintenance and OK to continue. The aircraft then continued immediately to ZZZ2. The Captain departed aboard subject aircraft as a DH Passenger to ZZZ2 where he then contacted Dispatch per FOM chapter.To avoid future incidents of tail strike Air Crew should be vigilant in ensuring proper rotation rate is achieved regardless of winds or other dynamics that would affect pitch rate during takeoff.		B737-800 flight crew reported a tail strike occurred during takeoff in gusty wind conditions. Flight crew diverted and post flight inspection found minor damage.

It was my First Officer's leg and the ZZZ Tower cleared us for take-off. After we taxied onto the runway and completed the below the line section of the Before Take-off Checklist, I asked my First Officer if he wanted it on the roll. He confirmed that he did and the take-off roll was initiated. I called thrust set and upon reaching 80 kts, I called 80 kts. My First Officer was silent. After about a second or two (at about 90 kts), I quickly glanced at him and realized he looked confused. I then looked at his airspeed indicator and noticed it said 40 kts. I immediately initiated the abort at that exact same moment my First Officer said, 'My airspeed doesn't look right.' The spoilers deployed and MAX auto-brakes engaged. The aircraft was stopped and I told the passengers on the PA to remain seated. We cleared the runway and stopped, and I had my First Officer roll the trucks just in case the hot brakes would've ignited. The ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) vehicle told us that the brakes were hot, but there was no smoke or fire present. I called Dispatch and Maintenance Control to advise them of what happened. Maintenance agreed that we needed to go back to the gate. My First Officer coordinated for a gate with Operations and the ARFF vehicles chose to follow us to Gate X. The aircraft was shutdown, the Parking Checklist was accomplished and a maintenance logbook entry was made. There is nothing that I can think of that I would've done differently.		Normal SOP until take-off power was applied. I applied 50 percent first, released the breaks, and positioned the thrust levers at the climb detent. At the 80 kts call out from the PM (Pilot Monitoring); I looked at my airspeed and hesitated. My airspeed was at 40 kts with a positive trend vector. Due to the hesitation, the PM looked at my PFD to verify. I said, 'this doesn't look right.' At that point the Captain (PM) took control of the aircraft and completed the rejected take-off procedure. I estimate that the procedure was started at about 90 kts. Once the airplane came to a stop, I informed the Tower that we had aborted the take-off roll and that we can taxi off the runway. We did request to have the airplane/ breaks inspected by ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting). Our highest break temperature was at 405 [degrees] C. After a few minutes, we returned to the gate. Maintenance performed several tests and concluded that the ADR 2 was faulty. We swapped airplanes and continued to ZZZ with about a 4.5 hour delay.

When following the Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM) procedure for the disagreement through FL210 we got an Adivsory indication flashing on the E/WD. The ENG page was up on the SD and QTY was flashing. The oil quantity was quickly decreasing from 3 qts. Within a few seconds while looking up the ECAM Advisory for oil quantity, I started noticing the oil pressure had decreased from 44 psi then started fluctuating from 30 psi to 25 psi and then started quickly dropping. The oil quantity indications had dropped and amber xx's replaced the indication. Within a few seconds the oil pressure dropped below red line and the Master Warning with repetitive chime came on. ECAM ENG 2 Low Oil PR appeared. We then proceeded to follow the ECAM actions. The ECAM directed us to shut down ENG 2. We then went through each secondary failure listed with the engine shutdown. After the engine was secured and preliminary ECAM actions were completed we stopped ECAM, leveled off at our assigned altitude of FL230 and I contacted ATC [requesting priority handling] due to having to shut down ENG 2. I requested to divert to ZZZ due to the facilities available and the longer runways. While talking to ATC the First Officer (FO) talked to the lead Flight Attendant (FA). ATC directed us to fly heading 150 and descend to 13,000 ft. We then ran the approach checklist and set the plane up for approach into ZZZ. The FO ran the landing performance for single engine Runway XXC. I requested Runway XXC due to the length of the runway. While I was flying and talking to ATC the FO was going through the FCOM procedure for ENG Low Oil PR ECAM. I made an announcement to the passengers that we had to shutdown the engine due to a mechanical issue and were diverting to ZZZ. I asked the passengers to remain seated and we would update them once we landed in ZZZ. I requested vectors for the RNAV XXC. While descending, the FO continued going through the overweight landing checklist and then the single engine straight in approach checklist. After the checklist were completed, we requested vectors to the approach. We landed normally with no issues and then taxied off the runway under our own power. We performed the after landing checklist and turned on the brake fans as instructed by the overweight landing checklist. I stopped on the taxiway just clear of the runway and emergency personnel drove around the aircraft and checked the #2 engine. The emergency personnel reported back that the #2 engine was leaking fluid. We were then instructed by ground to taxi into the ramp area and they wanted us to go to Gate XXX.		Shortly after passing FL180 we received NAV LS Disagree ECAM. After that was resolved Advisory was flashing and our engine oil quantity indicator was flashing. We began loosing quantity and pressure then the ECAM Eng 2 Oil Low Pressure displayed along with the master warning and received repetitive chimes. We followed the ECAM instructions which instructed us to shutdown the engine. After running the ECAM we followed the Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM) procedures for ENG 1(2) OIL LO PR followed by ENG 1(2) SHUT DOWN, QRH One Engine inoperative straight in approach and QRH Overweight landing. We [requested priority handling] early on and committed to landing at ZZZ for the longer runway due to being single engine and overweight.		A320 flight crew reported the R Engine on was shutdown inflight because of a loss of oil quantity and pressure. The pilots successfully diverted to a nearby airport.

Clearance was - load new route to LEV. Rest of route unchanged. Free text stated GLADZ.LEV.../IAH. I did not notice the route portion of the message because it was so short, and thought the clearance was only to proceed direct to ZZZ. First Officer (FO) did not notice the error either and programmed the FMC for direct LEV with abeams as I directed, without GLADZ. ATC noticed we had turned to LEV and not GLADZ, and asked if we were proceeding direct to LEV. He stated that he must not have sent the message correctly and then verbally cleared us Direct to LEV. I believe he was trying to be kind and let us off the hook. In seeing the CPDLC message 'load new route to LEV' I simply assumed it was to go just direct LEV and failed to read all of the message and use the LOAD prompt to load the FMC from the CPDLC clearance. I wanted to manually program the FMC with the Direct in order to utilize the abeam waypoints function. Expectation Bias.In the future I will be certain to read ALL of the incoming CPDLC message, ask for confirmation from other pilot and to use the Load new ROUTE function and then reverify the clearance from the CPDLC against the FMC before executing the new route in the FMC, using the pilot monitoring (PM) to verify the new clearance loaded correct.				An air carrier pilot reported they received a reroute via CPDLC. They failed to read the whole message and loaded the route incorrectly causing them to deviate off course.

As we crossed over the Chesapeake Bay Area just north of Norfolk VOR, I noticed that there was a contrail directly in front of our aircraft that we were flying directly within. I assumed that perhaps we were in the wake turbulence of another aircraft and requested a right deviation of up to 3 miles right of course to see if we could get out of the wake turbulence that we appeared to be flying into. Washington ATC questioned why I wanted the right deviation and I advised them that there was a cloud we were attempting to avoid. The right deviation was approved and I was told to proceed to ZJAAY after deviation and I selected a 20 to 25 degree heading to the right of course to exit the bumpy air. After approximately 2 minutes of the heading we had exited the choppy air and I selected a heading back to the left to start heading back over towards our original course line and then proceeded to input into the FMS the Direct to JZAAY point as directed by ATC. The airplane after I selected LNAV began a right turn to proceed directly to JZAAY and then the controller asked us in a frantic voice, 'where are you going'. I advised him that we were direct to ZJAYY and he replied 'NO YOURE NOT'. I advised him that we were in the turn directly to ZJAAY and then he advised a [other carrier] flight to descend to FL360 and then advised me that I had a possible pilot deviation and standby to copy a number. I then received the number and asked ATC to pull the tapes. I noticed that there was an aircraft approximately 5 miles away from me heading southbound at FL 370 wrong direction but verified that I never deviated left of my original course line on the airway. We never even came close to the other aircraft according to our TCAS system and never received a traffic call or a TA or RA call from the TCAS system.Cause: Looking back at this I might have put in an aggressive turn back towards the original course while I input data into the FMS but I am pretty certain that we never deviated left of our original course and by the time the ATC controller asked me where I was going I was already heading directly to ZJAAY as directed.Suggestions: Perhaps always putting the direct to point in the FMS and selecting that instead of using heading select may have not appeared to be such a large turn back towards the original course.				B737-800 Captain reported a track deviation occurred following a wake vortex encounter in cruise flight.

At the same time, we quickly saw multiple amber Xs and screens flicker, but was too quick to see which ones. Shortly after we saw it again and it was clear that multiple relays seem to be malfunctioning, but more this time. I was able to see over the next couple occurrences that the TAT (Total Air Temperature) and SAT (Static Air Temperature) indicators, CA (Captain) outlet, FMGS1, ND1 (Navigation Display 1), VHF1 on FO (First Officer) side also went out temporarily. I called back to ask the FAs (Flight Attendants) if they noticed anything, and they hadn't yet, but on the third occurrence, they reported the WIFI and the lights were flickering. About the 3rd or 4th occurrence (they happened quickly in a fairly short span of time) that my FMGS1 was now out as well as the Fuel Used numbers were reset and Fuel used for engine 2 indicators also ambered out. At this point I had asked the lead FA to do a sweep of the cabin to see if they see or smell smoke or hear anything suspicious. I had remembered that a pattern of electrical anomalies can be a possible sign of electrical fire, so I had begun to plan for that. Shortly after the lead FA said that there was a strange buzzing sound over row XX (where the Wi-Fi is) and a strange smell of possible smoke. At this point while still on the line with the FA, I gave him a briefing, and as I had seen ZZZ as the closest airport, fortunately with maintenance as well, telling him that is where we are going, [advising ATC] (while coordinating with the FO who was the flying pilot). At this point, I had decided to prepare for a possible electrical fire, and we rapidly descended from our cruise altitude of FL370. We were about 10 min away and did our duties preparing for the landing, calling the fire trucks as a precautionary method. As electrical fire is a dire situation, I was not going to hesitate, as dispatch and Maintenance Control was not fully aware of what was going on, although I did briefly send a few ACARS messages explaining it. They had suggested ZZZ1, but it was about 30 min away. I called for ZZZ while dispatch/Maintenance Control coordinated well to prepare for the landing in ZZZ. We landed safely with a full stop on the runway, completing all SOPs. Fire trucks pulled the infrared sensors and noted no heat anomalies, and we were cleared to the gate. On arrival Maintenance Control stated they received a message from our aircraft that the ENG1 IDG (Integrated Drive Generator) had failed. We had not seen that message, and while it may have popped up briefly, I did hit the recall button multiple times showing normal during the events on the flight. We had deplaned immediately on gate arrival; fire fighters did a full infrared/temperature screening twice of the interior and exterior and found no heat anomalies. It was concluded that the ENG1 IDG had or was failing, so we did an engine run to confirm and deactivate the IDG.				Airbus A320 air carrier pilot reported electrical problems while climbing to cruise altitude. The crew coordinated with the cabin crew to troubleshoot the problem, diverted, and landed safely.

The Approach Controller gave us a base turn and asked us to call the field in sight. The Captain called the field in sight and began the base turn and disengaged the autopilot. It was a tight base turn, ultimately inside of ZZZZZ1. Once the PF (Pilot Flying) began the turn, we also began the final configuration changes, switched to Tower, and completed the Before Landing Checklist.During the turn to final, I could tell the we were turning tight based on the navigation display. However, my primary attention was on the configuration, radio calls, and checklist. Sitting on the outside of the turn, I trusted that the PF had the field in sight. I considered that there might be a misidentification, but since we were on the left runway and the turn kept us away from [Runway] XXR, I dismissed the idea. After all the tasks were complete, we were left of centerline with a correction. The PF admitted to 'biting off' on the wrong set of lights. I suggested turning more right, which the PF did, around 1000 ft. Before 500 ft., Tower issued a Low Altitude Alert. In retrospect, this should have triggered a go-around, especially on a visual at night. At the time, I estimated that the PF's correction was sufficient and that we would make the 500 ft. gate. Visually, we also seemed to be close to glide path, so I thought the altitude alert might have been based more on our lateral path than our vertical path. Identification of the vertical path was complicated during the correction to centerline by conflicting information. The PAPI showed us below path while the ILS showed us above. I was aware that both may be limited to a particular envelope left/right of course and might not be correct until closer to centerline. I made a comment to the PF about not trusting the PAPI yet. However, the visual glidepath indications were probably the more accurate. By 500 ft., we were essentially wings level and on profile and continued the approach.We were also low on fuel. Our planned landing fuel was 4.7 based on the load of 8.2 in ZZZ1. On the arrival, the last number I remember on the Prog page was 4.3. This meant that a go-around would immediately put us into a minimum fuel situation. I didn't have time to do all the math at the time, but I was concerned at the time about running out of options. However, assuming 1.5 for a missed approach and landing, we could have landed with about 3.5 and stayed above the FAR Reserve listed on the Release. I don't have minimal experience managing low fuel states and we probably would have been okay with 3.5, considering the clear weather and nearby airports. Planning a landing fuel that doesn't allow for a go-around without the Fuel Low lights illuminating is a poor plan. However, I hinted and hoped at the situation in ZZZ1 rather than asking directly for more gas.I should have called a go-around for an unstable approach below 1000 ft. due to both the lateral and vertical deviations. Deviations in the lateral path made deviations in the vertical path hard to measure. In the future, if I can't positively determine that we're stable, then we are unstable. A slightly longer final would provide a little more time to deal with the turn before managing the descent and allow a lower rate of descent from the radar altitude to catch the glidepath. It also allows more time to correct the lateral path before reaching 1000 ft. in the event an error occurs. Also, I will insist on enough fuel to do a go-around and land by 4.0 in order to remove the perceived fuel pressure.				Air carrier B737 First Officer reported an unstable approach during a night visual approach after the Captain overshot the turn to final. The First Officer had concerns about fuel remaining and after correcting for the ATC issued low altitude alert, the crew landed.

As I got strapped in and began assessing the situation the oil temperature proceeded to turn red and was pinned in the red for over 30 seconds while the Captain already had the high oil temperature QRH procedure out which stated if red proceed to shutdown engine 1 checklist.  We noticed the oil quantity dipped as low as 3 qts while descending/diverting and after about 1 minute in the red the oil temperature number indication went blank.  We proceeded with the engine shutdown checklist.  Notified ATC, Dispatch the Flight Attendants for a precautionary landing and eventually the passengers.  We followed all non normal and normal checklist then we landed in ZZZ followed by Airport Firefighting parked all of which was uneventful and smooth.  We made the log entry talked with our Chief Pilots, Dispatch and Mechanics while making a log entry of the event. The main factor was the high oil temperature then low oil quantity.  Outside of that the rest of the diversion went smoothly.  I believe we operated professionally, followed SOPs and made a safe diversion and landing.  We believe this was purely mechanical and the high oil temperature was out of our control.				737-800 First Officer reported rising oil temperature on the #1 engine, resulting in an engine shutdown and a single-engine diversion.

As the aircraft descended, both bleed lights came on. The FO (First Officer) the QRH procedure and each item was completed. Both crew members noticed the duct pressure at zero, so as the pilot flying I extended the speed brake to bring the power up.  This did not work as the duct pressure remained at zero. At about 22,000 feet the cabin altitude horn came on. We advised ATC and were cleared down to 10,000 feet. At 10,000 feet I called the flight attendants to see if the masks had fallen, but they had not. While speaking with the flight attendants, it became apparent that only the pilots knew what had happened. We landed at ZZZ on runway XX without further incident.We should have advised tower at ZZZ, since they tried to slow us down and treat us as a normal flight.There was a recent write-up in the book with the same problem. Maybe more information could have been provided so maintenance could have found the problem.		We were at FL310 on the ZZZZZ arrival, just outside of ZZZZZ1, and cleared to descend via the arrival into ZZZ. The aircraft's VNAV began its descent at ZZZZZ1. When the thrust came to idle both BLEED lights illuminated with a master caution. The captain was the PF (Pilot Flying) and I was the PM. The captain called for the QRH and I completed the checklist and consulted with the captain to ensure it was done properly. We then noticed the duct pressure had also gone to 0. The CA (Captain) pulled the speed brakes to get the thrust to come up to see if we would get any pressure which we did not. As we continued in the descent, we were at about FL220-FL200 and the cabin altitude horn came on. I checked the cabin alt and noted it was about 10,000 feet. At this point, we asked for an immediate descent to 10,000 feet. ATC inquired if was for a pressurization issue which I said yes and we advised ATC. We were cleared down to 8,000 ft and direct ZZZZZ2. We continued to ZZZ with no other noted issues.While ATC did a great job giving us priority and direct to the field, ZZZ tower was still taking off planes fairly close to us. They even pulled a CRJ on the runway with us at about the bridge and eventually got them to exit the runway when they realized we were a little too close.This was an issue that was written up a few days prior and is a reoccurring event.		B737-800 flight crew reported a loss of cabin pressure during descent when thrust was reduced to idle. Flight crew continued descent and landed at destination airport.

We asked to taxi somewhere to run some checklists. The ECAM called to shutdown Engine 2 which we followed. After all checklists were complete we started to taxi to the gate. Shortly after I started to taxi I lost steering and all screens went black. I stopped the aircraft on the taxiway. It appeared we lost generator 1. Our APU was on MEL, Engine 2 was now inop and was left with battery power. I could hear engine 1 running but it seemed to be higher than idle based on sound but nothing could be confirmed with no engine indications. I decided to shut down engine 1 as a precautionary shutdown not knowing its current conditions or any parameters on the engine. We contacted ATC and advised we will need to be towed in. We contacted Ops to coordinate the tow in. We arrived just short of the gate with battery power when I turned the batteries off as they died. APU, engine 2 reverser, gen 1 fault had previous write ups. Maintenance write ups were done.				A320 pilot reported receiving fault messages for both thrust reversers after deployment on landing.

I immediately shut off PACK 2 and we initiated the Procedure for removal of odor/fumes. The Lead Flight Attendant reported that she had experienced symptoms as early as 30 minutes prior to landing. As this was during descent and arrival, there were multiple power changes throughout the time period. After blocking in at the gate, I shut down engines and kept all bleeds and PACKS turned off. We notified Maintenance Control, completed the safety form, notified the Chief Pilot, and assisted the cabin crew in obtaining medical assistance. I worked with the Maintenance crew to explain what had happened.  After several cycles of the APU Bleed, I got back onboard to help Maintenance identify whether the odor was cleared out. It was not and I helped them identify the specific smell that indicates a TCP (tricresyl phosphate) generated fume event.

Event was very similar to an unusual attitude event in the simulator. My FO (First Officer) handled it perfectly as he clicked off autopilot before it disconnected. He rolled wings level and raised the nose before we got an over speed. He even included, 'My aircraft,' which was perfect. We were in the clear above clouds, with no convective activity around so I asked ATC what we were following. The controller said there was a 737 about 10 miles ahead at FL 340. The wind was on our nose at 82 kts, so it seemed consistent with a wake turbulence encounter. I checked with the Flight Attendants who reported everybody was fine. I then made a PA to explain the wake turbulence encounter. The aircraft was flying fine so we continued to ZZZ and made a normal approach and landing. I made a logbook entry of the momentary severe turbulence encounter due to wake turbulence.Despite being 10 miles behind another 737, the winds on the nose of 82 kts set us up for the worst wake turbulence encounter of my years on the 737! This was totally unexpected and strange!		The Captain and myself experienced wake turbulence from a B737 10 miles away. The wake put us in an undesirable aircraft state, about 60 degrees bank to the left with a nose down attitude. No one was injured.Cause was wake turbulence.		Air Carrier B737-800 flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence 10 miles in trail of another B737 at FL340 resulting in an inflight upset.

We recognized the pressurization issue due to our ears popping and feeling pressure. We looked at the pressurization screen and seen the cabin altitude at negative 4,400 ft. and the VSI moving erratically up a down reaching negative 3,900 ft. at one point. This was followed by a master caution CAM CAB PR SYS 2 FAULT. The outflow valve showed completely closed, and the safety valve showed completely open. We followed the ECAM to manually operate the outflow valve by using the manual vertical speed. This however, did not work. We did an urgent decent from 24,000 feet to 8,000 ft. and [requested priority handling] straight to ZZZ. We continued to troubleshoot the problem with no success. Upon landing on Runway XXR in ZZZ, making a turn off, our ears were still popping and feeling pressure. The cabin altitude still showed negative 4,400 ft. and a differential pressure psi of 2.5. After turning both packs off this still did not fix the problem. I asked the First Officer (FO) if he could open his cockpit window to depressurize the aircraft. The First Officer was unable to open his window. I was finally able to open my window and depressurize the airplane. We continued to taxi to the gate. No injuries reported just inner ear discomfort from Crew and Passengers. We filled out the logbook and gave a full brief of our issue to maintenance and left the aircraft.				A320 Captain reported pressurization problems and being unable to rectify the issue with manual mode as per ECAM.  After landing crew was unable to depressurize the aircraft on the ground until a cockpit window was opened after air conditioning packs were selected to off.

Engines stable. I then advanced the thrust levers. Engines started accelerating properly. CL (Climb Detent) and later Engine 1 advanced normally. Engine 2 EPR hung about 2/3 low. Aircraft yawed, EPR 2 not advancing. I believe I was out of the keep out zone. I rejected the takeoff at 40/50 knots. I briefly considered Max thrust. However with #2 not accelerating at all I was concerned about #1 continuing to advance to Max and #2 not accelerating. We did get a quick ding and ECAM flash. It might have been 'ENG THR levers not set'. Regardless, it was unsafe to continue and advance to MAX and the RTO (Rejected Take Off) was underway. After review, maintenance presented a company bulletin. We decided it would be safe to attempt another takeoff but in MAX. On next take off, #2 did not advance as quickly. But it was smooth, stabilized at Max and I decided to continue. In hindsight, even though I feel it was a safe maneuver, I wish I would have accomplished another RTO. Of course I have more information now. The jet was grounded in ZZZ1 and after an engine run it looks like the P2T2 probe was an issue.				A320 flight crew reported engine acceleration anomaly during takeoff roll resulting in a rejected takeoff.

We elected not to raise the gear as the aircraft was performing well and didn't want to make the situation worse by bringing loose tread into the wheel well. At about 800 ft the FA's called the flightdeck and I answered briefly to say that we blew a tire/everything was going to be ok and that we'd call them back. The F/O (First Officer) notified the Tower that we had indications of a blown tire on takeoff and requested a straight out departure.  Initially, I called for flaps up after accelerating at about 1500 ft AGL. Once the flaps were up the takeoff configuration horn alerted so we brought the flaps back to 1. During initial radar vectors, we advised ATC and stated that we'd need to return to ZZZ but needed time to coordinate and run checklists. The only other indication that we had of gear problems was the ANTI SKID INOP light was illuminated. I handed the control of the aircraft and the radios to the F/O so that I could make a PA to the Passengers, coordinate with ops, the FA's and reference the AOM/QRH. I made a quick PA and called the FAs, which was when I was told that a ceiling panel had come loose and injured 2 of our Passengers but that they were stable. We let ATC know we had injuries and provided the info that we had. At this point I referenced the AOM for landing gear tire failure on takeoff. I read the high points of that section to the F/O, so that we were on the same page, while waiting for ops to set up a patch with Dispatch. I was also busy coordinating with our F/As, Jumpseater (Company Captain) on how best to stow the loose ceiling panel such that I wouldn't impede egress. Subsequent to that, the Master Caution illuminated for the #1 ENG HYD LOW PRESS.  The F/O pointed out that the pressure was good but that the QTY was low and decreasing. Initially we elected to run the LOSS of SYSTEM A Checklist, figuring it was only a matter of time but decided to back out of that checklist since we still had good steady pressure even after the quantity read 0. We ran the #1 ENG HYD LOW PRESS checklist which directed us to turn off the pump. Once that was complete, we ran the Descent and Approach Checklists and asked for vectors to final. On about an eight-mile final, the Master Caution illuminated again, and we realized we were losing System A. We went around and asked for delay vectors again, while we ran the LOSS of SYSTEM A Checklist. Once that was complete, including performance data, we were vectored for landing. The landing was normal other than only getting one reverser and the shimmy from the blown tire. Directional control seemed normal, and braking was good, albeit slightly less than normal, which I expected. I had the F/O keep an eye on the accumulator pressure just in case. I also directed the F/O to start the APU. After slowing to about 30 knots and testing the tiller we told Tower we would exit the runway. I let the aircraft coast down the runway to exit. Upon slowing through approximately 20 knots, the aircraft started veering left and I couldn't maintain directional control. I stopped the aircraft as best I could with the nose ultimately 90 degrees to the left of centerline, but on the paved surface. B System Hydraulics registered 0 quantity. I then made a PA to the PAX to remain seated. Once the APU was on the busses, I shut down the engines and we started communications with CFR. They said there were no indications of fire, so we elected to keep the Passengers onboard the aircraft. The main thing we should have done differently is to have stopped straight ahead on the runway as expeditiously as we could have. I'm guessing the extra seconds we spent coasting down the runway was the time it took for the B System to lose quantity and pressure as well as the right brake to fail.		During rotation, left main tire blowout, causing partial loss of hydraulics.During rotation we felt what we believed was nose-wheel shimmy. The shimmy and vibration got quickly worse after liftoff, and we realized we had a blown tire. The Captain stated we had a blown tire and to leave the landing gear extended. We notified ATC that we possibly had a blown tire and would return to ZZZ. We retracted the flaps and got the takeoff config warning horn, so we extended the flaps to 1 to prevent the takeoff config warning horn from sounding, and we maintained about 190 knots. ATC climbed us to 6000 ft. We started to get vectored back to ZZZ. The Captain gave me the aircraft and radios, while he coordinated with the Flight Attendants and Dispatch. The FAs reported some Passengers had been injured by an overhead panel that had fallen down from the vibration. I ran the numbers and setup the FMC and radios for our return to ZZZ. The landing data stated would be landing about 14,000 pounds overweight, but due to the injured passengers we opted to land ASAP in the interest of passenger safety. We reviewed the AOM "tire failure on takeoff" items. During our delay vectors we got a 'hydraulic system A engine low pressure' caution light. We noticed that the system A quantity was about 30 and decreasing rapidly, we began to run the 'loss of system A' QRH, but decided since we still had hydraulic A pressure, we should just run the 'low pressure engine A' QRH.  We turned off the Engine A hydraulic switch per QRH.I made a PA announcement to the passengers explaining we were doing a precautionary landing due to what we believed was a blown tire. We told ATC we were ready to land. On final at approximately 2000 ft we received 'low pressure electric A' light.  We told ATC we needed to go around and run some checklists as we had just lost one of our hydraulic systems. We ran the performance data for "loss of system A" and ran the QRH for "loss of system A". We vectored around again. We turned on the "system A flight control standby rudder" and "alternate nose wheel steering". Upon landing, we maintained centerline and appeared to have directional control. There were heavy vibrations during the entire landing. Landing was normal until approximately 20 knots going straight down the runway, the aircraft started to turn to the left, the Captain stated the brakes and nose wheel steering were becoming ineffective, and the aircraft slowly came to a stop facing 90 degrees left, still on the runway pavement.  The Captain called the FAs and made a PA to remain seated. We started the APU and shut the engines down. We stowed the speedbrakes and extended the flaps to 40 to be ready for an evacuation if we needed to do so. Fire trucks approached the aircraft, they reported some smoke from the right main tires, and one of our right main tires was blown. They said they didn't see any need for an evacuation. Fire Department said the brake temps were approximately 390 degrees, and they would chock the tires. Fire dept chocked the tires and asked us to release the brakes. Approximately 15 minutes after stopping, airstairs were brought to the aircraft, and the EMTs came onboard through the forward entry door to evaluate the injured Passengers. After maybe another 15 minutes, three buses arrived, and we deplaned everyone into the buses.		B737 flight crew reported a blown tire on takeoff as well as a hydraulic systems failure that required a return to the departure airport.

PF asked Pilot Monitoring (PM) to attempt nose down electric trim as well to no avail. Both CA and First Officer (FO) controls had no nose down trim capability but electric trim and auto trim did work for nose up inputs. The CA (PF) directed the PM to request a vector from ATC and to maintain 8000 ft. and 250KIAS to establish a controllable flaps up/gear up flight regime. During the climb and level off, it was also determined that the auto-throttles did not respond appropriately to FMC or Mode Control Panel (MCP) speed window inputs. The last correct input from the auto-throttles was upon depressing the TOGA buttons for takeoff where it was apparent that the throttles were essentially in a 'hold' mode. As a result, airspeed reached between 250-260KIAS during the climb prior to recognizing the auto-throttles were also inoperative.Because of workload concerns, initially the CA opted to [request priority handling] while determining the available control ability and choosing the appropriate checklist. Once leveled off and manually trimmed to a straight and level attitude, the flight controls and radios were transferred to the FO as planned during the Pre-Departure briefing. The CA then took the role of PM and handled the stabilizer trim inoperative, overweight landing, and non-routine landing checklists while communicating with Dispatch, Flight Attendants, and Passengers. A flaps 15, overweight (154k GW) landing was executed.  We rolled to the end of the runway uneventfully where ZZZ fire and rescue met the aircraft for a hot brakes inspection. With company maintenance concurrence, we decided that there was no concern taxiing under our own power to parking. Brake temperatures were monitored by safety crew and where they continued to follow us to the gate. Recent 737 MAX training with emphasis on trim runaway situations played a substantial role in the safe and expeditious recognition of the aircraft malfunction.  As a result, both CA and FO were very well prepared to execute the appropriate checklists without further incident.				B737 pilot reported stabilizer trim and autothrottle malfunctions.

When the ATC explained that we were following Aircraft Y 8 NM ahead, we volunteered to slow further as well as our willingness to accept a delay vector. We were told that slowing further was not possible as there was an aircraft behind us as well on the arrival and that a turn wouldn't be necessary. Shortly thereafter, less than 5 minutes, we encountered wake turbulence presumably from Aircraft Y in front of us. We maintained control of the aircraft but definitely encountered both roll and pitch consistent with wake/moderate turbulence. We informed the controller and were given vectors immediately.

I don't remember actually saying that we are [requesting priority handling] but I did tell ATC souls on board as well as fuel and the issue. I did check in with the next Controller saying 'Company XXX [Priority] Aircraft.' Once we got closer to ZZZ, the quantity started to dwindle and we eventually ran the Low Pressure QRH, which led to a shutdown of the #2 Engine. Shut down the engine around 12,000 ft. and landed uneventfully.				B737-700 pilot reported a decreasing oil quantity indication while in cruise flight. Crew elected to divert and eventually shut the engine down as the quantity continued to decrease.

The air flow was accompanied by a loud rush of air and debris flying about the cockpit. We immediately stopped the climb and requested a descent to 10,000 feet. The cabin vertical speed was fluctuating with the pulsing of the airflow the hot air valve was noted in the closed position as per MEL. A call to the cabin confirmed the same conditions occurring in the cabin. The Flight Attendants were advised of our return to ZZZ for a normal landing. With several symptoms of a depressurization event we quickly got clearance to return to ZZZ for an uneventful landing and return to the gate. All normal checklists were completed. Landing data was received. The overweight landing checklist was referenced and complied with. Dispatch was advised via ACARS				Air carrier flight crew reported the loss of aircraft pressurization during climb. The QRH procedures were completed and received clearance to departure airport where a safe overweight landing was completed.

The FO asked how ATC had that information in the absence of a PIREP. ATC explained that they used technology. We departed XXL with an assigned heading of 150 and a clearance to climb to 3000 ft. On a right downwind, were switched to departure. At that moment, just south of ZZZ1, the right engine experienced severe vibration accompanied with abnormal N1 and EGT indications. The EGT indicated an exceedance and displayed a red 'disk'. ATC cleared us to 6000 ft, but I set the altitude in the MCP (Mode Control Panel) to 3000 ft and advised Captain to maintain heading. It took several seconds to transmit to ATC, due to multiple aircraft in the approach/departure corridor. I advised ATC and requested immediate return to ZZZ. ATC asked if we were ready to return right away, and I informed them that we needed vectors to a safe area to allow us to run a checklist, then we would advise them. I started the Engine Vibration Checklist, then stopped. I reminded Captain that we had an exceedance, and the correct checklist was the Engine Fire, Failure, Severe Damage, or Separation QRC, followed by the QRH. We followed both the QRC and QRH deliberately and methodically, and once we were on the Deferred Items of the Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist, I requested vectors to the ILS XY Approach, and briefed the visual approach backed up by the ILS. We were landing Flaps 15, using speed off the INIT REF page, after verifying that we were not overweight. ATC advised us of LLWS on final approach. I referred to PROG PAGE 2 to ensure that we were not landing with a tailwind component. It was difficult to slow the aircraft down to VREF at Flaps 15, so I extended the speedbrake 30% to create drag. (The limitation for use of speedbrakes are up to Flaps 10). I explained to Captain that I had to 'hang some tin' to get the speed under control, and we did not want excess kinetic energy. We landed with Autobrakes 3, taxied off at taxiway 1, and were instructed to wait at the holding pad. The ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) inspected the exterior of the aircraft, especially the right engine, then took the brake temperature (700C). After 30 minutes, we were cleared to be towed to the ramp. The Flight Attendants performed an excellent job of controlling the Passengers and keeping them calm. There were only XX people onboard, but not everyone spoke English, so that was a challenge. I kept the Passengers and Crew informed during the whole adventure, explaining that we would return to ZZZ and exchange this aircraft for a 'newer one'. I did this in English and in Spanish. My F/O performed his PF tasks flawlessly, displaying superb airmanship and reflecting the quality of his training. The Flight Attendants are to be commended on their professionalism and actions, which kept all of our customers safe from the moment of the fire to the deplaning at the gate.Good preparation and constant drills in the simulator, along with standardized briefings and adherence to SOPs made this event resemble a training exercise rather than a full-blown emergency. Every Crew Member did their jobs flawlessly. My only exception was the deliberate use of speedbrakes at Flaps 15, when the SOP prohibits their use above flaps 10. I chose this course of action because the risk of damaging the flap/speedbrakes was outweighed by the risk of a high-energy touchdown and a possible overrun, or the risk of a single-engine go-around in conditions of low-level windshear.				B737 Captain reported an engine vibration and EGT exceedance during climb. The crew returned to the departure airport and landed safely.

We were cleared for departure on Runway XXL and given a right turn and climb to 5000 ft. The takeoff was a normal event and once we rolled out to our assigned heading around 1800 ft, we had a bang and the aircraft rolled to the right. I quickly gained corrective control of the aircraft and the Captain (PM) announced the engine failure. He [requested priority] and stopped the climb at 2000 ft. Once we established the aircraft heading and received vectors from ATC, we began the QRH and QRC for engine failure, fire, and separation. The Captain was in communication with the Cabin Crew and ATC during the event. Once the engine was shut down and secure we prepared for the visual approach back into XX. Airport fire was standing by and we taxied to the hot break section of the airport for a visual inspection of the brakes by the Fire Crews. Once we got the go-ahead from the Fire Department we communicated with Ground Ops and ATC to be towed back to the departure gate.				B737-700 First Officer reported an engine failure during climb. The flight crew completed the QRH procedure and was provided priority handling to the departure airport where a safe landing was completed.

After takeoff, at approximately 300 ft. to 400 ft., I noticed the #1 Engine EGT went red and indicated 968 degrees. I incorrectly stated we had an engine overheat because I saw the high EGT. At 1000 ft. after cleaning up the aircraft, I asked the F/O (First Officer) to pull out the QRH for Engine Overheat and as he looked at the index, he realized that it was a QRC item (as was the checklist we should have run: Engine Limit or Surge or Stall). We ran the Engine Overheat QRC and QRH. Everything with the wrong QRC/QRH went as I was expecting with the one exception of it having us retard the thrust lever all the way to idle rather than to the point where the indication went away as I was expecting; however, I clarified with the F/O that that was what it said, and we again failed to trap the error. The red indication went away shortly after reducing the thrust lever. We informed Tower we would be returning to ZZZ, due to a malfunction with our #1 engine. I notified the flight attendants of the situation and that we did not anticipate an evacuation. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them know of the situation and that we were returning to ZZZ. I also requested that they get us a gate. We had requested with ATC slightly extended vectors to Runway XX, in order to accomplish all the Non-normal and Normal Checklists and to set up and brief the approach and landing. We [requested priority handling] with ATC, so that the Crash Fire Rescue would be on hand, in case we had any further engine trouble and due to the fact that we would be landing overweight in a high ambient temperature of 99 degrees F. We decided to perform a 15 Flap landing in case we had to go around and had any further trouble with the #1 Engine, especially due to the high ambient temperature with a fully loaded aircraft. We also elected to use autobrakes 3. The landing was smooth, and we rolled out to Taxiway 1 at Tower's request, so that we could pull off into the de-ice pad for the fire trucks to inspect the aircraft. We ran the brake cooling performance data. We had to allow 30 minutes of cooling before returning to the gate. We coordinated with Crash Fire Rescue to shut down the engines so that they could chock the nose wheel for us to release the parking brake and help with brake cooling. At this point, we debriefed how we handled anything and as we reviewed the QRH again on the ground the F/O noticed that the indications section of the QRH showed the Engine Overheat lights and that that did not match our situation. This is when we realized we should have run the Engine Limit or Surge or Stall QRC and QRH. After the 30 minutes brake cooling, we coordinated to have the chocks removed and restarted the #2 Engine. Crash Fire Rescue followed us taxiing. We ensured Ground Personnel would be aware that #2 Engine would be running instead of the usual #1 Engine until we were stopped at the gate.After selecting the wrong QRC and continuing into the QRH, we should have re-verified the indications shown above the QRH steps. This would have shown us that we were in the wrong checklist. Additionally, I should have queried more than I did when I felt that retarding the thrust lever to idle rather than just until the indication went away. I should have had us re-verify the indications/condition section of the QRH. Lastly, I think consideration should be given to removing these two emergency checklists from the QRC and to only have them in the QRH. This would drive the first actions we take to be verifying the indications prior to following an initial wrong selection that gets us headed down the wrong path. Alternatively, I think adding the indications to the QRC, would help limit this kind of error.				Air carrier Captain reported on departure one of the engines indicated a high Exhaust Gas Temperature. The flight crew retarded power to idle on the engine and returned to the airport for an overweight landing.

Approximately 30 minutes after departure and level at FL300 just northwest of the SULOM fix and roughly 250 miles from the VIDP airport, we received a GPWS "TERRAIN TERRAIN" warning (both aural and visual). We executed the GPWS Actions and Callouts per the B777 AOM. The warning continued up to the aircraft's Max Altitude of FL325. At that point, we confirmed both on our own and with ATC that we were on course and above all terrain. The GPWS warning continued to display and sound until we manually switched it off. After cycling the TERRAIN OVRD switch, the system appeared to reset itself and operated normally. It should be noted that the GPWS warning was proceeded by a GPS jamming display received earlier in the flight; GPS Jamming warning. With GPS jamming occurring on a regular frequency on flights in the Middle East, I believe that a thorough review of jamming affects on the different aircraft systems during recurrent ground school training would be very advantageous to those who fly these routes.				Air carrier B777 Captain reported GPS jamming in-flight. Although well above any terrain, the pilot received a terrain warning and earlier, a GPS jamming message.

Incidentally, the exact same thing happened the prior day when we had to do go-around on Runway 17L at DFW, same scenario. I spoke to DFW Tower and Approach supervisors.Since east side DFW down to 2 runways, the controllers are getting spacing wrong. Also, I don't think many controllers realize the B737 approach speeds are about 7 to 10 kts higher than most other transport category aircraft.Suggestion: Make controllers aware of higher 737 approach speeds and increase spacing!

We then discussed the landing implications without the green system. A phone patch with Dispatch and Maintenance confirmed the best decision was to land at ZZZ1 due to the longer runway. With no green system, we had to manually lower the gear, would not have left thrust reverser, no nose wheel steering and be on alternate braking. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and coordinated that we would be stopping on the runway. After gravity extending the gear, the approach and landing were uneventful on XXR in ZZZ1.

I instructed the FO (First Officer) to place the bleeds in the Hot Weather configuration, with the APU on. As he was moving the ENG 1 Bleed air switch off the ENG 1 Overheat light illuminated and then went off. We put the bleed back on and tried to get a recall but nothing came up. All engine instrumentation read out normal, so we thought it was a fluke. Everything was normal on taxi out and take off. With the engines at climb power and climbing through roughly 5000 ft, the ENG 1 overheat light illuminated along with a master caution. My FO continued flying, I ran the QRC. We leveled off at 8000 ft, [requested priority handling] and got vectors back to ZZZ. The QRC had me turn the A/T (autothrottles) off and retard the number 1 Eng to idle. After a few seconds the overheat light extinguished. All engine instruments were indicating normal. I continued to the QRH, once finished we returned to ZZZ and landed with ENG 1 at idle. Fire and Rescue met us on the runway and gave us the all clear. We then taxied back to the gate. Cause: Possibly a fault somewhere in the overheat detection system, exasperated by the extreme heat. Suggestion: The only change I would have made was to call Maintenance after the initial occurrence, though I am not sure they would have been able to do anything or get the aircraft to recreate the fault.				Air carrier Captain reported engine #1 overheat light illuminated during climb.

The subsequent fault was written up and it was noted that in the MEL cross reference list stated "No Dispatch".  Maintenance came out and was instructed by Maintenance Control to perform a reset and then run the engines.  The engines were both run for 2 minutes with no faults and the discrepancy was cleared.  The plane was boarded and during our crew brief, the first officer and I collaborated about the fault in the event the fault came back during the takeoff.  Since ZZZ is a short runway, I lined the aircraft up and held the brakes for a static T.O.  FLEX thrust was applied and the T.O. roll began.  The best estimate was that the fault occurred between 80-100 knots.  The same fault came up as in the previous flight except line item 1 was different.  The first officer read off "Engine 1 Thrust Lever Idle", and at that time the Takeoff was Aborted.After we returned to the gate we were able to talk to the FA's (Flight Attendant) and they brought up that after we started moving they noticed a popping sound coming from the left side of the aircraft.  I had the FO (First Officer) go check the #1 engine for any physical damage but he reported that that he did not see any. When serious faults that deal with major components occur, it might be prudent to take a more strict approach than just doing a soft reset and sending the aircraft on its way.				Air carrier Captain reported a safe rejected takeoff executed due to an ECAM ENG 1 Compressor Vane light illuminated during takeoff roll. The Captain stated this anomaly has been a recurring issue.

While cruising at FL320 felt vibrations on yoke. Vibrations became stronger so I checked the Engine page, which showed left engine N1 vibrations to be at 3.2 while the right engine read 1.5. Vibrations increased steadily over the next 5 minutes to 3.8-3.9. At this point Maintenance was contacted and made aware of the readings. I explained that we had no published limits that I was aware of. He confirmed this and mentioned that 4.0 was the maintenance limit and as long as we were below that we were OK to continue. Shortly after ending the phone call, the secondary engine indications appeared showing the left engine N1 vibration as a black number four on a white background. After several seconds the indication returned to normal. This was repeated at least 10 times, but what concerning is that the high engine vibration display stayed on longer each time. Maintenance was contacted a second time and when asked as to their suggestion if the flight should continue or land he left it to our discretion. Since the situation was not improving and our flight was scheduled to be over open water for approximately 8 hours I advised dispatch that I did not feel comfortable with going oceanic with this condition. Dispatch asked if we felt if it was safe to return to ZZZ, which we agreed to. Diversion was flown at a lower altitude in order to avoid having to jettison fuel. Normal approach and landing at ZZZ.Cause: Secondary engine page being displayed repeatedly indicating a secondary engine parameter is exceeded. Since flight was scheduled to be over open water for 8-9 hours, I deemed it safer to return to ZZZ than risk a possible diversion to ZZZZ or another airport where maintenance would not be easily accessible.Suggestions: Since we have had other aircraft have issues with high engine vibrations which required a shutdown even though there was no guidance on the EICAS, maybe Boeing/GE should be approached so that some guidance can be developed for these situations.		During the logbook briefing from maintenance, the mechanic discussed the engine change they had just completed and mentioned we were likely to see higher than normal vibrations in the left engine because they hadn't had time to balance the engine the way they normally would.  The CA (Captain) questioned him about it and he said it would be fine for the flight.  We made the initial departure and climb without incident. After initially leveling at FL300, the CA requested a reanalysis of step climb performance from dispatch.  The result included a climb to 320 very shortly after.  Immediately after the climb to FL320, the CA noticed a vibration in the airplane and pulled up the ENG (Engine) page to view the vibration level.  The left engine was significantly higher than the right but within a normal range 'below 4.0'. As we watched it, the Left N1 vibration level continued to increase from 3.2 to 3.9. As the indicator max threshold is 4.0, the CA called Maintenance on the SAT and asked if they were monitoring the engine.  There was some discussion about whether a limit existed and maintenance indicated that anything above 4.0 was outside of tolerance.  Shortly after disconnecting from the sat call, the Left N1 vibe level reached 4.0, then the background of the displayed vibration number turned white and the secondary engine indications displayed on the EICAS.  For the next several minutes in steady state cruise flight the vibration level would decrease to the low 3s then return to 4.0 and the background would inverse to white.  With each climb of the vibrations, it would remain in the inverse 4.0 for a longer period.  Considering the state of the engine and the upcoming 8+ hour pacific crossing ahead, we discussed divert options and our level of comfort continuing across the ocean versus diverting to a maintenance facility in the U.S.  We agreed diverting was the most prudent course of action and dispatch asked if we were comfortable returning to ZZZ.  We were about 2+15 into a 13 hour  flight and needed to reduce landing weight to remain within limits.  As we descended and slowed, the engine vibrations improved significantly and we landed back in ZZZ without further incident.Cause: Engine vibration outside of the normal range/full scale deflection.Suggestions: Consider enhancing guidance or procedures for high engine vibrations inflight.		B777 crew reported high engine vibrations during cruise on engine that had just been changed but not 'balanced' which would have been customary with an engine change.  Crew was advised by Maintenance that the vibrations may be higher but were uncomfortable flying plane over water for extended period with limited guidance in their manuals as to flight limits vs. maintenance limits.

Everything was going smoothly until we were in the climb around 14,000' MSL. I was Pilot Flying and the autopilot was off, when we felt a vibration and noticed the #2 (right) engine N1 roll back to idle. The N1 roll back was followed by an amber ENG FAIL indication on the EGT gauge. The Captain and I decided to [request priority handling], run the engine failure QRH procedure and return to ZZZ. We landed back in ZZZ uneventfully. Once we were clear of the runway, we had personnel inspect the engine for damage, which was found to be minimal. We ran brake cooling calculations in the air but ran them on the ground again with updated brake on speed to ensure we were safe to taxi back to the gate. Once brake cooling data told us we could return to gate, we taxied in without issue.				B737 First Officer reported a vibration followed by an engine failure during climb. Crew performed checklist procedures while returning to departure airport for landing.

As we approached waypoint SULOM we noticed the navigation indication on the lower portion of the PFD (Primary Flight Display) was switching from GPS to INERTIAL and back. Also received the EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) message - ADS B OUT R. This was a new area for navigation disruptions. Normally these types of disruptions occur [in another area]. We made contact with OPLR FIR. Half way between waypoints SULOM AND INDEK with the indications mentioned above, experienced a TERRAIN WARNING. The First Officer was the flying pilot and he reacted to the warning. We climbed about 400 ft. and the warning started to subside. Contacted OPLR to check our position. He showed our altitude at just above 30000 ft. well above the terrain. At the time of the terrain warning, I am fairly certain that there was not a position/map shift.As mentioned above, the OPLR FIR in my experience is not an area of GPS spoofing and navigation disruptions. I flew the same route the next week and did not experience any problems, GPS, ABS B, or TERR. In the areas of extreme GPS spoofing, where we experience loss of both GPS and even look ahead TERR, I have never received and TERR WARNING. I believe my first officer was correct in reacting to the TERR WARNING given the position we were in, approaching some of the highest terrain in the world. We did contact dispatch with all of the details. Maintenance also pinged the aircraft and found no major faults. This event is just part of the challenges of the ZZZ to ZZZZ route. I see no internal or external causal factors.				Air carrier pilot reported a false terrain alert and ADS-B failing EICAS message while flying at 30,000 feet near SULOM intersection. The reporter stated they were not sure if this was the result of GPS jamming since this area is reportedly not known for that.

As I began climbing out, I noticed the aircraft required forward pressure on the side stick. Once I leveled off, and was level on the flight directors, the aircraft still required forward pressure to maintain level flight. The aircraft would constantly pitch up. We were given a higher altitude and I climbed to it. All the while having to push slightly forward on the side stick in the climb. I engaged the autopilot and it maintained the climb and then cruise.Once our workload was reduced I contacted dispatch and maintenance on the satellite phone. I told them that when the autopilot was off, the aircraft required forward pressure on the side stick. Both Flight Directors were indicating the same. Also, when the FO flew, he noticed and felt the same problem. Maintenance had me disconnect the autopilot while in level flight and I noticed the airplane again pitch up. We all agreed the safest course of action was a return to ZZZ. Maintenance also noted  that as we burned fuel and the CG changed, the aircraft could be harder to fly manually.We notified ATC that we would be returning to ZZZ. We also [requested priority handling] as we had some sort of issue with pitch trim in manual flight. I used the [priority handling] call button and gave the flight attendants a heads up. I told them to expect a normal approach and landing. I let them know they would also see emergency vehicles on our landing roll out.We had a long final for XXL at ZZZ and configured early. As I turned the autopilot off, the aircraft still wanted to pitch up. We landed uneventfully back and ZZZ and taxied to our gate.I entered the issue in the logbook and also spoke with the two mechanics that met our aircraft at the gate.				A320 Captain reported experiencing constant uncommanded pitch up movement while on manual flight during climbout requiring forward pressure.

The Captain was PF (Pilot Flying) and FO (First Officer) was PM (Pilot Monitoring). We were slightly high on base during vectors. PM stated "Captain we will need boards and flaps to get down". PF complied. We intercepted LOC and PM called it out. However, we never captured GS. As RFO I articulated "we are high, no GS" this was echoed by RFO2 stating "you're in ALT". The PM was also aware and told the Captain "if we are not going to be stable at 1k, we will need to go around." PF said "ok" and with AP (Autopilot) already off, decreased pitch slightly as an attempted capture GS. At that point no action was taken for several seconds except that slight descent and we were well above GS unable to make a safe landing (4 white PAPI and well above GS). The PM directed a go around around moments later at 1300ft. TOGA was not pushed and no words were spoken by PF. But the aircraft pitched up as Captain flying said something quietly. At this point the PM noticed the PF seemed to be low SA (Situational Awareness) after making callouts for the Captain that he missed. A moment later the FO stated "I have the aircraft" and started to execute the go around. This was the right call since we had hardly climbed and there were no commands from the Captain. I began filling in additional missed call outs as well as the FO. No thrust set call was made because TOGA had not been pushed. The FO was now doing double duty essentially. I did not see the thrust ref FMA or magenta reference on n1, so I began to fixate on the throttle position and speed. We got slow and I said "we are slow, add power." The FO turned off FDs at some point. A few seconds later RFO 2 said set climb attitude since the aircraft was now at 5NL. Next, we worked as a team to confirm heading and ALT by ATC. I noticed we were off and told FO " 20 right for heading." He has his hands full from the non standard go around, but immediately corrected the heading deviation. The Captain wanted to fly but we agreed the FO keep the aircraft and make the landing. At some point TOGA was pushed. The Captain believes he hit it at some point he admitted in debrief. I don't know when, but I believe this is what caused the 5NL attitude because of when we expected the go around and what we had set in the MCP. That is why I believe the FO had to turn off the FDs.Cause: Breakdown in crew communication (captain to FO).Solution: Brief go around procedures.		Captain and FO (First Officer) had the last rest. The other RFO and I swapped out with the flying crew to go change in the supernumerary at approximately top of descent, after having briefed the change over. We had loaded the ZZZZZ arrival and ILS YYR. The other RFO and I returned to the flying crew half way down the arrival. The FO mentioned a runway change back to XXL. On vectors to final and descending through approximate 8-10000, the FO verbalized to the CA (Captain) that we were high and suggest speed brakes to help descend. The CA was noticeably flustered, nervous, and seemed to shake slightly. We were at about 4,000 ft. on a base leg for about a 7-8 NM final. The CA disconnected the AP (Autopilot) and continued a descent to join final and cross the final approach fix a few hundred feet high. The vertical FMA went to ALT and the CA leveled at 1,800 ft. We were at 3 white and a red on the PAPI, but leveling at 1800 ft. resulted in the G/S indicator rapidly indicating we were again high. I announced that "we are in ALT mode and not descending". The CA again initiated a descent. The FO at that time announced "if we are not stable by 1,000 ft., we are going around." At 1,300 ft. and still high/unstable, the FO announced "let's go around." The CA mostly leveled the airplane, but I did not notice the TO/GA button pushed and 10-15 seconds into the GA (Go Around), we were not climbing significantly. The FO was coaching the CA through GA call outs to get the aircraft flight path under control, getting flaps to 20 and calling positive rate. Without significant response by the CA, the FO declared, "I have the airplane" and took the controls. The FO had his hands full with a slow airplane from being level at 1,300 ft. The other RFO called "Push the throttle up!" The CA may have pushed the TOGA button after the FO took the controls, causing more confusion. At the same time I noticed our attitude 5 deg nose low and banked slightly left. I called "Set a climb attitude!" And the FO immediately pitched to resume a climb. The Tower assigned a climb to 4,000 ft. Our heading on departed drifted left 15-20 degree, the other RFO called this out for a correction, and the FO corrected. After stabilizing at 4,000 ft., I called for getting the AP on and in proper FMA's, which the FO did. Approach gave us vectors for the approach. On downwind, the CA said "Okay, I'll take the airplane back." The FO stated "I think I should take this landing." The CA did not argue the point. The FO made an uneventful landing and the CA taxied back to the gate.Cause: The captain had mentioned he had not slept well on the flight and had not eaten much on the flight. It's possible that or some other medical issue could have played a factor in this crew member's breakdown in performance. He didn't seem the same as he was on departure. Solution: Good CRM can bring things back under control when things get undesirable in the flight deck. Sim training for go around at 1,000 ft. would be a huge help to the pilot group. We are most likely to GA at or above 1,000 ft. and those becoming a handful quickly.		Air carrier B777 flight crew reported lack of response from flying pilot on unstable approach resulted in Pilot Monitoring taking control of the aircraft for a go around and subsequent landing.

We had noticed a few other aircraft in front of us at differing altitudes through at least the first half of the flight. While I was upfront for the first half, we had to adjust our SLOP (Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure) a few times to account for the winds and what we can see the other aircraft doing utilizing TCAS and their respective contrails. Prior to the event, we had swapped in the [Relief Pilot] so that the Captain (CA) and I can take our break prior to landing. At the time of the swap, the weather outside was VMC and we were clear of any clouds nearby. We were cruising at FL350, having stepped climbed according to the VNAV CRZ page, at the filed cost index ECON speeds. However, there was a bend in the jet stream right around that time to swap. I had just laid down and strapped myself in when we hit the first bump.I did hear a PA be made within a second of it which I presume is the turbulence PA for the Flight Attendants (FAs). I am not sure which one since it wasn't broadcasted into the bunk room so it was muffled. It was clearly in the moderate category maybe a bit higher at certain points of the event based off of my motion laying down under the seat belt in a dark bunk. The motion of the turbulence did feel like wake turbulence to me and therefore, out of curiosity and since I was on break, I utilized the WIFI to see what was up in front of us. On the app, I saw that there was an aircraft in front of us and only 1,000 feet above our current altitude. I heard the Captain (CA) pick the phone up in the seating area and I told him about what I had found to suggest that we could've possibly had a wake turbulence encounter and to maybe relay to the [Relief Pilot] in the flight deck for increased situational awareness.		Just after the half way point in our flight, and shortly after the relief pilots took over, during my rest, the aircraft experienced abrupt moderate or greater turbulence that lasted about 30 to 40 seconds. I had just gotten into the overhead crew rest area and was able to buckle into one of the Jump seats. After the ride smoothed out, I went into the cabin to check on the Flight Attendants and Passengers. The Flight Attendants were shaken, but there were no injuries. I called the flight deck and talked to the relief pilots, who had taken the correct action and had requested a lower altitude to get a smoother ride. The Relief Pilots had contacted Dispatch to report the turbulence and while discussing it they determined that it was possibly wake turbulence from an aircraft that was higher and ahead of us. At the time we were in an area of no forecasted or reported turbulence, we were, however, following SOP and (Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure) SLOP 1 mile right of course. The area we were crossing had multiple fragmented jet streams depicted along our route at different altitudes. During the event, the auto pilot remained engaged, and the aircraft maintained altitude. considering the circumstances, the Relief Pilots did an excellent job and the flight continued without further issue.		Two air carrier pilots on break reported noticing the effects of possible wake turbulence on their trans-Pacific flight.

We were descending through approximately 8000 ft prepared for the ILS RWY XX in ZZZ. The ATC changed our runway and approach for RNAV XYR. We received a vector to the new approach and I loaded the new RWY and approach into the FMS. I then realized that the vector takes us through a large thunderstorm cell that was located between the final courses of RWY XX and XYR. We had the discussion about it with the CA (PF) and I expressed my concern to the ATC. I told the ATC that that the vector they gave us takes us right into the cell, that we are not able to continue on that heading and need a new vector around it. The ATC was not cooperative, and even after suggesting a heading that we knew that would work for us, they kept refusing it and gave us vectors back into the severe weather. At this point we had reached the edge of the cell with heavy precipitation and moderate turbulence. We [requested priority] as we needed to turn away from the weather. The CA (PF) disconnected the AP and took a right turn taking us out of the cell. The CA (PF) over banked the aircraft which he immediately corrected for after the over-bank warning. Upon several back and forth communication with the ATC we got cleared back to the ILS RWY XX. We requested extra time to prepare for the approach. The approach to ILS XX and landing commenced without issues.We should have had a better situational awareness about the weather and not accepted the runway change that late on the arrival in these circumstances at first place. I did not realize the severity of the weather and its location until we had already accepted the RWY change. It was surprising to us that the ATC attempted to vector us straight into the bad weather and that they were not helpful finding a way around it. It caught us off guard because ZZZ ATC is usually experienced and extremely cooperative helping to cope with weather in the area. We also speculated that the ZZZ ATCs radars could have not portrayed the same info we had.We should always maintain a good situational awareness and never rely on ATC doing a right thing.				B737-800 First Officer reported the Captain overbanked the aircraft during arrival while maneuvering away from an area of severe weather. Captain corrected overbank and flight continued on approach to landing.

MSL we hit a large bird on the Number #1 Engine. I noticed the roll back on the N1 with about 5 to 6 compressor stalls. Captain immediately reduced power to about 60% N1 and engine continue to operate normally. ATC was busy talking so we squawked and were able to advise ATC and requested vectors back for landing. We discussed our options including running the engine failure and/or severe damage checklist but since the engine was operating, we decided not to. We did run performance numbers for a Flaps 15 landing as a precaution. We requested about a 10-15 mile final to allow us to string the approach and do the necessary briefings including the overweight landing and brake cooling info once on the ground. Approach and landing were uneventful. We exited the runway and had the Fire Department Crew inspect the engine before proceeding to the gate.		We took off on Runway XXR at ZZZ. At about 500' AGL as we were making a turn to our assigned heading of 210, we took a bird in the #1 Engine. We heard a loud thud, then the #1 Engine rolled back momentarily, then had 4 to 5 compressor stalls, I thought we were going to lose it, so I reduced power to about 60% N1 and the compressor stalls ceased. We continued a turn, Tower was busy, so we squawked on the transponder. When he asked, we told Tower what happened, was [requested priority handling], and would be returning. He gave us an initial heading and altitude. The #1 Engine continued to run smooth at the reduced power. There was a burnt burn smell in cockpit and cabin. The First Officer and I discussed our options and decided not to shut it down. We continued our vectors for about a 15-mile final. We ran landing data for a Flaps 15 in case the engine decided later to quit.We made a normal touchdown and stopped momentarily for CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) to do a quick visual inspection. They confirmed debris or stains on engine cowl. After two minutes or so we shut down #1 Engine, then continued to the gate. We ran brake cooling data while taxing to gate and it said MQTW not exceeded. At the gate we notified Dispatch, Maintenance Control, Dispatch Manager, and ZZZ Tower had requested a call. Logbook entries were made for engine, and overweight landing.Suggestion: Paint aircraft like an owl.		Air carrier flight crew reported bird strike on takeoff climb. Returned to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

I was the Flying Pilot of this flight. Climbing through FL210 with autopilot and autothrust on, we experienced a ENG 2 Compressor Vane ECAM. I monitored the aircraft and took ATC communications while the First Officer accomplished the ECAM. I leveled off at FL230 while notifying ATC that we were have an engine issue. We did not [request priority handling] at that point in time. Shortly after this ECAM while the First Officer was going through the ENG2 Compressor Vane ECAM, we received an ENG 2 FAIL ECAM. I subsequently [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center, and told them we needed to return to ZZZ. They responded quickly and gave us a turn back to ZZZ while we maintained FL230. The First Officer and I worked through the ECAMS and checklists associated with the above. As we were completing our checklists, the First Officer called the flight attendants to suspend the cabin service and advise them we were going back to ZZZ. I worked with ATC to give them information they asked for, souls on board, fuel quantity, etc as we progressed back to land. I briefed the flight attendants, told them that no prep of the cabin was needed, and that we should be on the ground in about 20 minutes. I made a PA announcement to the passengers and told them what had happened, what to expect, and that we were returning to ZZZ. ZZZ Approach set us up for a visual landing with ILS backup on [Runway] XX. A successful single engine approach and landing was accomplished. Fire/Rescue equipment followed us upon landing and inspected the aircraft after we cleared the runway. (We were approximately 6000 to 7000 lbs over max landing weight and the temperature was in the mid 90's so I requested they inspect our wheels as the brakes were quite warm.)We were subsequently cleared to taxi to gate with firetrucks in tow. ZZZ Operations gave us our gate assignment and we taxied to complete the flight. After the aircraft was secured at the gate and parking checklist was completed, the First Officer and I took a couple minutes to debrief ourselves before opening the cockpit door. I then went into the cabin to make an announcement to our passengers about what to expect. I was able to coordinate with the gate agents and operations and we then deplaned, the passengers to re-accommodate them. I then debriefed the flight attendants to check on them. After a short time, Company Maintenance arrived at the aircraft. Of note was one of the mechanics that came onboard and made a comment that we really didn't have any engine problem or damage and that "We've seen this kind of thing before." I thought that to be kind of an odd statement with the ECAM screen still showing ENG 2 FAIL.I can't speak for the First Officer, but I felt like he just blew off what had just happened with our aircraft. Enough said about that.				A320 pilot reported engine failure ECAM message and returned to departure airport.

We followed QRH, non-routine landing and overweight landing guidance and landed on ZZZ. After landing BOTH CENTER TANKS FUEL PUMP PRESSURE lights illuminated with around 1200 lbs on Center Tank. We also noticed FUEL FILTER BYPASS lights not illuminated any more. We taxied back to Gate and released ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) from further assistance.Cause: Possible Fuel Contamination.Suggestion: Have an alternate way to check fuel quality.

Shortly after cleanup, we encountered robust wake turbulence and caused a sharp right rolling action. The autopilot disconnected from LNAV mode and transitioned to CWS (Control Wheel Steering) R. The First Officer was flying and appeared to not know how to utilize the CWS R mode to come back to the left. After a brief discussion, I directed the First Officer to come back to the left immediately, due to the proximity to P-56A. To the best of my knowledge, I believe we did not infringe upon the lateral confines of P-56A, but it's hard to discern exactly due to the non-standard shape of the P-56A airspace. We quickly corrected back to course and were not informed of any deviations by ATC.I need to be more directive and perhaps intervene when it appears the First Officer may be confused, and/or slow to correct in the vicinity of P-56A.	Reporter stated the proximity to the restricted area complicated the wake response.	FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying). Upon departure from DCA, Runway 1, REBLL 5 RNAV Departure. ATC cleared us for takeoff and to maintain visual separation from recently cleared (other carrier). Near 1500 [ft.] AGL, we experienced strong wake turbulence causing a rolling moment to the right, automation was engaged, causing the activation of CWS (Control Wheel Steering), and loss of lateral guidance. Initial course correction was delayed and could have been more abrupt. The course was corrected to the left and returned to the departure path. ATC did not mention any abnormality or divergence. As far as we know, the aircraft remained clear of the Restricted Area P-56A. More immediate and efficient crew communication would have assisted with course correction and we de-briefed lessons learned. Additionally, situational awareness would have been improved with use of additional fix info rings to help identify the restricted areas.		B737-700 flight crew reported a track deviation and possible encroachment of a restricted area occurred following a wake turbulence encounter departing DCA.

The F/O also noticed that the cabin altitude was 9800 ft. which is not normal. A search for the correct checklist ensued and shortly thereafter the cabin altitude exceeded 10,000 ft. which caused a high cabin altitude warning to annunciate. We donned our 02 masks and established crew communication via the intercom. The cabin altitude uncontrollable checklist was accomplished. I determined that the cabin altitude was uncontrollable based on the observation that both cabin outflow valves were indicating fully closed. I then determined that an expedited descent to 10,000 was required as the next course of action. [Requested priority handling] followed by a request for a descent to 10,000 ft. We were issued a series of step down clearances which resulted in attaining the requested 10,000 in a timely manner. The descent was accomplished using full speed brakes, idle power, and 310 KIAS. I requested holding at the ZZZZZ intersection so as to weigh our options. There was no apparent deficiencies of our aircraft and we had an abundance of fuel. There were no urgencies at this moment. I conferred with Dispatch, Maintenance Control, ATC, and the flight attendants. I made timely PA announcements. It should also be noted that no passenger O2 masks had deployed as we never reached the 14,000 ft. threshold level. Our timely descent precluded that. Prior to reaching 10,000, the IRO was called back from his break and arrived shortly thereafter. He then provided valuable assistance in our planning.While conferring with Maintenance Control via SATCOM, Maintenance Control stated that they desired we would have attempted to manually close the cabin outflow valves. Doing so, would have allowed the valves to close further he stated, possibly allowing the cabin to become controllable again. My own observations indicated the valves to be fully closed. The checklist we used asked a simple question as to whether the cabin was controllable or not.After consultation with Dispatch a decision was made to divert the aircraft back to ZZZ. The trip would be about 2 hours due to the low altitude. We had an abundance of fuel and an aircraft with no apparent defects. The weather at ZZZZ was 1/4 mi. visibility. We would jettison about 34,000 lbs. of fuel in order to be under our maximum landing weight. Exact information regarding the fuel dumping was sent to Dispatch using the text function of ACARS. While returning to ZZZ, I declined most ATC requests for priority handling. I believed that operating in a normal/routine manner was the best course of action. We then began working on low priority issues in regards to passenger comfort and amenities. We landed in ZZZ using autoland with me flying. While deplaning, I spoke with several Maintenance technicians who inspected our aircraft upon arrival. I was shown a picture of one of the external conditioned air inlets. This inlet was stuck in an open position. This would explain a great many things we observed. In my judgment there would be no way way of pressurizing the cabin sufficiently at a typical cruise altitude.I was very pleased with all who assisted us that night.				Air carrier flight crew flying B777 aircraft reported a malfunction with the pressurization system. Returned to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

The aircraft was on ILS XXR, near 'ZZZZZ', the final approach fix, when we noticed a split flaps indication. The flaps needles split approximately 2mm, with both needles remained in Flaps 30 white band. I executed a go-around with landing gear up and flaps handle remained at flaps 30 due to my knowledge of the QRH 'Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry' where it instructs to set the flaps lever to current/smallest flaps position. Once leveled off at 3,000 feet, I commanded landing gear down to silence the gear horn. The Captain informed me that the flaps needles was no longer split. I verified and commanded flaps 15. The flaps did not move. We ran the QRH 'Trailing Edge Flap Disagree', flaps handle was left at 15. Landing was made with Flaps indicated 30. I did not feel any flaps asymmetry. The aircraft handled exactly like how it should be with Flaps 30. After touching down, as the speedbrake was deploying, I heard what sounded like the T/O config warning horn went off for 1 second. Approach, landing, and rollout were normal. After rollout, we noticed the flaps indicator was showing flaps 15. Post-flight walk around confirmed the flaps were at 15.Because of the intermittent failure (1) it is best leave the flaps at 30 from go-around all the way to the second landing without changing flaps position as they might not extend again. (2) QRH 'Trailing Edge Flap Disagree' does not instruct pilot to move the flaps handle to the current indicated flaps position. The flaps could potentially move from 30 to 15 during approach or landing phase because of the intermittent failure. This could have caused a low-speed event or a tail strike.				B737-800 First Officer reported a flap malfunction while on initial approach. A second approach was completed successfully with a non-standard flap position. The First Officer had 2 suggestions concerning the QRH procedures for this flap malfunction.

I was woken up when I heard "flight attendants take your jumpseats" which appeared to come over the PA into the bunk and the audio from the oxygen mask mic could be heard. I then sensed a descent initiate. A couple of minutes later once the flight attendants were asked to "check in" after reaching a safe altitude, I was then called back into the cockpit via the flight deck. Once I entered back into the flight deck I was briefed of the descent that had occurred as a result of a failure of the pressurization system and a CABIN ALT WARNING. I gathered my bearings and saw we were just outside ZZZZ at 9,000ft. We then started devising a plan together for a diversion and confirmed once again with the cabin crew to ensure everyone was okay and there was no visible damage to the aircraft that could've resulted in our issue. My role at this point as the Relief Pilot was to set up the communications via the SATCOM in preparation for the Captain to speak with Dispatch/Maintenance Control, I also monitored the flight path while the FO (First Officer) flew the aircraft. I commenced obtaining weather information via the sources on my ipad. We entered a hold before we made a decision where to divert. As a crew, along with the input from Dispatch and Maintenance Control we agreed that our best course of action was to return to ZZZ. An alternate of ZZZZ was not favorable due to weather. Once we commenced our diversion since we were overweight we then began the discussion regarding fuel dumping which we later coordinated ATC. We recorded the position and shared with our dispatcher. We then confirmed via our FOM diversion guide that we had considered all possible challenges that came with our situation. Upon arrival, Maintenance inspected the aircraft and advised "Both outflow valves closed, Maintenance confirmed initial findings (found ice in the air hook up, check valve broken and confirmed CABIN ALT WARNING)".				B777 air carrier First Officer reported pressurization system failure in cruise flight and returned to departure airport for uneventful landing.

At ZZZ a fault in the left IRS was noted. Maintenance checked it, deferred it, then we all realized we had to switch the ADIRUs so that we can defer the right IRS instead in order to use the standby instrument per DDG (Dispatch Deviation Guide) compliance/system redundancy. DDG XY-XZ was complied with, however, there were multiple vague operational limitations such as no TOGA of flight directors. Having reading these limitations, we contacted Maintenance Control to get clarification on when, if at all the FDs (Flight Directors) can be turned on. They told us that they cannot be used for the flight, we complied. After multiple phone calls to Dispatch, Maintenance Control, and duty pilot for assistance, the flight was continued with no autopilot, FD, autothrottle, downgraded to CAT I, and we could not fly into IMC conditions due to DDG XY-XZ. This also means we flew into RVSM airspace without autopilot. Enroute, weather into ZZZ1 and our alternate, ZZZ3, went IFR, thus making us divert to ZZZ4 which was VFR. During the diversion on the descent, around FL250, the aircraft went from a wings level descent around 300 knots with speed brakes in flight detent, to a nose high/left bank unusual attitude. The FO stabilized the aircraft with slight oscillation back to a descent wings level attitude. The sensations felt like wake turbulence or mountain wave turbulence with no system failure notifications. About 5 minutes later, during master caution review recall, the FLT Cont light came on, but there were no other lights noted in the flight control panels around 16,000 ft. Crew couldn't run any checklist due to lack of failure specification from the aircraft. Crew landed safely in ZZZ4 with no further issues. Aircraft was issued AOG after further inspection from Maintenance.Cause: Overall cause was ADIRU failures in both left and right sides. Crew decided to go after consulting with Maintenance, Dispatch, duty pilot and good weather forecast.Suggestions: The obstacles that were faced on the flight risked the safety of our operation. The DDG could be more specific with how to operate the aircraft with certain limitations to help the crew make better decisions for a go/no go decision in DDG number XY-XZ.				B737-800 Captain reported a nose high left banked unusual attitude after being established in a wings level descent at approximately 25,000 feet.  Aircraft had an MEL for an ADIRU that presented confusing operational limitations to the crew who made calls to maintenance and operations to clarify restrictions and requirements for Dispatch.  Captain also stated a 'FLT Cont' light illuminated later in descent during Master Caution recall, but that there was no corresponding system anomaly to address.  Reporter stated both ADIRU/IRSs were apparently faulty.

The FO (First Officer) and I ran the appropriate checklists, [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ1. I believe all procedures were followed correctly and the event was handled appropriately. Complete loss of System B hydraulics.		I was the PM (pilot monitoring). Time, day VMC. Flight ZZZ1-ZZZ2 in a -700. While on the ZZZZZ Departure from ZZZ1 climbing through FL 370 we received a Master Caution light due to low pressure on the #2 Engine Driven Hydraulic Pump. We ran the hydraulic pump low pressure checklist and positioned the switch off. After checking the hydraulic pressure and quantity indicators we saw the B system quantity was at zero. Knowing we would lose the remaining pressure in the B system we discussed available options and decided to return to ZZZ1. While coordinating with ATC we lost B system pressure and [requested priority handling]. We ran the Loss of System B Checklist, notified the Cabin Crew, Passengers, Dispatch, and ZZZ1 Operations of the situation and intentions. ZZZ1 was in visual conditions, so we requested Runway XXL for the length and ran the numbers for a Flaps 15 loss of B non-normal landing. Brake cooling data allowed us to park at the gate. We discussed all the inoperative items, requested a 10 mile straight-in to allow time to electrically run the flaps for appropriate configuration, and planned for an overweight landing. After landing we stopped on the runway to verify braking and nose wheel steering were operating normally and notified Fire and Rescue standing by that we would be able to return to the gate unassisted. After parking and deplaning Maintenance discovered hydraulic fluid leaking from draining holes in the tail section. On departure from ZZZ1 aircraft lost all system B hydraulics during climb-out/made safe landing back in ZZZ1.I don't believe there any ways to predict this kind of incident. The biggest take away for me from this situation was that we should have configured the flaps earlier at least to Flaps 5. We started configuring at the 10 mile straight in and had enough time, but it required continuous monitoring during a critical phase of flight.		Air carrier flight crew reported during climb a low hydraulic pressure annunciation illuminated. The B hydraulic system quantity was zero. The pilots returned to the origin airport and accomplished an overweight landing.

When we were switched to Approach, they gave us Runway 27 Left. We changed the runway and re-briefed the approach. As I was reviewing the ATIS and performance numbers as the pilot monitoring, I realized that the glideslope for 27 Left was out of service. The pilot flying decided to change the approach to the RNAV 27L. We were quickly approaching EAGYL on the HOBTT 2 which is the downwind leg, when ATC told us to slow to 210 kt. and then descend to 7,000 ft. As we approach the intersection, we both realize that the aircraft was not going to make the turn. The pilot flying disconnected the autopilot and started a turn to continue on the arrival. Just as we made the turn, we encountered wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft. It caused us to climb and to bank. We momentarily received the bank angle alert. ATC noticed our deviation and gave us a heading to re-intercept the arrival. The pilot flying recovered and got back on speed and continued our descent and we continued the arrival on headings from the Approach Controller. The flight continued without further complications. When I looked at our plan in the box, I saw the discontinuity that was created when we changed the runway to the RNAV 27L. It rebuilt the whole HOBTT 2 Arrival and approach - this caused a discontinuity at EAGYL. The many runway changes and approach changes in the approach environment created a hazard which I should have caught prior to executing the final approach change. As the pilot monitoring, I must verify all changes to the box prior to execution. This is especially important in a high threat environment, such as ATL with multiple runway and approach changes.				B737-700 Captain reported a late runway change resulted in a programming confusion that caused a slight track deviation that was complicated by a wake turbulence encounter on descent into ATL. The Captain, who was pilot monitoring, did not catch the changes in the box that came from the runway change.

Conditions were clear and smooth air.  No ceiling and unlimited visibility. At approximately 9,500 ft. we encountered unexpected severe turbulence that we later determined was caused by the wake of a preceding Airbus A340 approximately 8 miles ahead and to our left. First Officer (FO) pushed nose over to maintain attitude and it started to calm down but when he resumed the climb we got right back into the turbulence. We then immediately offset to our right of course and notified ATC.   Total encounter lasted less than 10-15 seconds and we did not even have time to get out a PA to advise our flight attendants to take their seats immediately. Since we were below 10,000 ft., I had not given them the chime to get up and they were still in their seats. We called back to make sure everyone was OK and that there were no injuries. Everyone was fine, just shaken. We assessed for aircraft damage and the plane seemed to fly fine. All engine indications were normal and after sending a notification to Dispatch we decided the best course of action was to continue to our destination. The rest of the flight was smooth and uneventful. We did make the appropriate maintenance write up regarding the severe turbulence and all of the parameters involved.		Unexpected turbulence.Cleared for takeoff from EDDF Runway 07C - OBOKA1D SID. I was Pilot Flying (PF) and hand flying the SID. We were given free-speed, cleared direct to ODAGA and climb to FL110. We proceeded direct to ODAGA, set FL110 and accelerated to approximately 310 kts in the climb, flight was normal.  During the climb at approximately FL095 we encountered unexpected severe turbulence. Wings remained mostly level, while maintaining pitch attitude was extremely difficult. Do not recall losing altitude, and duration of the event was approximately 15 seconds and went approximately 5 kts into the red band for maybe 3 seconds, received no overspeed warning nor clacker.  The Captain (Pilot Monitoring (PM)) made inquiry/report to controlling agency (EDDF) as we suspected possible wake turbulence from an aircraft to our approximate 11 o'clock position and roughly 8 miles, 2,000 feet above. Captain (PM) asked if was a A380 and ATC advised was a A340. A turn away from the A340 was requested and granted as we suspected possible wake turbulence and a continued climb to FL170. Flight Attendants were in their jumpseats still and passengers were seated, seat belt sign was on (10,000 foot cabin chime had not been given as yet).After the turbulence subsided, the PM immediately checked-in with the Flight Attendants (FA), determined no reports of injuries, and reported the event to Dispatch and Maintenance. We continued the flight as planned, Captain (CA) made a PA to the passengers, and we monitored the aircraft performance and all appeared to be normal. Flight continued normally.		B777 flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence departing EDDF (Frankfurt, Germany) in trail of an A340.

The FO (First Officer) and I had a brief conversation, regarding if we should wait until 1000 ft. to retard the thrust lever and then we retarded the thrust lever. We cleaned up the aircraft and then used the QRC for Engine Limit. We then used the QRH and contacted Dispatch to tell them what happened. They directed us to return to ZZZ and land overweight. We did a Flaps 30 landing and used the performance data for engine cooling to determine that we could taxi to the gate.Suggestion: I'm not sure why the performance data directed a MAX power takeoff. We had 2500 ft. of stopping margin. I wonder what other solutions we could have used that would have used a lower power setting for takeoff.		It was a MAX power takeoff, Runway X at ZZZ. After rotation, above 400 ft. AGL, we noticed the left engine EGT gauge was red. We discussed our course of action to follow and at 1000 ft. AGL, we cleaned up the aircraft and ran the QRC followed by the QRH Engine Limit. The Captain discussed the issue with Dispatch and Maintenance. They recommended for us to return back to ZZZ. The arrival, approach and landing were uneventful. After landing, we ran the brake cooling to determine if we could approach the gate. We parked at the gate where Maintenance met the aircraft.Suggestion: Maybe performance data could prevent from giving us a full power takeoff, when it could be offset with a different flap setting.		B737-800 crew reported engine over temperature on climb out. The crew retarded the thrust lever, returned to the departure airport and landed safely overweight, then taxied to the gate.

The #1 Engine was showing around 14% oil quantity.  On the previous leg we noticed Engine #1 was at 76% oil quantity while #2 was at 98%. We elected to have the oil serviced at ZZZ. Once we noticed #1 was once again low, we realized there was a potential oil leak.  We were directly between ZZZ2 and ZZZ3 and decided to divert to ZZZ3.  As the Pilot Flying, I disconnected the autothrottles and brought Engine #1 to idle in an attempt to preserve oil quantity.  I requested the F/O (First Officer) run landing with one engine inoperative landing data for ZZZ3 Runway XXR.  While in the descent we ran the landing with One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist, but elected to keep engine running at idle as long as it had some quantity. We made an idle descent all the way to the final approach.  The oil quantity continued to slowly decrease. Just inside of the FAF it was showing almost 0. We landed with Flaps 15 and Engine #1 at idle.  There was no low oil pressure or other negative engine indications prior to landing. I shut down #1 Engine shortly after clearing the runway. We then ran the Brake Cooling Checklist.  Cooling was not required.I was surprised there was no low oil quantity checklist in the QRH.  I was also surprised to see very little guidance regarding low oil quantity in the manuals. The way it reads we could have initially continued to ZZZ1. I believe if we didn't make a timely landing, engine damage would have occurred.		I was the First Officer and PM for this leg. This was my first trip after completing IOE and the second day of the trip. In cruise, I noticed a low oil quantity indication and alerted the Captain. He called for a low oil QRH and after a few minutes of both of us looking we determined there was no QRH procedure for our situation. We briefly considered a faulty gauge but decided that it didn't matter and that an immediate diversion was necessary as an oil leak could lead to catastrophic engine failure. We considered ZZZ2 to the NNW and ZZZ3 due west. I am very familiar with the airspace, airport, and general operations of the ZZZ3 area. For that reason and also because we both thought that there was more likely to be available gates, services, and potentially more readily available Maintenance we requested a turn and descent to ZZZ3 due to low oil quantity on the #1 engine. ATC turned us and gave a lower altitude. The Captain was PF (Pilot Flying) and remained so for the flight and so directed me to run standard and single engine landing performance. He also called for the one engine inop QRH. At the same time, we started working through the diversion tasks. Everything happened extraordinarily quickly, and the Captain kept the engine at idle all in an attempt to get the aircraft on the ground before anything developed further. He elected to keep the engine running and at idle in case we needed additional thrust at any point. Oil quantity dropped the entire way to ZZZ3 and even displayed 0 percent on short final. In the process of running, he QRH and rushing to get the other tasks done I began reading the No engine bleeds section which talks about using the APU for bleed air. This confused me and I asked the Captain if I should start the APU to which he replied yes before I realized that it was a section of the QRH that didn't apply to our situation. He said yes because there were other reasons to have it running and virtually no negative reasons to keep us from starting it, but technically I made a mistake in suggesting we should start it to comply with the QRH. We set the aircraft up for landing on [Runway] XXR and entered the single engine data, performed a quick briefing, completed the QRH, briefed Flight Attendants, and talked about a couple of contingency plans. The approach and landing were uneventful, and the Captain immediately shut down the engine with the leak on landing. We ran brake cooling and taxied in the to the gate.As far as the oil leak goes, I don't know. The leg prior to the leak we had noticed the oil had dropped a few percent from our departure to ZZZ flight and since we were in a base the Captain requested a top off for the oil. On my walkaround in ZZZ I did not notice any oil leaking or covering any part of the engine. On my walkaround in ZZZ3, I also did not notice any oil dripping or spilled on the engine, but Maintenance personnel informed us the bottom of the cowling had oil on it. I think I would have had to be on hands and knees to be able to see the oil that had come out of the engine but the lack of any leaking or dripping could have caused me to mistake it for a spill while filling or some oil that blew out in normal operations. For the incorrect QRH usage related to the APU I simply needed to slow down. We didn't really have the ability to create time but slowing down just a little bit likely would have trapped that error.		B737-700 flight crew reported low engine oil quantity in cruise. Flight crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

I pointed this out to the FO (First Officer) (pilot flying), and we continued with normal takeoff procedures. As we approached the bird's position, and the 80-kt. call was not yet made (my attention was focused primarily outside the aircraft), and it did not relocate, as we'd both later discussed was our mutual expectation. Instead, it stayed where it had landed, and only attempted to move as we came within perhaps one or two hundred feet. of it. As we passed its position, we heard and felt a significant impact on the left side, and we elected to abort the takeoff, expecting that damage had likely been done to the engine and/or aircraft at that point. With thousands of feet remaining, we rejected the takeoff by closing the thrust levers, using no reverse, having no autobrake actuation, and nominal/normal braking, and cleared the runway at roughly a midpoint high-speed taxiway, and returned to a gate, to learn that the number one engine had sustained damage.A large bird landing on the runway at or shortly after the time of our receipt of takeoff clearance.I do not recall being trained to consider the presence of non-fixed/mobile obstructions, animate or otherwise, as a reason to decline, cancel, or reject takeoff clearance or a takeoff maneuver, but I do recommend this becoming a training scenario/lesson, as I realize now that simply delaying our takeoff until the trespassing bird could be seen to have evacuated the runway environment would have almost certainly have precluded this incident. I will, from now on, never again attempt a takeoff with any obstruction, living or not, fixed or mobile, within the takeoff flight path.				B737-800 Captain reported a large bird on the runway prior to takeoff. The aircraft hit the bird, rejected takeoff and returned to the gate. The bird strike caused damage to the left engine.

Shot ACARS to dispatch but was unsure if they got it as we had intermittent ACARS NO COMM throughout the flight. Aircraft Y eventually was able to relay to us as they were in trail to ZZZ and were so close they could transmit through the static albeit just barely. Center cleared us for the approach and to land as we descended on the arrival. About that time we switched VHF3 from data to voice and it cleared up all the static and we regained Comms with ATC for an uneventful landing.		Static on VHF1/2 became so bad that we couldn't understand ATC's transmissions. Initial troubleshooting didn't resolve the static. We changed the transponder to 7600. Eventually the aircraft behind us inbound to ZZZ, Aircraft Y (barely understandable through the static), became a relay for ATC to us. ATC had us change back to our previous squawk. While continuing to troubleshoot on the arrival, we changed VHF3 from DATA to ATC's freq, the static on all of our VHF radios cleared. We resumed normal Comms with ATC from approximately the FAF onward. The rest of the flight was uneventful.		B737NG flight crew reported VHF Comm radios 1 and 2 developed feedback and static, resulting in lost contact with ATC.

We complied with instructions and were turned on course shortly after. The remainder of the flight was uneventful.Seeing '8' on the clearance led us to set 8,000 on the MCP. A more thorough review of the SID may have trapped that error. Checking in with departure climbing to 8,000 ft. could have caught the error or better situational awareness might have made us question the lower altitude.		Clearance was cleared as filed, climb via the SID, expect Runway X. The top altitude on the SID was 20,000 however we mistakenly set 8,000 and neither pilot caught this error. Weather was VFR. When I checked in with departure control I stated 'altitude passing for 8,000' expecting to be cleared higher or unrestricted climb but received neither.

The flight departed the gate about 4 minutes early at XA:34 with 252 souls on board and about 178,000 lbs of fuel. Takeoff weight was 558,000 lbs. There were no traffic delays getting to the runway, and the flight was cleared for takeoff on runway XXL at XA:51. I was the pilot flying. All indications were normal. Weather was good visibility, with an overcast layer around 1,000. Above 100 knots I began smelling something abnormal. The relief pilot called out "smoke in the cockpit" around 130 knots. The CA (Captain) glanced up to the ceiling verifying the smoke and rejected the takeoff, at about 135 knots. All rejected takeoff functions worked properly (Rejected Takeoff auto brakes, auto spoiler, reversers, etc.) and the aircraft slowed quickly. I called 80 knots and 60 knots, then informed tower of the rejected takeoff and indication of smoke. The CA applied manual brakes and slowed to a slow roll. We determined the smoke had stopped when the thrust levers were retarded, and decided to clear the runway. After clearing the runway we continued to complete the post high-speed reject tasks. We communicated with passengers, flight attendants, tower, emergency vehicles, company, and among the crew. We didn't set the parking brake and remained rolling on the adjacent taxiway until the wheels were chocked by emergency personnel. After emergency personnel cooled the brakes and it was determined it was safe to move the aircraft, the plane was towed to a hard stand and parked. No tires failed, and maximum brake temperature never got into the red (about 6.1). Maintenance came on board and passengers were deplaned. The smoke was coming primarily from the cockpit grasper vents, and most were closed except one over my head in front of the relief pilot. The relief pilot said he saw the smoke pouring out of the vent. The smoke only started sometime after takeoff thrust was applied and a higher speed was attained, and stopped when thrust was retarded to idle. After the reject, the APU was started to provide aircraft air conditioning. I opened my window. The smoke was not perceived in the cabin, except perhaps a slight odor, and it dissipated quickly. After the rejected takeoff, the smoke was not thick enough to warrant donning masks, however after deplaning I realized I had breathed enough smoke during the reject to cause burning and irritated lungs and burning eyes. Cough and lung irritation persist 5 days later.Smoke must have originated in the left engine, engine bleed, or cockpit air conditioning system.The event occurred because of mechanical failure. I was impressed with the crew's performance. I wonder if outsourcing our maintenance to low-cost foreign shops has reduced the mechanical reliability and safety standards of our airline.		The FO (First Officer) was taking off, at around 80 knots I began to smell what I thought was jet fumes from the preceding departure. The smell began getting stronger. At about 130 knots the relief pilot called out "smoke in cockpit". I glanced up and could see smoke between me and the overhead panel in a dark cockpit. The smell was quite strong now. I announced "reject", took control of the airplane, RTO (Rejected Takeoff) and thrust reversers were used until about 80 knots. I then went to idle on the thrust reversers and went to manual braking. The smoke appeared to subside when power was reduced. We taxied off the runway very slowly, allowing the wheels to continue rotating without use of brakes. I made a PA to the passengers to remain seated while we assessed the situation. I then called the number 1 FA (Flight Attendant) and explained we had smoke in the cockpit and asked about their status in the back. We requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to meet the airplane on our remote taxiway to check our brakes. The relief pilot suggested to monitor our brake temps. I then made another PA stating that due to stopping such a heavy airplane at a high speed our brakes would be very hot and we had requested safety vehicles to come inspect our brakes. I advised dispatch via ACARS that we had aborted at 135 knots due smoke in cockpit. About 5 minutes after stopping, we received a hot brakes message and completed the associated Checklist. We opened a cockpit window to allow fresh air in. ARFF arrived, chocked the wheels and requested us to shut down engines, do not apply brakes and inspected brakes with thermal imagery. They then put fans on wheels to cool them down. Brakes 1 and 7 got the hottest at 6.1. Once the brakes cooled, a tug towed us to a remote park stand and the passengers were deplaned. Maintenance came onboard and we explained that the smoke was coming from the overhead grasper and subsided when power was reduced. Then called dispatch via sat phone and explained the occurrence to them. About 30 minutes after this all happened, all flight deck members began having burning lungs and compressed chests. The FO also had a slight cough. Symptoms continued into the next day and we were advised to receive medical attention. A visit to hospital was arranged where we were informed of just inflamed lungs and then removed from our return flight home.		B-777 crew reported smoke from the cockpit air vents during the takeoff roll. The Captain rejected the takeoff, the smoke dissipated after stopping the aircraft, and taxied back to the gate after brake cooling.

We saw a potential aircraft ahead and ATC issued a turn. (which made things worse). As we started the turn we were 500 feet above the threat aircraft and received a climb RA. Complied with procedures according to training (autopilot/autothrottle off, transition smoothly from decent to a climb. We got within 100 feet vertical separation.Cause: Failure to intervene sooner. This is prohibited in training, and we flew like we were trained, which led to reduced separation. I recently completed training where SOP's and standardization were drilled into us (at the expense of being a pilot and dealing with the situation at hand). The training on this made us less safe.Suggestions: Change the way company trains pilots. What we do and compliance with checklists should be emphasized, not what we say or memorizing (see decades of NASA research on memorized tasks) flows, often at inappropriate times. The TCAS training is negative training. We are trained to wait for the RA, which is what we did, which caused a 100 foot vertical separation. Waiting for the RA to act is wrong and should NOT be part of the training.				B737-800 flight crew reported NMAC with another aircraft while in descent. Flight crew took evasive action.

Just past ZZZZZ, and on course, we were slowing the aircraft and selected flaps 1 on arrival and approaching ZZZZZ1 on the RNAV RWY XX.  We experienced a MASTER CAUTION and HYD Annunciator message.  At that moment we had a Hydraulic B engine driven pump LOW PRESSURE light illuminated on the overhead panel.  We also looked at the lower display unit and saw that our HYD B quantity was at 0, We followed the QRH procedures and turned off the HYD B Engine driven pump.  Moments later we then received a Hyd B ELEC Pump LOW PRESSURE light along with a FLT CONTROL B LOW PRESSURE light.  Knowing that we then had a loss of HYD B system I [requested priority handling].  At that point I referenced the QRH of LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics (the FO was PF).  As events unfolded, we wanted to slow the aircraft and extended flaps 5.  We also put the gear down and selected flaps 15.  At this point we were past ZZZZZ1 and on an approximately 8-10 mile final descending and slowing.  I referenced the LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics and ensured we had ample runway available with the aircraft configuration.  Made a reference to the list of the inoperative items.  And made the determination to land with the runway insight.  I made the determination to continue the approach and land while considering the condition of the aircraft, the terrain of the surrounding airport, and thunderstorms in the proximity of the area and felt our (my) considerations had the greatest margin of safety for safely landing under the conditions.  As part of my considerations, I determined that it was the safest course of action to continue the approach without completing the entire QRH procedure for the LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics.  Our flaps were selected to 15 but because of the loss of system B they only extended to approximately 12-13 degrees.  I determined with reference to the landing data that without the extra 2-3 degrees would still safely allow us ample landing distance.  I took control of the aircraft and landed.  We were met by airport emergency equipment.  We taxied to the gate and deplaned uneventfully.  Cause: We had a loss of hydraulic B system while on arrival into approach.  We had been flying around thunderstorms and into an airport that had terrain considerations.  Because of where the event occurred (as far as where we were on the approach, altitude and airspeed) we had very little time to make decisions.  And my decision was the safest course of action was to continue and land as we were a priority aircraft flying into and airport that was terrain challenged and had thunderstorms in the area.  The weather forecasts were also calling for the weather to move over the field.		On the approach to Runway XX (RNAV XX) and just approximately 3 miles prior to the final approach fix, while configuring for flaps , The MASTER CAUTION and HYD Annunciator came on. Initially hydraulic B engine driven pump, LOW PRESSURE lights illuminated . Upon looking at the lower display unit we saw HYD  B quantity was indicating zero.  As per QRH, the B engine driven pump was turned off.After this we got HYD B ELEC Pump LOW followed by FLT CONTROL B LOW PRESSURE light.(loss of B Sys).I the PF continued flying to aircraft while the PM( CPT) [requested priority handling] and following QRH. We landed with Flaps Approximately 13 degrees uneventfully .Cause: Due to the circumstances of weather and terrain, we decided to continue, and due to first officer restrictions , the captain landed the Aircraft uneventfully.		B737 air carrier flight crew reported loss of hydraulics on descent. Flight crew landed uneventfully at destination.

Climbout continued as I noticed the left fuel tank quantity rolling back like a countdown timer with the center and right tanks remaining stable. QRH for 'Fuel Imbalance' procedures were followed up to shutting down the left engine. We paused there since we were turning final for Runway XXL at ZZZ and the aircraft was stable and the imbalance was no longer increasing at a rapid rate. After landing we shut down the left engine and allowed ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to examine the aircraft. ARFF crew verified fuel was not leaking, we single engine taxied to the alley and towed to gate with ARFF supervision. The maintenance crew informed me that they had been called out by the fueling crew for an imbalance condition before the flight however when they arrived the fuel was properly loaded. Cause: Unknown. Post flight review indicates that both engines were being fed by the left fuel tank with all pumps on and cross feed closed. Suggestion: Unknown cause. Early recognition and starting the checklist before getting the fuel imbalance indication maintained the aircraft in a controllable configuration.		Shortly after arriving to the airplane to start the day, 2 Maintenance members came on the plane and asked me about a fuel imbalance that they received and were called out to check on. All three of us looked at the fuel quantity that was already put on the airplane and it showed the correct amount of gas that we needed for the flight and it was balanced and checked out fine. When everything was finished with boarding and the front door was shut, we pushed back like normal and taxied to [Runway] XXR for departure. Shortly after departure, the Captain was flying and noticed that the plane was requiring a lot more rudder and aileron to keep the airplane flying straight. Shortly after departure, the fuel imbalance indication came up on the left fuel tank which got both of ours attention for which we saw a super fast decrease in fuel coming from the left tank. We continued the departure while we started to decide what we wanted to do. I got into the QRH with the Fuel Imbalance Checklist and proceeded with the checklist. We got all the way up to "shutting down the engine" and stopped because we were already turning back to ZZZ and we made the decision to not shut it down because we were close to the airport and had plenty of fuel in the tanks. After doing the checklist, the decrease in fuel was finally stable and was not decreasing like it was before. We [requested priority handling] and landed on XXL and came to a full stop. The ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) trucks approached the airplane while we were stopped on the runway to make sure we weren't leaking fuel and everything was safe. After getting the ok from ARFF, we taxied into the gate with ARFF following us all the way. Cause: The 2 Maintenance team members came onto the airplane right after I got on the plane to ask about a fuel imbalance that they received to come out and investigate. After all 3 of us looked at the fuel quantity and seeing that it was full and balanced, they left and I started doing my preflight tasks. After departure and the fuel imbalanced came up with the amount decreasing so rapidly, it made things weirder that the fuel was imbalanced during refueling, showed fine on the ground, and then became imbalanced again in the air. Suggestion: Ask more questions when the Maintenance members came out to investigate a fuel imbalance call. They came and saw it was fine and all 3 of us were ok when we saw it fine. I should have asked more questions about who reported the fuel imbalance, when did the person see it was imbalance, and did the completed fueling cause the fueler to see it fine and then leave.		During departure climb air carrier flight crew reported the left fuel tank showing a high rate of fuel consumption compared to the right tank. Flight crew elected to return to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

Captain handed the aircraft and radios to the FO (First Officer). I assisted the captain in running the appropriate checklist. We were unable to reset the generators. Upon a conversation with dispatch and maintenance control, we decided to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ. We jettisoned fuel and landed with no further incident.		Climbing through approximately FL230 towards ZZZZZ on the ZZZZZ1.ZZZZZ SID had a master caution with a right generator fail. Checklist was accomplished and the generator initially reset.  Within 1 minute the right generator failed again, accompanied shortly thereafter with left generator fail and left IDG (Integrated Drive Generator) disconnect.  APU was started and appropriate checklists followed. [Advised ATC] and received ATC clearance to ZZZZZ2 and descent to 15,000 ft.  At approximately 40NM North of ZZZZZ2 and 15,000 ft dumped fuel down to a total of 92,000 lbs to get below overweight landing criteria. Once fuel dumping was complete, got an ATC clearance for an ILS approach to runway XXR at ZZZ. Flew a flaps 30 approach with auto brakes 3 selected. Landed at approximately 455,000 lbs, taxied clear and didn't need any further assistance from ground personnel. Taxied uneventfully to gate, shut down the aircraft and completed all appropriate checklists.		Air carrier pilots reported a dual generator failure on their B-777 aircraft. The APU was started for electric power, ATC provided priority handling and a return to the origin airport was completed.

MEL-XX-XX-XX center tank systems PUMPS had been applied to the aircraft and all operational procedures were complied with. Once the center was empty the fuel cross feed was selected Off. There is a note in the MEL which says "NOTE: In certain situations, it is possible for a fuel imbalance to develop while operating under the Procedure guidance for this MEL. Monitor fuel load to ensure a significant imbalance does not occur." After the center tank emptied we completed the MEL Procedure to turn off the cross feed and a systems check showed both left and right tanks were within 100 lbs of each other. Our attention was then diverted due to weather that required multiple deviations to avoid. Shortly after we cleared the weather we were alerted to the imbalance situation by a Fuel L Wing TK LO LVL ECAM. Followed by a. FUEL IMBALANCE ECAM. The fuel page displayed 1420lbs in the left tank and 12100 in the right tank. We ran the fuel imbalance QRH and landed with 1420 lbs in the left tank and approximately 6000 lbs in the right tank. There were no controllability issues throughout the landing sequence. We were so focused on the WX radar and the weather outside the aircraft for that the last hourly systems check for was approximately an hour and a half before we got the ECAMS.				Air carrier flight crew reported fuel imbalance in cruise. Flight crew landed uneventfully at destination.

We had been held up, which is not unusual, and immediately advised them we would not make the altitudes on the STAR. ATC then told us to disregard speeds and just make ZZZZZ at 12000 ft. We told them we would do our best but might be too high. The First Officer (FO), who was Pilot Flying, placed 6000 ft. in the altitude window and hit speed intervention-300 kias and brought the speed brakes out to make an attempt at it. They started to stow the speed brake from the flight detent to the 50%. We analyzed the problem, put 12000 ft. in the altitude window and went to level change as we continued the descent. Not finding anything new or any reason why it did this, we elected to try to put it back in VNAV. It took and then we put 6000 ft. in the altitude window. As the altitude at ZZZZZ looked like we were going to make it, the First Officer began to slowly bring the speed brakes to the up position. Within the last 2 inches of stowage, the aircraft abruptly went hard nose up and power began increasing. For about .5-2 (max) seconds, this happened until the autopilot kicked itself off. Two Flight Attendants were injured and one passenger. The seat belt sign was on during the event and the Flight Attendants were collecting trash for their final because I was sitting them early. Upon finding out that we had injuries onboard, we advised Dispatch and asked for Inflight Supervisors, as well as Customer Service Supervisor, to meet the aircraft. We asked Operations over the radio to have EMS to meet the aircraft at the gate. Suggestion: You know, I wrote that aircraft up and until it is resolved as to why this malfunction occurred, I would not put it back into service. We discussed being high, before ATC gave us the descent. I did not accept it, so really, I do not think that is a factor. This happened so quickly that I am not sure how to fix this problem.		Before the event and descent. The seatbelt sign was on, and the Flight Attendants were given a five-minute heads up before some bumps going into ZZZ. After being left high due to traffic, we received a descend via clearance. The Captain told ATC we would be high at the altitudes. ATC said we could delete the speeds and just make the altitude at the ZZZZZ point. I started the descent using VNAV automation and using the speed brakes to increase our descent. As we were getting closer to being on PATH; I moved the speed break handle from flight detent to 50% position. At this point, the lateral navigation on the FMA changed from VNAV SPD to control pitch. At that point we were puzzled at this in the auto motion. We then selected level change. Once we got the aircraft back in the descent, we selected VNAV again. I saw we were still getting back to our PATH, I moved the speed breaks smoothly to the down position. Once the speed break handle went into down position, the autopilot immediately pulled the nose and the auto throttles advanced as it was starting a quick climb and then the autopilot disengaged. I disconnected the auto throttles and pushed the nose over smoothly and controlled the aircraft. After controlling the aircraft, we resumed our descent. We left the autopilot off until everything was controlled and smooth, then re-engaged the autopilot and auto throttles and continued the arrival without the use of any speed brake usage. The rest of the flight was uneventful with the automation being used. During the event though, two Flight Attendants were injured during their trash service and one passenger was injured with the seatbelt sign on.		737-700 flight crew reported an un-commanded auto pilot pitch up during descent.

We had been cleared for takeoff behind an (other carrier) aircraft, and believed we were experiencing possible wake turbulence. We were also scanning for possible erroneous airspeed indications and disagree. The aircraft control was first priority. As the low speed alerts discontinued we proceeded to configure the aircraft appropriately. The landing gear was still extended and at first we attributed this to a lapse during the initial climb, due to our concentration on aircraft control. After I had some time to reflect on the different possibilities, I believe I may have inadvertently raised the flaps out of takeoff setting too early, instead of the landing gear. I can't explain why this may have happened, other than a lapse in concentration, if what I fear may be the cause of the alerts.				B737-700 First Officer reported distraction from a possible wake turbulence encounter led to a low airspeed event departing PHX.

On climb-out, around 10,000 ft. the mini-engine display appeared and the oil quantity indicator on the right engine began slowly counting down from around 80. During the oil quantity decline, there were no other indications of an engine event, other than the quantity being highlighted white. No oil pressure light or indication, oil temp or vibration coming from the engine. We continued the climb to our final cruise of 19,000 ft. and reviewed the QRH in preparation for the event that something might happen. The QRH references that the LOW OIL PRESSURE light may or may not be illuminated. During the whole event we did not see the OIL PRESSURE light illuminate. We ran the one step for ENGINE LOW OIL PRESSURE which refers you to the Engine Failure Checklist if the pressure is at or below red line. The pressure was still within limits - green - and had not declined at all from the comparable left engine pressure.The quantity continued to count down and when it got to around 20%, we asked for priority handling to ZZZ1, a shortcut, but we did not declare an emergency. We were given direct ZZZZZ for the RNAV XXL or somewhere thereabouts and we were given a descent. It was around then that the oil quantity indicator reached 0%, still with no other indications. The QRH was on the dashboard, opened up and ready to go. During the initial descent, the oil quantity actually counted back up to 20% and fluctuated up and down. We got the ATIS and landing data for ZZZ1 Runway XXL and briefed a Flaps 40 visual landing. The landing distance available for Flaps 40 was around 1,400 ft. with brakes MAX, wet runway. It was very visual conditions in ZZZ1 with a light wind out of the west and a 5-WET GOOD field report for Runway XXL. We briefed the arrival and approach and ran the Descent and Approach Checklists.  It was around this time that the oil pressure indicator on the mini display rapidly went to zero. The mini display rapidly flashed white, then amber, then red and the engine temperature began to climb on the mini display. Captain called for the Engine Shutdown Checklist and [asked for assistance] with ZZZ1 Approach. The Shutdown Checklist went uneventfully. We were below 10,000 ft. at this time and we may have exceeded the 250-kt. speed limit, but neither of us could recall by what small margin and for how long. We had five hours of fuel onboard - we were tankering 15,000 lb. We briefed the flight attendants and made an announcement to the passengers.By this time, we were on the approach for [Runway] XXL and had ZZZ1 in sight with a single-engine configuration. We ran the landing data for a single-engine landing on [Runway] XXL and noticed that the landing distance available was an acceptable margin with the very favorable VFR conditions. We discussed diverting to ZZZ2 and agreed upon continuing the approach to ZZZ1, with the plan of executing an early missed approach to [Runway] XXL if we were uncomfortable or outside the parameters of a stable approach with the plan of immediately diverting to ZZZ2. The approach, final approach, and landing were normal. We touched down with brakes MAX and exited Runway XXL at our normal exit for this runway. We taxied to the Ramp and had Crash Fire and Rescue inspect the engine for heat or damage - there was none - and continued in to park at the gate.In conclusion, I am proud of the way this event played out. I was comfortable with our plan to continue the approach considering both my experience and Captain's, not only with the 737 but also with flying into ZZZ1. We had discussed all options and eventualities within the short time available and I was satisfied with our "Plan B" as well as a "C."This event unfolded very slow but with a very rapid conclusion. It very much reminded me of the loft where we had to decide rapidly between ZZZ3 and ZZZ4 with a fire on board. I think more training with this type of slow engine failure would be helpful.				B737-800 First Officer reported performing an inflight engine shutdown due to low oil pressure. The flight crew then diverted to an alternate airport.

We had loaded the RNAV Z to Runway XX, and at the time of notification the next fix in sequence for us was ZZZZZ1 at or above 3,200 ft. If I remember correctly, we were at approximately 3,400 ft. at the time, in VNAV PATH with autopilot engaged. I don't recall what altitude we crossed ZZZZZ at. Conditions were clear skies and airport was in sight. A contributing factor to the situation was a similar callsign we had been following for the last hour directly in front of us, other carrier flight. In the future, I will pay greater attention to extending final off the appropriate waypoint, and double checking crossing altitudes.				Air carrier Captain reported receiving a low altitude alert from ATC due to descending below a crossing restriction on the approach.

There was a 757 in front of us that was causing some wake turbulence. The Captain, pilot flying, decided to slow from the assigned speed of 170 to 150 in order to increase separation. We had about a 3-mile spacing and the 757 was slowing early it appeared. Shortly thereafter, ATC asked if we were doing 170 and we responded "affirmative." When they asked again, the Captain jumped on and said he was doing 150 for wake spacing. ATC implied that we had more than enough, and we landed without incident. Pilot flying slowed 20 kt. below assigned speed to avoid wake turbulence without clearance to do so. We should have asked for slower instead of just doing it. Better crew communication. We could have also gone around and tried again with a better buffer.

I followed the fuel flow checklist following all appropriate steps which hyperlinked me to the one engine Inoperative Landing Checklist. Planned landing weight was below MLW and the Non-Normal Configuration Landing Distance table was reviewed for landing data.  Conducted the RNAV XL into ZZZ. We completed some delay vectors to run appropriate checklists and to brief the Flight Attendants (FAs). Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) equipment was standing by on landing, once clear of the runway parking brake was set and I requested the ARFF unit verify we had no fire or smoke, they did advise fuel was leaking from the bottom of the nacelle. ARFF units followed us to the gate as a precaution. We parked and shutdown and deplaned the passengers.

We departed ZZZ on Runway XX. I was the PF (Pilot Flying). While hand flying the aircraft after flap retraction, climbing through approximately 5,000 ft MSL, I noticed the electric stab trim, specifically the nose down function was no longer working. The nose up electric trim was still functioning. I asked my FO (First Officer) if his trim switches were working normally. He operated his electric trim switches and had the same issue. We asked for and received clearance from ATC to level off at 10,000 ft. We informed ATC of our flight control issue and asked for vectors to remain in close proximity to ZZZ2. We ran the QRH checklist for Stabilizer Trim inoperative. Upon completion of the checklist, we decided to divert to ZZZ2 due to the longer runways available for landing at flaps 15, as required by the checklist. We informed ATC of our decision to divert to ZZZ2, and [requested priority handling]. With the autopilot unavailable, I flew the remainder of the flight using manual trim on the trim wheel. We accomplished the non-routine landing considerations checklist, relayed our decision to Dispatch, informed the Flight Attendants and passengers of our need to land at ZZZ2, performed a landing assessment, and the before landing checklist. We flew a normal ILS approach and landed safely at ZZZ2 on Runway XYL. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) met us on the high speed taxiway after we exited the runway and inspected the aircraft. After their inspection, finding no signs of damage or distress, they followed us to the gate. Cause: Aircraft malfunction.		Aircraft X departed ZZZ on Runway XX. After takeoff and climbing through 5,000 ft MSL (approximately), after the flaps had already been retracted and the PF (Pilot Flying) still hand flying the aircraft. The PF noticed the electric stab trim, specifically the nose down function did not work. The crew then stopped the climb and leveled off at 10,000 ft. The PM (Pilot Monitoring) ran the QRH checklist for Stabilizer Trim inoperative. Upon completion of the checklist, the crew decided to divert to ZZZ2 due to the longer runways available for landing at flaps 15.

CA (Captain)/PF (Pilot Flying) was cleared for the visual. On Autopilot, he gave himself a shallower intercept angle to final to maintain good separation with parallel traffic. We observed one "Traffic, traffic" call during the turn to intercept, with no RA. Once on final and tracking the localizer, he called for, and I set TA only as per Company policy. Cleared to land from the tower with no intervening radio calls from ATC. Landed without incident.		ZZZ Tower cleared us off the arrival for a Visual to Runway XXR. They reported traffic behind and below us for Runway XXL. The spacing seemed tight so I had my FO (First Officer) go to TA only on the transponder as per company policy. Because I felt the spacing was tight I shallowed out the intercept that I had been given by tower. Also, because I felt like the other plane was gaining. I told my FO I was going to keep my speed up for a little longer than normal. An uneventful landing ensued. I received a call from a flight safety organization representative who informed me that the following aircraft Captain had called them to report a near midair. I discussed the approach with him. He texted later to inform me that Tower stated that our aircraft had overshot the final approach course.  I did not (nor did my FO) feel that we had overshot the final approach course.

Apparent alcohol or hand sanitizer type. After discussion with Crew, we agreed to proceed with flight, as it seemed to fade and present no concern. There was a NOTAC for HAZMAT for battery transport, but this didn't seem to fit with the smell detected. During cruise, Flight Attendants noted a much stronger "acetone" type of smell, mid cabin to aft. A passenger became ill, complaining of headache and dizziness. A phone patch with medical services was initiated. During this time the C Flight Attendant also began to experience symptoms of headache and nausea. After consulting with medical services, we were told that due to multiple persons being affected, a diversion was advisable. We elected to divert. After an initial turn towards ZZZ, Dispatch advised that ZZZ1 would be a better divert location for manning and EMT capabilities. We initiated a turn towards ZZZ1 and coordinated with Dispatch for Medical Personnel to meet the aircraft. We [requested priority handling] as well. As the divert continued, we were informed by the Flight Attendants that the C F/A was vomiting in the Lavatory. We relayed all of the above info to Dispatch and coordinated for a gate. No smell was noted on the flight deck so no Emergency Checklists were deemed necessary. This may have been an error, and perhaps the smoke or fumes checklist would have been advisable, under an abundance of caution. Arrival to ZZZ1 was uneventful. EMT met the Aircraft at the gate and serviced the ill Passenger and Flight Attendants. O2 bottles were used during the flight for the Passenger and F/A.		[Report narrative contained no additional information.]		Air carrier flight crew reported an 'acetone' type odor during cruise in the passenger cabin which resulted in multiple reports of physiological symptoms. With no definitive source of the odor the flight crew requested special handling to a diversion airport where a safe landing was executed.

As we could not maintain visual contact with the traffic behind us ATC told us the Airbus would maintain visual separation with us. We lost sight of the Airbus as we joined our final approach course just slightly ahead of the other traffic. I was hand-flying and was slightly, approximately one dot on the localizer, right of course, north, aware that the Airbus was almost abeam us when they joined the [Runway] XXL course to our left. Soon after we received a TCAS TA. On our MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) the traffic appeared directly under our position 100 ft. below us. Very soon after receiving the TA we received a TCAS RA instructing us to level off. We complied with the RA and subsequently executed a go-around. During the RA go-around my FO (First Officer) stated he briefly had visual contact with the Airbus slightly behind and below our left wing. Had we used the company endorsed policy of selecting TA ONLY mode on the TCAS we may have descended into the conflicting traffic that appeared to have been north of their final approach course.

Subsequent approach and landing without incident		ZZZ [airport] R-Nav XXVFR NightI was Pilot Flying, 62 hours in type.We arrived from the West and requested the Rnav XX. ATC offered it from ZZZZZ or Vectors. Iaccepted vectors. We were told to maintain to 3200 ft; until established and cleared forapproach. The next fix was in 2 miles and 2200 ft. I was fast and in selected speed at 210, Flaps1. I armed approach and saw final app but no blue brick. By the time I realized and questionedno blue brick, the CA had the same question and pulled up the prog page and learned we were750 ft high and fast. I spun the speed to 170 KTS and asked for gear down we slowed and got theflaps to 2 before the the FAF which was supposed to be 1600 ft but we were extremelyhigh. I had full boards until the VLS crept up and I retracted them. I am still in Auto pilot at thispoint and confused by the automation when the GS didn't capture. I am becomingprogressively behind the aircraft. The CA is verbally directing me to turn auto pilot off, pitch for170 KTS, full boards and get down. The flight director is providing bad data and I am attempting toread my instruments and look outside all while listening to the Captains directives. I shouldhave gone around long before this point. I had lost most SA (Situational Awareness) at this point and was trying tocompute where we were in regards to the glide slope, the Captain believes he heard anobstacle alert. I was behind a bit while hand flying believing I could stabilize the approach by500 ft. I was startled and surprised and did not respond promptly thus the Captain took theaircraft and called the go around. Once climbing out he returned the controls to me. We werevectored back for the approach. I had recognized ATC was leaving us high again and betterprepared by slowing and putting the flaps 2 in. I am flying with automation on. Once cleared Iarmed the approach however the approach was not sequenced properly in the box and wasnot arming. I stated I had the runway in sight and needed to disconnect the auto pilot. TheCaptain said to keep the auto pilot on while he was programing the box. The approach wasstill not arming, we were cleared visual and I flew in heading mode until established and Idisconnected the autopilot to descend since the GS did not capture. We met the stabilizedapproach criteria and landed uneventfully.What I could have [done] better:I would request to start from the initial fix and not vectors.I would recognize and verbalize we were high on final and fast.I would call a go around at the FAF since we were still high.I would have better situational awareness to react to any possible obstacle alert.All around we could have better practiced communication and automation management.		Air carrier flight crew reported improper automation and aircraft control management by an inexperienced First Officer resulting in an unstable approach. The Captain took control of aircraft and performed an upset recovery maneuver followed by a go-around and landing.

The PF (Pilot Flying) incorrectly input the direction of the holding turn in the FMS, and executed the hold before PM (Pilot Monitoring) confirmation. When the aircraft turned the incorrect direction, the PF disengaged the autopilot to correct the turn direction. While correcting the turn, the airplane banked beyond 30 degrees, and the Bank Angle aural warning was triggered. In addition the aircraft had slowed to holding speed, and the PLI symbology appeared on the PFD, warning of an approach to stall speeds. No stall indications occurred. While the PF was correcting the bank angle, I manually increased the speed to 250 kt, well above the indicated stall speed. I set up the flight director panel for the PF, and he then re-engaged the auto pilot. The aircraft was stable in holding after the autopilot was re-engaged. After one 360 degree turn in holding ATC cleared us direct to the beginning of the STAR. The rest of the flight and landing was uneventful. The unexpected and short notice holding clearance paired with the PF not confirming the FMS programming before executing were causal factors. In addition, the PF disconnecting the autopilot, instead of correcting with Heading mode compounded the confusion and workload on the flight deck. Following company SOPs on FMC data entry, along with maximizing the proper use of automation would have prevented these errors.				Air carrier pilot reported a temporary loss of aircraft control caused by an incorrect aircraft handling while correcting a heading deviation. The airspeed and heading deviations were corrected which enabled the flight to continue uneventfully.

Each step and subsequent vector was to line us up for the approach and spot traffic. We were told to spot a E175 at 9 o'clock joining the approach for Runway 28R. We called traffic in sight and were cleared to 4000 ft.  After we leveled at 4000 ft. we were told this traffic we had in sight was breaking off the approach and there was now new traffic to spot, 10:30-11:00. We were to follow them into SFO. We DID NOT see the traffic. We continued on the lateral course but not allowed lower due to traffic not in sight. So on we went, with Approach continuing to call out the position of the traffic to no avail. We could not see this aircraft.  When we finally spotted them, they were low so as to be VERY hard to discern from the terrain below. By then it was too late. We got the approach clearance and began to chase the vertical path. By 1000 ft. we were not stabilized and we went around.  By the time we came back and landed on 28L, 2 other aircraft had gone around for reasons unknown. Again, it was a VFR day. Finally, coming into land on 28L, Tower decides to line up a 777 on 28L prior to our arrival. Spacing is such that I tell the First Officer 'this will get ugly'. It did. The 777 was cleared for immediate when we were a mile out. By the time he was lifting off we were crossing the threshold of 28L and had the ride of our lives until I managed to touchdown. Honestly, I thought about going around when we hit it, but looking at their flight path on the climb and what ours would be, I felt it safest to wrestle my aircraft to the ground.				A320 Captain reported experiencing considerable instability on short final at SFO due to the B777 on the takeoff roll in front of them.

We ran the QRH Checklist Transfer Bus Off. As we were progressing through the checklist, the #1 Transfer Bus Off light was becoming more frequent and more persistent. In accordance with QRH, we confirmed we were in operational limits to start and use the APU for electrical. The limit is 41,000ft. and we were at 39,000ft. We started the APU and put the #1 bus on the running APU. This worked for a number of minutes, and we completed the checklist, notified Dispatch and in accordance with QRH, planned to continue to ZZZ1. The APU accomplished an auto-shutdown, and the provided power fell offline. In accordance with 737AOM, APU limitations, we attempted to start the APU again. It stayed on for about two minutes, then auto-shutdown again. We returned to the QRH and followed the APU is not available branch. This directed us to plan to land at the nearest suitable airport. At this point in the flight, the nearest suitable airport in terms of distance, time, Maintenance, and Passenger care was assessed to be ZZZ2. A divert to ZZZ2 was conducted. Looking back, I probably should have gone ahead and [requested priority handling]. No special handling was required, but had the situation turned for the worse, it would have been good to have that. If I'm solving problems with the QRH, serious consideration should be given to [requesting priority handling]. Also, to prevent landing overweight at our nearest suitable airfield, we accomplished a turn back to final to be burn a few hundred pounds of gas to be within aircraft weight limits. Consideration should have been given to accepting the slight overweight landing and follow-on inspection, in order to expedite landing. At the time, I was thinking not to further complicate an already complex situation.		In cruise at FL390, I was the PF (Pilot Flying), Captain PM. The Master Caution started flickering on and off but too fast to actually see what it was. Over time we saw what the light was, so at XA:30 we ran the QRH for transfer bus off. We were in limits of running the APU so we turned it on and it extinguished so we thought it was the end of the procedure. We notified Dispatch that the QRH procedure had been performed and we needed fuel numbers for the running APU. Gave them current fuel on board. At XB:40 source Off light came on, same side, number one. We noticed the APU had fallen off line. We tried to start it again and for a few minutes it ran but at XC:43 fell off line again. We looked at the same procedure again for if the APU was not available and also being single electric source, we diverted to ZZZ2. Upon arrival into ZZZ2 we saw we were roughly 500 pounds heavy. On a right base, we did a right 360 turn to burn it off and we landed under weight in ZZZ2. We could have descended to a lower altitude and tried the APU a third time. Maybe next time I'll do that. We figured there could have been a bigger electric issue that was unknown. We didn't [request priority handling] and probably would next time to be safe in case we did end up losing the last good generator. Next time we could have landed overweight just to get on the ground but we didn't want to add another issue on top of the current problem.		Air carrier flight crew flying 737 aircraft reported electrical system malfunction inflight. Flight crew diverted and landed safely.

It was a normal takeoff until after the gear was retracted. A few hundred feet before thrust reduction/acceleration height we experienced 3 loud bangs and subsequent vibration from the left engine. I looked over to the upper display and saw the number 1 engine EGT was red. We both simultaneously said " number one engine failure". We then experienced three more bangs from the left engine. No ECAMs were present. I reduced the power on the left engine and the stall stopped. We [requested priority handling] with Tower and requested a runway heading track. We finished the climb and cleanup to 10,000 ft. and started to evaluate the problem. Since the stall stopped and the EGT was back to a normal temp we decided to leave the engine running at idle. We were vectored to Runway XXL and made an uneventful landing. ARFF investigated our left engine and said it seemed to be OK. It was a normal taxi to the gate and shutdown.

When we went around, the fuel was 5.8 - it should have been 6.3, but due to winds and vectoring and altitude restrictions, it was 5.8. Upon performing the go-around, we got the FUEL L WING TK LO LVL ECAM. I followed the checklist for that ECAM. I also noticed that the left wing tank was significantly lower than the right, around 1500. Then we got the FUEL L TK PUMP 1+2 LO PR ECAM, which I also followed the checklist for. We landed without any problems with about 4.0 on the fuel level. After parking, I called Dispatch and Maintenance Control and they said the fuel shouldn't have been that imbalanced and Maintenance Control instructed me to make a maintenance log book entry, so I did. He said there were no other issues though, and that I did everything correctly and Dispatch agreed.				A320 Captain reported executing a go-around after encountering wake turbulence on final approach from a preceding B777. During the go-around the flight crew experienced fuel imbalance anomalies.

I noted that the pitch control characteristics seemed abnormally stiff, despite being an older 700. ATC began vectoring us off the SID and giving us step climbs, so I elected to engage the autopilot to focus on the clearances and to monitor how the autopilot handled. Things seemed okay until shortly thereafter in the climb we encountered wake turbulence from an (other carrier aircraft). The autopilot was reacting slowly to lower the nose. I disengaged the autopilot to help fly it out of the wake and roll the wings level. Despite our higher speed, the pitch control seemed tighter than I would have expected as I flew us out of the wake. I commented this to the Captain at this point.With the autopilot re-engaged, we continued our climb and ATC then gave us normal speed. The autopilot had a hard time matching pitch to speed and began oscillating pitch attitudes, and then started to descend. I intervened. I then informed the Captain of how "heavy" the nose feels, and we elected to level off and evaluate. We considered the problem and if there was an appropriate QRH procedure. With each of those events, it was notable that the pitch controls felt different and very firm. Flying an approach in ZZZ1 with gusting winds was not an added risk factor we wanted to accept with an aircraft that needed this much extra pressure to make attitude changes. Additionally, we could not anticipate with certainty, what the autopilot would do or if the condition would not deteriorate further. We both agreed that what we were experiencing was something we were no longer comfortable continuing the flight with. We considered many options, ZZZ2 was nearby and had steady headwinds favoring the long Runway XX. We informed the Cabin Crew. The Captain became the PF. I notified ATC of our plan to initiate a slow descent to divert to ZZZ2. Advised ATC due to our flight control issue/concern and as an added Safety measure upon landing. While the Captain was flying, he confirmed how very stiff the pitch control axis was. We landed uneventfully.		The FO was flying the aircraft. During departure, he noticed the aircraft pitch axis seemed to be stiffer than normal. After engaging the autopilot, the autopilot did not do a good job of maintaining the pitch attitude. We encountered another aircraft wake, and after disengaging the autopilot, he noticed again the pitch axis was very stiff. He reengaged the autopilot, and the autopilot had a tough time changing speed while maintaining a consistent pitch attitude. When we finally leveled off, the First Officer (FO) expressed his concerns to me, and we began to discuss what to do about it.After discussing the problem, and some proposed solutions, we also reviewed the QRH even though there was no procedure for what we were experiencing. We finally decided since we didn't know exactly what was wrong, we could not predict whether or not it would get worse over time and based on that we decided to divert to ZZZ2 and advised ATC. We decided that I would fly the aircraft and the FO would be the Pilot Monitoring. We were very busy, and while I was flying the aircraft, I confirmed the pitch axis was very stiff. We planned for a long final, and slowed down slowly and early taking note of the changes in attitude. We landed uneventfully, and then taxied to the gate.		B737-700 flight crew reported abnormal flight control response in pitch during departure phase. They elected to divert to a nearby suitable airport.

Aircraft cabin altitude was climbing and descending with our actual altitude. We complied with the QRH, [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ. Approach and landing on [Runway] XXL at ZZZ was normal.		It was the first flight of the day, and Maintenance had just brought the aircraft to the gate. Myself, and a Flight Attendant were the first ones on the aircraft. I proceeded straight to the flight deck and began my originating flow. I powered up the aircraft and noticed that Captain had arrived. I then exited the flight deck and made my way to the ramp to perform my walk-around. The aircraft set up and departure planning took place as normal. Push-back and engine start took place normal. Once cleared for takeoff, we departed on the ZZZZZ Departure. Captain made a comment about the rate of climb. The aircraft was able to achieve. We made mention of how light the aircraft was with only XX Passengers on board. We climbed via the SID to 8,000 ft., then were given 14,000 ft. by ATC. Climbing out of 10,000 ft., we read the Climb Checklist and as we verified pressurization, the Captain made a double look, and notably appeared to notice something not right.Right about that time, the Cabin Altitude Warning light illuminated, and the horn sounded. Captain verified he had the controls and radios then instructed me to read the QRH. Captain stopped the climb at about 12,000 ft. and [requested priority handling] with ATC while requesting a lower altitude. We then proceeded with the QRH procedure without issue. ATC provided headings and altitudes as we planned for our arrival back to ZZZ without incident. Upon landing, coordinated a gate with Ground, Ops, and returned to park.When Maintenance came aboard to ask questions, I was unable to answer questions with absolute certainty concerning bleed positioning and pack usage. With better checklist verification on my part, I believe I would have been able to answer with more certainty.		B737-700 flight crew reported receiving a cabin altitude warning horn and light during climb out at 12,000 feet.

ATC then began giving us step downs and speed assignments as they were putting a heavy abeam us on Runway XXL. We ended up high and LVL CHG was selected to get back to our path. We descended just below 1200 ft. just outside ZZZZZ. We were correcting back when Tower advised Low Altitude Alert. Cause: I was looking outside and concerned about our closeness to the heavy and the possibility of a low level wake turbulence event. Suggestion: Not spacing us that close to arriving aircraft. Had we been able to fly the full Visual Approach we would not have gotten out of VNAV PATH. The speed changes and altitude clearances along the way helped to get us out of VNAV PATH. Being that close to the heavy jet on Runway XXL also added to our workload with a concern for possible go around or wake turbulence encounter.		VMC, descending on Visual Approach prior to reaching waypoint ZZZZZ airplane descended below 1200 ft. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) called out altitude and I began a recovery back to 1200 ft. Tower called Altitude Alert and I continued back to 1200 ft. I continued the Visual Approach and landing without further incidence. Cause: Casual factors include unfamiliar Visual Approach at night. Simultaneously flying parallel to a heavy jet. Focus was on spacing from heavy jet. Multiple airspeed calls and altitude calls from tower. Suggestion: Recommend ATC assign ILS due to night conditions and close parallel runways with heavy aircraft on final.		An air carrier flight crew reported they flew below the lowest charted altitude of the charted visual approach and received a Low Altitude Alert from the Tower.

On takeoff rotation felt/heard a bang/bump. Takeoff continued. Landing Gear/Flaps retracted per normal takeoff profile. Followed LNAV PATH to clear terrain and leveled off at 17,000 ft. Initial idea between FO and Captain was a blown main gear tire. The was a slight increase in engine noise and vibration on climbout, but no abnormal engine indications. When power retarded at level off engine noise/vibration returned to normal. Immediately following rotation there was an abnormal smell in the cockpit/cabin for two to three minutes that cleared after that time. We immediately notified Tower of our expected blown tire and requested a runway inspection to confirm our suspicion. Flight Attendants called the flight deck and described the smell/noise/vibration described above. While waiting for runway inspection findings we held over the ZZZ VOR at 15,000 ft. I requested the Flight Attendants to attempt to view the flap area to do a damage assessment. They reported back that multiple Passengers witnessed multiple bird strikes.We talked to Dispatch through Company communications to coordinate a diversion to our departure point of ZZZ. Departure Control got back to us and reported 10 dead birds were discovered on/near the runway near our estimated rotation point. No aircraft tire remnants were discovered, and we determined the event was indeed a bird strike. We [requested priority handling] and requested Crash/Fire Rescue to meet the aircraft at our intended runway turn-off (High Speed Taxiway 1). We received vectors for the ILS to Runway XX at ZZZ and landed without incident. Crash/Fire Rescue met the aircraft and on Ground Control frequency we requested an inspection of the aircraft with emphasis on smoke/fire/leakage of flammable liquids etc. They discovered no such issues and we taxied under our own power to Gate XX at ZZZ. Post flight exterior inspection revealed multiple bird strikes on the left wing leading edge and #1 Engine. Multiple bent fan blades on the #1 Engine were observed. Logbook writeup was completed by the Captain. Passengers and Flight Attendants were kept aware of our progress throughout the event.Suggestions: No birds were observed prior to the bird strike. Lighting conditions were dark dusk/almost night. During the event we discussed what non-normal checklists we should/could reference. No abnormal engine indications were observed throughout the event. While debriefing the event with the First Officer we reference the Engine Limit or Surge or Stall QRH Checklist and discovered the bullet point: Abnormal engine noises are heard, possibly with airframe vibration. In retrospect, this QRH checklist should have been referenced. Further, out of an abundance of caution we could have run the One Engine Inoperative Landing QRH Checklist. This could have been appropriate even though both engines continued to operate to prepare us in the event of an engine shutdown/malfunction prior to landing.		During rotation on Runway XXL at ZZZ the aircraft experienced a slight thud and slight settling on what I perceived at the time to be on the left side of the aircraft. Since I was flying the aircraft, I verbalized this to the Captain, and he verified the sound. The aircraft was flying normally, and both engine instruments appeared to be normal. We both initially thought it was a tire issue. The aircraft flew normally, and normal checklists were flown through 10,000 ft. To me, it seemed that one or both of the engines were very slightly louder than normal. But no air frame vibration was noted, and the engine instruments were normal.  I brought this up to the Captain and he said he could not hear it at the time. Most likely because the sound was extremely slight. At this time the Flight Attendants called us, and they said they could smell something and some of the passengers may have seen some birds on takeoff. The smell dissipated quickly. We discussed this complex issue and the Captain decided to enter holding and coordinate with the Tower to have a runway sweep conducted and he then coordinate with Dispatch. We were told that approximately eight quail were found on the runway. The Captain elected to return to ZZZ. The Captain flew the landing and following landing rollout, the Fire Chief inspected the aircraft and did not notate any damage. We taxied back to the gate.Suggestions: Upon post flight debrief, we discussed the incident and determined we possibly should have run the Engine Limit, or Surge or Stall QRH Checklist. Based on one of the condition notes for abnormal engine noises		B737-700 flight crew reported a bird strike event during takeoff resulting in left wing leading edge and fan blade damage. The flight crew returned to the departure airport and landed.

About 2,200 ft., felt a thump, bang and slight roll to the left. Thought we hit a bird. I was still flying aircraft by hand, powered up #2 Engine and continued climb to 3,000 ft. and leveled off. Looked at engine instruments, #1 Engine rolled back and displayed ENG FAIL light. No fire, no vibration, no seizure, and we had N1. [Requested priority handling], completed Engine Failure Checklist and Single Engine Landing Checklist. ACARSed Dispatch, briefed Flight Attendants and the Passengers. ATC vectored us around for ILS XXR approach. Stopped on runway, emergency crews met aircraft and inspected engine. Taxied off runway and sat for 70 minutes to cool brakes. Uneventful taxi to gate. Coordinated engine failure, overweight landing, and brake cooling with Station Operations, Dispatch, Maintenance Control, Chief Pilot, and Dispatch management.		B737-800 flight crew reported the number 1 engine failed during takeoff resulting in an immediate return to the departure airport.

As we monitored ZZZZ Tower frequency, the Tower Controller cleared a Piper Navajo to takeoff Runway XX at intersection 1. After his read back, ZZZZ Tower Controller issued us line up and wait, Runway XX. The FO read back the line up and wait verbatim. I set the aircraft lighting according, cleared left and noted the Piper twin was on his takeoff roll away from us, I cleared the right side along with noting traffic what looked like on a left base to the Runway XY. The FO cleared right and left also. The Tower Controller did not say anything to us concerning traffic on final or on approach to our runway, and I believed the aircraft was on base for Runway XY. As I saw the Challenger in a steep left turn to line up on our Runway XX, I was slowing the aircraft's roll down simultaneously as the Controller issued "Company Flight XXXX, cancel line up and wait, Stop!" I immediately stopped the aircraft. Our aircraft was about halfway past the hold short line. The traffic (CL60, Challenger 604) that was on base is now in a high bank turn to intercept final for our runway XX, the Tower Controller issued the aircraft to make S-turns as needed. The FO stated to the Tower Controller we are "well" past the hold short line. We at this point expected the Tower Controller to issue a go around for the traffic, no response or direction from the Controller, besides "S-turns approved."  As the Challenger rolled out of his S-turn, he saw the situation and self-initiated a go around. The Challenger went around about 200 ft. on final for runway XX. The tower controller then issued the Challenger go around instructions to fly. At this point, I had the FO ask the Tower Controller if we need to vacate the runway or line up and wait as we were past the hold short line. The FO, asked verbatim and the Tower Controller issued us, "line up and wait Runway XX, (other carrier) traffic 7 mile final Runway XY." We lined up and waited. About 30 seconds later she issued us a takeoff clearance, "Company Flight XXXX, traffic landing Runway XY will hold short of your runway at 2, fly runway heading, cleared for takeoff Runway XX." I read back the takeoff clearance as the FO started the takeoff. Also, as we were rolling, the Tower Controller again verified with the traffic landing Runway XY, that he was going to hold short of [taxiway] 2. Normal takeoff continued with an uneventful flight to ZZZ. At no time did we cross the runway hold short line without an ATC clearance. At no time was our aircraft on the runway itself between the white sideline stripes on the runway. Our aircraft was approximately halfway across the hold short line, with an estimated distance of about 200 ft. from the runway side stripe. At no time, in my opinion, was our aircraft or Passengers in danger with the Challenger using normal approach and landing maneuvers, or loss of normal separation. As we were stopped halfway across the hold short line and the Challenger was over the centerline of the runway. In my opinion based on the Controller's actions, (lack of responsive communication and situational awareness to correct the potential conflict) she was caught off guard as the Challenger turned final for our Runway XX. We never did hear the Challenger check on with Tower or receive a landing clearance as this may have been completed prior to us monitoring Tower frequency. The Tower Controller could have issued the Challenger go around instructions. The Tower Controller should have issued us a traffic advisory of the Challenger as she issued us the initial line up and wait clearance. We should have spoken up earlier, instead of remaining silent for a few seconds to not potentially block the Tower's communications to the Challenger. We both expected the Tower Controller to issue a go around for the Challenger instead of "S-turns approved."		Holding short of Runway XX on Taxiway 3, we received our lineup and wait clearance from Tower. This clearance included information on an aircraft which had been cleared for XX with a LASHO of [taxiway] 2 intersection. There was a GA aircraft just previously cleared for takeoff at intersection 1. The Captain and I noted the traffic on takeoff and looked for traffic on approach to our runway. I did not see any traffic, but the Captain noted traffic on what appeared to be a left base leg for Runway XY. As we were positioning our aircraft for takeoff on the runway, the Controller cancelled our line up and wait clearance. The aircraft which had appeared to be on approach to XY had turned towards XX. This communication came too late as we were past the hold short line for XX. I communicated with the Tower we were "well past" the hold short line, about half the aircraft length, and unable to comply with her clearance. She issued the aircraft, a Challenger 604, now on final an "S Turns ok" clearance which seemed odd as we were at this point expecting her to issue this aircraft a go around clearance. Not wanting to potentially block a go around clearance or call by either Tower or the aircraft on final, we waited as long as possible to potentially interject with our concerns. About half a mile out the Challenger reported a go around.Based on the Challenger's high approach profile and its track we later observed on an app, as well as what seemed to be a higher than normal bank angle to get lined up with Runway XX, we believe this aircraft may have confused Runway XX for XY and lined up on the wrong runway.		Air carrier flight crew reported after they were issued line up and wait clearance they stopped past the hold short line when they observed a landing aircraft on short final.

We started the day with an uneventful taxi out, take off, and cruise. Prior to the start of the flight both hydraulic systems showed somewhere between 95-100% volume. Shortly before the Top of Descent the 'A' system engine driven hydraulic pump illuminated the 'LOW PSI' light. Looking at the lower we noted that there was no abnormal hydraulic pressure, but a slightly lower volume of fluid than in the 'B' system. We ran the QRH Checklist for the LOW PSI light which directed us to turn off the engine driven hydraulic pump and continued our descent. Shortly thereafter the 'A' hydraulic fluid volume began to decrease but seemed to steady out in the 26-28% range while showing pressure in the normal range. Further along in the descent, the 'A' volume dropped to 8% then 0% indicated. There was no increased demand on the hydraulic system that may have caused the fluid level to display a lower than actual volume.At this point we elected to treat this as an 'A' system failure and ran the associated checklist. While doing that, the 'B' hydraulic engine driven pump LOW PSI light illuminated while indicating normal volume and pressure. We ran the QRH for that system as well. After completing both checklists down to the deferred items, we had only one of the main four hydraulic pumps still selected on and the 'A' system standby pump on. For these reasons we [requested assistance] with ZZZ Approach and request the longer runway for landing. The Flight Attendants were briefed on the situation, then the passengers were also briefed via PA. Dispatch was kept in the loop via ACARS. Following the Deferred Items Checklist, we landed normally and under maximum landing weight (109.4). The brake cooling ACARS report said we were clear to taxi to the gate with no cooling delays necessary. The taxi in was uneventful. After shutdown there was fresh hydraulic fluid in the #1 main landing gear bay, and a fresh puddle of fluid under the #1 engine.The checklist was a bit ambiguous in the decision making process of is it/isn't it a system 'A' failure when one hydraulic pump light is on, but the other wasn't - even though volume dropped to 0.				B737-800 Captain reported loss of A hydraulic system fluid, as well as the loss of one of the two B system pumps. The flight crew requested assistance from ATC and a normal landing ensued.

As I was running the QRH Checklists for the engine failure, I read out loud the section about getting landing data. At the time the Captain had the aircraft well under control and said he would get the landing data for the engine out landing. When we received the landing data, I noticed the landing speeds seemed to be slightly off based on what the FMC was showing for ZZZZ. I questioned this with the Captain and he said he felt comfortable with the data. During the approach the Captain ended up flying a final approach speed slightly higher than the speeds in the landing data. Subsequently, after shutting down, the Captain brought it to my attention that the landing data had come back with data for Runway XXR in ZZZ1.I should have been more attentive with what the data showed including what airport it was for. I knew something didn't look correct but with all the stuff that was going on, I let the error get past me.		Engine failure and shutdown at 15,000 ft. climbing out of ZZZ. Returned to ZZZ for single engine landing. We were distracted with checklists ATC and maneuvering the aircraft. I ran numbers for landing data, and we set the speeds for landing. The speeds seemed low, so I flew five knots faster than reference speed. After landing I noticed I had inadvertently used ZZZ1 as the landing airport because we didn't change the destination in the FMC. ZZZ1 and ZZZ both have a Runway XXR, so we didn't get an error message.		Air carrier flight crew reported engine failure on climb out. During return to departure airport the flight crew inadvertently used landing data from a different airport that resulted in incorrect FMC display.  Flight crew landed safely.

Hydraulic quantity left low and associated pumps low pressure. We continued to climb on the departure. I switch control of the aircraft to the FO and then we ran the associated checklists. we contacted dispatch. Initially, dispatch told us to head to ZZZ1 about 15 minutes later they contacted us and said that the runway was wet in ZZZ1 and to proceed back to ZZZ. We [requested priority handling]. We dumped fuel to get down to landing wait. The fuel dump took 20 minutes. It was started at XA33 Zulu and finished at XA53 Zulu ATC advised us when to start the dump so we won't be over a populated area. During all this vectoring, the First Officer was the flying pilot and he had to hand fly because the autopilot was inoperable . VNAV stopped working when we reached cruise altitude. ATC gave us a 10 mile final to the ILS XX ZZZ. We landed with no issues, and proceeded to gate X.		On climbout we got the HYD PRESS SYS L EICAS alert as well as other associated EICAS alerts. We continued the climb out and I accomplished the HYD PRESS SYS L non normal checklist. We confirmed zero hydraulic fluid quantity on the status page. The Captain transferred control of the aircraft to me with the autopilot engaged and we continued our departure while the Captain contacted dispatch. Dispatch recommended that we go to ZZZ1. We [requested priority handling] and around this time VNAV failed and the autopilot failed. I hand flew the rest of the flight. The Captain spoke to the flight attendants and passengers alerting them of our situation and that we would be diverting to ZZZ1. Dispatch eventually called us back and recommended that we return to ZZZ. We contacted ATC and asked to return to ZZZ and for a place to dump fuel as we were well over landing weight.  We were vectored to a safe location and altitude and proceeded to dump fuel.  The fuel dumping process took approximately 25 to 30 minutes. The Captain spoke to the flight attendants and the passengers again alerting them that we would now be returning to ZZZ. We elected to use Runway XX as the longest option available in ZZZ. We asked for a 10 mile final and shot the ILS to a normal landing.		B777 flight crew reported hydraulic pump failure and autopilot failure just after takeoff and a return to their departure airport.

By following the QRH we turned off the center pumps. We immediately saw a rapid decrease in the #1 tank and further imbalance, and per the QRH determined the presence of a fuel leak. We reviewed our options, weather, spoke with Dispatch and ATC and began a diversion to ZZZ, which was roughly 100 miles to our north. The QRH instructed us to shut down the #1 Engine. Due to the circumstances, we felt it was unnecessary. In the interest of safety, we left the engine running. We notified FA's (Flight Attendants) and passengers, completed all remaining checklists and landed safely at ZZZ.

During configuration for landing at ZZZ1 - FO (First Officer) was pilot flying - we noticed the speed tapes on the MFD's (Multi-Function Flight Display) were showing abnormal indications. With landing gear down, flaps 25, and engine anti-ice on the flaps 25, speed bug was in the yellow band and flaps 40 VREF was in the red band. Unsure of our situation we elected to accomplish a go-around and requested vectors for a holding pattern to evaluate. I quickly talked to the flight attendants and informed them we had an anomaly we were trying to figure out. The flight attendants made a quick PA to inform the passengers. We resubmitted our performance data, landing data, and made sure everything was submitted correctly, including landing weight and engine anti-ice. The landing data that came back looked right and the speeds matched the FMC speeds at that time. Our gas was at 5.6 and we decided we needed a longer runway for a flaps 15 approach, since flaps 40 VREF was in the red band earlier. We elected to divert to ZZZ. I quickly informed Dispatch and the flight attendants. Flight attendants informed the passengers. We were vectored for a flaps 15 approach to Runway XXC at ZZZ. We resubmitted our performance data landing data and noticed that performance data flaps 15 speed was 146 while FMC generated speed was 135. We obviously elected to go with the faster speed. I took the aircraft for landing. Once configured for a flaps 15 landing our flaps 15 VREF speed of 146 was two kt. above the yellow band and 17 kt. above the red band. I elected to fly a couple kt. faster so as not to land with the speed in the yellow band. We touched down about five kt. above the yellow band. We landed uneventfully and taxied to Gate XX. The FO made a nice face-to-face PA with the passengers summarizing what happened while I initiated a call with Dispatch. We had a 5-way conversion with Dispatch, Chief Pilot, Maintenance, and some sort of Regional Manager. I wrote up the anomaly with coordination with Maintenance and Contract Maintenance arrived at the aircraft and starting coordinating with our Maintenance. All passengers and crew exited and went through Customs.Since no assistance was needed upon landing at ZZZ and at the time our landing fuel was above 4.0, we elected to not declare an emergency. Upon hindsight and reevaluating our stressful situation, I think declaring an emergency might have been a better decision.[Suggestions are] unknown since we really don't know what happened with our airspeed display. We just tried to take the safest course of action to land the aircraft given we didn't have enough fuel to try another attempt.				B737-700 Captain reported abnormal airspeed indications on the MFD speed tape display. Flight crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

However, just below the overheat level. We monitored the situation for a few moments and determined there was clearly an issue and we chose to accomplish the initial ECAM that was presented to us. We also turned on the APU. After doing so and due to the poor weather situation at our destination combined with our current proximity to ZZZ, we elected that the safest option was to divert ZZZ. The remainder of the flight went smoothly.				A320 First Officer reported the IDG oil temperature was spiking during cruise and received an ECAM memo for an overheat indication.

Discussed this with dispatch to see if they had another aircraft. None available. Ran land app and it showed if less than braking action 5, we could not land in ZZZ.  Told them if braking action was less than good in ZZZ, I would go to my alternate. Level FL 370- Eng 2 hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. Followed QRH & shut off eng driven 2 B pump.  Within a short time, we got an ELEC 1 Low B pressure light and Flt Cntrl B Low Pressure light with ZERO B qty. Completed QRH for loss of B system. We were in an area with very large weather system that gave us NO " nearest suitable" divert runways (all less than cat 1 with gusty winds). Called dispatch and discussed divert/ runway options. We both agreed going to ZZZ1 was best weather option/ divert option. Subsequently got Eng 1 low pressure light (A side).  I knew the PTU kicks in with B fluid doing the work but did not expect ENG 1 A low pressure light. Had good  A side % and pressure, so chose not to shut off that pump (as one might do as QRH checklist has for low pressure light) and risk total A & B hydraulic failure. After 10 mins, Eng 1 low pressure light went out and qty slowly decreased to 80% with good pressure.Landed ZZZ1 using stby hyd to lower flaps/ slats. ARFF checked for leaks and followed us back to gate after giving all safe.Jet had numerous previous reverser write-ups  that could have been hydraulic b problems in hindsight.Recommendations: There needs to be a NOTE in the LOSS OF SYSTEM  B  procedure in the QRH that says if you loose complete B HYDRAULICS, the A side uses its fluid to balance out the system and you will get an A side low pressure light that comes on for 5-10 mins. Otherwise in similar situation, crews will shut off perfectly good pump on A side.		Started with low pressure light on engine driven pump on B side.  Per checklist, turned the pump off.  Later, electric driven pump low pressure light also illuminated on the B side and quantity indicated 0%.  Went to checklist for loss of system B which required, among other things, a flaps 15 landing.  We were unable to land ZZZ due to required landing distance and opted for ZZZ1. Some time later, engine driven pump A low pressure light illuminated.   CA [advised ATC], requested clearance direct ZZZ1, worked with dispatch and informed FA and passengers while I flew the aircraft.  When he was ready, he took the aircraft back to fly.  Landing was uneventful.  We taxied off the runway and ARFF met us.  They informed us that we had a mild to moderate puddle forming at our right engine.  They followed us to the gate.

With landing gear down, Flaps 25 and engine anti-ice on, the Flaps 15 Speed bug was in the Yellow band and the Flaps 40 vREF was in the red band/stick shaker. We elected to go around at 1,000 ft. and requested vectors while we evaluating the situation. We resubmitted our performance data (including obtaining new weather). The landing data that came back looked correct, and was the same as the original data obtained. Unsure if we would encounter the same anomalies with the speed tapes again, and fuel at 5.6, we opted to divert to ZZZ1 for the longer runways. We chose to land Flaps 15 in order to keep the speeds above the red band. When we obtained performance data Flaps 15 for XYC at ZZZ1, the performance data generated speed was 146, while the FMC generated speed was 135. We chose the faster speed for landing. Once fully configured for Flaps 15 landing, the Flaps 15 vREF Speed was two knots above the yellow band and 17 knots above the red band. Captain became Pilot Flying for the landing and we elected to increase the speed slightly more to not land in the yellow band. We landed uneventfully and taxied to the gate.				B737 First Officer reported failure to request expeditious handling with abnormal speed indications resulted in a deviation.

They had fought the fire with a Halon and H2O extinguisher. Source of fire could not be determined but was suppressed and will continue to monitor. We conferenced called with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and determined that landing at nearest suitable would be safest course of action not knowing source of fire. Shortly after making this decision the Relief Pilot on break found a cell phone under the seat that had ruptured in the seat track and was the cause of the fire. The phone was secured in the thermo containment bag as per the Flight Attendant Manual. After being notified we were confident in the location and containment of the fire and we continued with our flight plan to ZZZZ.		We received a cabin call that the Captain answered.   He informed me that seat XX was on fire and smoking.  The Flight Attendants fought the fire and told us they believed it was out.  We discussed making a 180 and heading towards ZZZZ1 [Airport] and then the Captain called Dispatch.  At this moment, ZZZZ Center gave me a frequency for ZZZZ Radio for our HF freqs and Selcal check. I asked ZZZZ Center if we could stay with him on his freq since we had an issue in the back.  I was flying and talking to ATC as the Cap (Captain) talked to Dispatch.  Since we did not know the origin of the fire at this time, the Captain, Dispatch and I agreed to head towards ZZZZ1.  The Captain called the Flight Attendant to let them know what was happening and where we were going.  I advised ATC with ZZZZ Center and asked for routing back to ZZZZ1. They gave me a turn direct and headed there.   After we made the turn and headed towards ZZZZ1, I plugged all the pertinent info into the FMC, pulled up RWY data and ATIS.  As I was doing this, the Captain finished his called with the FA (Flight Attendant) and also told them to get the Relief Pilot up here since he just finished his break.  When the Captain got off the phone, we started going through the diversion guide, along with the WX (Weather) at ZZZZ1.  As this was going on, the phone rang and it was the Relief Pilot.  He had found the source of the fire.  It was a cell phone that underneath the seat.  After we found this out and brought dispatch back on the line, we all agreed that since we found the source of the fire and had enough gas, to press on back to ZZZZ.  I informed ATC of our intentions and got another clearance back to coordinates.  We asked for another oceanic clearance and off we went.		B777 flight crew reported a Flight Attendant informed the flight deck crew of a fire in the cabin which was extinguished. Shortly thereafter the Relief Pilot found a crushed cell phone where the fire was extinguished and with this information the flight continued to its destination safely.

ECAM directed throttle to idle and shutdown engine if pressure below 10 psi. Oil pressure was indicating normal on the gauge and on the digital display so we didn't shutdown engine. I referenced the QRH which indicated that we could disregard the ECAM if the pressure indications were normal. Meanwhile we had leveled off and told ATC of our issue. PF (Pilot Flying) brought the power back up and we elected to continue climb. We told our company operations control of our issue and that we were currently continuing on. Then I noticed that our oil quantity was decreasing. I told our company ops control about the declining quantity and they passed it on to maintenance. We leveled off at FL310 and the PF brought the power back on eng 1 to see if the oil loss would subside. Meanwhile, our maintenance told us they'd prefer a return back to ZZZ and we concurred as it was closer anyway. We coordinated a return to ZZZ. I told ATC that we were losing eng oil quantity but that everything was running normally but to be aware we might declare an emergency if our oil pressure dropped. Fortunately, it was dropping slow enough that we had time to make it back to ZZZ without incident. We started the day with 20 quarts of oil and after engine shutdown in the blocks we had 8 quarts.

We joined [taxiways] 1, 2, 3, held short 4 for runway XXC. Approaching 4 on 3 I advised tower we were ready for departure. Shortly thereafter, we were given line up and wait XXC instruction. I advised tower we were unable as a company aircraft was now [on taxiway] 4 and holding short XXC. Tower cleared the aircraft for departure and for us to line up and wait XXC. Shortly after lining up on XXC we received a takeoff clearance, no delay, company aircraft 2 mile final. The captain started to spool the IAE engines, and again the tower controllers tone of urgency for us to depart became more apparent. I came across the radio and told him it takes time for the IAE's to spool. What felt simultaneous, was us departing the runway and tower issuing the company aircraft on final a go around. Tower told the go around aircraft to maintain visual separation, which would shortly become impossible as we were IMC shortly thereafter. There was more exchange between the go around aircraft and the tower controller that I cannot remember. At around 1300 ft. AGL, I heard tower issue Aircraft X (my flight) to fly a 160 heading. Because the Captain was hand flying the aircraft, I pulled the heading bug and selection a 160 heading and replied to the ATC instruction. At about 2800 ft. MSL we heard an instruction to climb to 3000 ft. Thus, I dialed in 3000 ft.; at this point, the autopilot was now engaged and the aircraft was successfully capturing 3000 ft. MSL. Upon replying to the 3000 ft. call, the controller said that we should be flying the RNAV sit and EXPEDITING though 3000.  At this point, I was starting to at best feel a bit behind the aircraft due to the high workload demand and lack of clarity in the instructions. In order to let the controller know what we were doing as we believed to be correct, I replied with 'ok, we were instructed to fly a 160 heading and maintain 3000 ft., (those two instructions were not concurrent) I also said I'm sure you meant to give the go around aircraft the 160 heading, but you gave it to us, but we are now rejoining and climbing via the ZZZZZ SID. The controller asked, sarcastically, if we were done - I didn't reply. The tower controller then instructed us to contact departure. We continued with no further incident.Overall, there was a communication breakdown between the tower controller and the go around aircraft and the tower controller and myself. Lack of standard phraseology.We need to have more clarity in instructions during periods of high workload. I should have asked the controller to verify the heading instruction, which the controller would have either confirmed or denied, which would have given the controller better opportunity to handle the one go around aircraft instead of two aircraft on similar headings.		After being cleared for takeoff on XXC, tower told us to expedite, since traffic was stated to be on a two mile final.    I wasted no time applying power, but we do have to pause momentarily to let EPR stabilize before we can apply takeoff power.     Once we approached around 120 knots speed on takeoff roll, tower instructed aircraft behind us to go around.    He asked if traffic behind us could keep us in visual contact.   They replied that they could not. Tower gave us a heading of 160, and we turned to that heading.    He then gave the go around traffic 140 heading.    Tower then said something we interpreted as "Aircraft X, climb to 3000."  We were passing 2300 at that point.      Our departure procedure altitude was 10,000, so I figured since we were already off the departure, and flying the new altitude, tower meant to level us at 3000.     My FO quickly set 3000, and I began leveling.     Tower told us to "hurry through 3000."    It could be that we misinterpreted the original instruction, because he did not use standard phraseology.   "Expedite" would have made the 3000 altitude instruction unmistakable.  We didn't actually level at 3000, only started to.   When the controller mentioned 3000 a second time, it was clear that he wanted us to pass through that altitude quickly-at which point, we set 10,000 quickly, I selected open climb, and we got past the altitude very quickly.   Our energy state was still high, and climb was rapid.    During this event, multiple instructions were given to both our flight and the flight on the go around, multiple altitudes and headings.   I heard that other aircraft assigned 140 heading at some point as well.    It was unclear to me what the controller's intent was with the headings, but we complied with ours.    He then directed us to fly direct to a fix and rejoin the SID.   From that point, we continued the flight normally.     We never heard any TCAS TA or RA, so I am not sure how close the aircraft got.    From our perspective, it was a very rapid fire set of instructions to both aircraft, and we complied with all of them to the best of our knowledge.I think the root issue here is the way some controllers use assumed separation.    I know they are under pressure to maximize runway utilization, but I think they should be much more conservative with assumed separation.    We didn't dilly on our takeoff roll a bit.   On these older engines, the spool up time can be much longer.    On old IAEs, sometimes the time to set takeoff thrust can be 3x or more the time for CFMs [engines].    Controllers need to create more space so these situations can't occur.     The big issue that made this event so difficult was the barrage of verbal instructions to both aircraft.    Some were unclear, and even with an experienced crew, prompt and correct compliance can was difficult.    Tower instructions need to be paced clearly, annunciated clearly, and carefully planned in order to ensure proper compliance with intent.   Two flight crews did our best to comply with the instructions and avoid a dangerous situation, but we both had trouble interpreting very rapid and sometimes unclear instructions.     Succinct, standard phraseology would have prevented much confusion.   Had I understood that a plane was landing so close behind our takeoff, I would never would have accepted the takeoff clearance.    Perhaps due to some slight visual illusion, I was certain the landing lights I saw were lined up with XXL.		A320 flight crew reported during initial climb ATC issued confusing instructions using non-standard phraseology which contributed to a heading deviation. Flight crew stated the aircraft landing right behind them was directed by ATC to go-around due to lack of aircraft separation and both aircraft were being vectored to regain separation.

They were essentially vectoring holding and then putting aircraft in line for approach. Our initial vectors to final were close enough to the aircraft in front of us that we inadvertently flew through wake turbulence, increasing our pitch and dropping our airspeed by 10-15 knots rapidly. Airspeed loss was not outside range of current configuration, but slower than ATC directed. This occurred at 8 mile final. I disengaged autopilot and hand flew approach from approximately 3000 AGL. Soon after, Tower directed us to slow to slowest practical and maintain. We slowed from originally directed 180 to 154. At 5 mile final we were cleared to land. At approximately 3.5 mile final for 28R SFO, Tower cleared an aircraft for takeoff on 1R. We were in VMC conditions so we continued the approach looking for line of sight and impending rotation of departing aircraft. At approximately 400 ft AGL my First Officer saw beginning of crossing runway takeoff aircraft rotation. Just before the PM approaching minimums call, we heard our call sign go-around from Tower. We executed go-around per FM and were given subsequent radar vectors for same runway, landing uneventfully.		ATC directed go around at 500 AGL on visual approach to Runway 36R. We were vectored back for another visual approach on Runway 36R. We landed the flight safely without further incident.		B737NG flight crew reported executing a go-around from a low altitude after spacing issues became apparent. Earlier in the flight they encountered wake turbulence that resulted in airspeed loss of 10-15 knots.

The Pilot Monitoring (PM) asked the Pilot Flying (PF) if he wanted the FAF altitude of 8,100 ft. in the Mode Control Panel altitude window and set it for him. The PM neglected to check that the aircraft was in the VNAV mode before setting the altitude, (the aircraft was descending at 1000 FPM in VSPEED mode). There was a slight distraction about which approach to shoot and as the Crew consulted approach plates and discussed if an ILS or RNAV would be preferred, both Crew failed to notice the aircraft descending below the step down altitude of 9900 ft. at ZZZZZ1 and 12,000 ft. outside ZZZZZ. Being in VNAV mode would have prevented the error. As we turned our attention back to the approach we were flying we noticed our altitude deviation and leveled off. No secondary warnings of Low Altitude were activated, (TCAS etc.) during the entire event and recovery we had the mountainous terrain below and along the approach path in sight, and ATC never called out our altitude deviation. We remained in level flight until back on the approach profile and continued the approach without incident.Suggestions: Better automation management, especially in regards to any descent using VNAV through intermediate step altitudes, needs be accomplished. Also, perhaps the PM should not offer to change Mode Control Panel parameters so readily when the PF is still orientating to a new clearance.				Air carrier pilot reported during descent they failed to notice the aircraft descended below a step down altitude. Flight crew recovered from altitude deviation and continued approach.

About 2 hours later as we descended into ZZZZ, the same EICAS message populated. We reran the checklist and this time the message would not extinguished, so the emergency checklist commanded us to shut down the left engine. We did so and [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ approach. ATC gave us direct IAF of the ILS XXL approach. The rest of the flight continued safely to a landing.

I elected to reject the takeoff. Reject was initiated at about 80 KIAS. Below 85 KIAS as the rejected takeoff (RTO) did NOT engage. Tower was advised of the reject. The First Officer (FO) made a PA to "remain seated". We exited the runway I checked the doors page and the gear page and accomplished the related checklists and elected to return to the gate. Upon inspection Maintenance discovered that a large ADP bleed line (~5" in diameter) had ruptured in the wheel well with a section approximately 14" long mostly gone. Further investigation revealed that the rupture had sent shrapnel all over within the wheel well and the aircraft was removed from service to survey any secondary damage that may have occurred from the shrapnel. Passengers seated in the area reported hearing the bang. We heard nothing in the cockpit. During our debriefing we reviewed the low speed abort criteria and noted that a bleed loss body was not on the list specifically, but more generally under "system failure." Given the Mechanics description of the shrapnel we were left wondering what secondary failures might have been caused by the shrapnel, if any, had we taken the flight airborne. We were not sure what wires and lines run through the area. We did check the air synoptic and noted that the system had performed the automatic isolation as would be expected, thus after the rupture, bleed air was likely not being injected into the area. Perhaps the risk of secondary damage has been assessed, but not being aware of that, at this point I think that perhaps it should be considered to add bleed loss body to the low speed abort item list. As an aside, For XX+ years of my piloting career I have been trained to call out "abort." Being aware of that, since we changed to "reject," I have briefed that "in the heat of the moment, I am not sure if I will call out reject or abort." It was a valuable briefing, as I called out "Abort." It was hard to unlearn decades of training. I knew as soon as I said it that it was the wrong call out, but my FO know what my decision was and performed perfectly. Also, knowing that the Reject checklist primarily focuses on engine failure/fire, after clearing the runway I called for the bleed loss checklist that was displayed as I was concerned about having hot bleed air ducting into areas it should not and the potential for a fire or related damage. Though we accomplished all of the items on the reject checklist, we realized during our debrief that we had failed to actually run the reject checklist. All of our training for rejects is either to not reject, or for an engine failure/fire. This did not fit into those 2 training events, and yet there were other considerations, hot bleed air leak, secondary damage. As we focused on assessing the potential impact of hot bleed air we forgot to actually run the reject checklist. As this was a low speed reject, without RTO (not as violent as we train in the sim) and an anomaly I have never had, either in the sim or on the line, we were out of the normal sequence where we have been trained to run the reject checklist. When we debriefed this, we reviewed the reject checklist and had in fact accomplished everything on it. I would suggest that training incorporate something like this event for reject training.I had never considered the potential for an explosive bleed line rupture that could cause secondary damage. Though the Maintenance Team did not know the extent of any secondary damage resulting from the shrapnel the potential further reinforced the correctness of my decision to reject the takeoff.				B777 flight crew received a 'Bleed Loss Body' EICAS message on take-off roll. Flight crew performed a rejected takeoff and returned to the gate.

I had noticed in the windscreen an aircraft ahead of us putting out contrails that were curling into perfectly symmetrical swirls but didn't think much about it. I had assumed it was 1,000 ft. or so above or below and was coming against us, but I believe now it was co-altitude company traffic going the same direction. We had a new hire pilot on the jump seat doing an observation ride and were talking flying/Company stuff which probably distracted me from possible hazard ahead. Fairly suddenly, the aircraft rolled 30 degrees to the left, and then started back rolling to the right. I immediately recognized it as wake turbulence and hit the altitude intervention button to start a descent to get out from it. The 1970's 286 processor took too long for me to start the descent, so I punched off the autopilot and started the descent manually. Once the electronics caught up, I reconnected the autopilot, probably within 500 ft. of descent. I asked my FO (First Officer) to report it to ATC whose reaction was utter disbelief by his tone and words used. That's when I learned it was Company ahead of us. I don't know if it was a larger version of the 737 or not. I did notice we had about 116 knots of tailwind directly at our 6:00 position probably exacerbating the setup (or at least not alleviating it). My FO looked up if it was a reportable incident or not, and the manual just stated ATC was all that was required. Our Flight Attendants (and therefore our customers as well) definitely noticed it, because they mentioned it on the ground. I decided to write this report to have as a data point, and because ATC was so utterly surprised and really non-believing that these things happen (and happened!). I don't remember how far we were from Company, but I am guessing within 20 NM? I think ATC mentioned the distance when we reported it, but I was busy trying to maintain aircraft control, so I didn't hear exactly what he said.  I should have analyzed with TCAS how far ahead and what direction the aircraft was that was making the pretty contrails. Pilot crews (me included) and ATC should be more aggressive at putting in route offsets when the potential for wake turbulence exists. Educating our crews on our FMS's offset function could help in that effort. I don't think Controllers are all that aware of the hazard.				B737-700 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence in cruise flight at FL340 from a preceding B737 that resulted in a sudden 30 degree bank left and then right.

During initial takeoff roll, we experienced directional control difficulty which caused us to veer to the left. I took control of the aircraft with nose wheel steering and brakes to stay on the runway. We successfully rejected the takeoff roll then continued to taxi to clear the runway because there was an aircraft on short final, and we felt a bit rushed. We never exceeded 30 knots. While we were handling the after reject procedures and clearing the runway, we thought we heard (misunderstood) the Controller say, 'clear left on Taxiway 1 and left on XY left.'  We turned left on Taxiway 1 then immediately left on Runway XXL and held our position. We then realized that we could not use Taxiway 2 to clear XXL since our wingspan was too big and I was not comfortable doing a 180 degree turn on XXL. The Tower was quick and professional to help us get a tug to push us backwards on XXL onto Taxiway 1. It took 30 minutes for the push back tug and for us to clear Runway XXL. We taxied back to XXC and took off uneventfully.Suggestions: During times of extreme workload, such as a RTO, issued instructions should be slow and methodical from the Pilot to ATC and ATC to the Pilot. We just finished an RTO, were busy completing the RTO procedures while clearing the runway for arriving traffic. We should have slowed our process down and clarified any taxi instructions.		I was the Pilot Flying on takeoff Runway XXC in ZZZ. The takeoff weight was around 150.000lbs and the RCR (Runway Condition Reading) was 5 with strong winds. Performance data required a bleed off takeoff. After the aircraft lineup on Runway XXC, the Captain gave me control of the aircraft for takeoff. I applied initial thrust of approximately 40 percent and after stabilization of the engines, I advanced the thrust levers. The aircraft immediately started to veer to the left. I reduced the thrust and disengaged the auto throttles. The Captain took control of the aircraft and I made the transmission to Tower stating the takeoff reject. Tower instructed us to clear Runway XXC via Taxiway 1.On Taxiway 1 we immediately turned left on Runway XXL and realized that we were stuck on Runway XXL. Tower instructed us to hold our position and was very professional and helpful organizing a tug to move us back in order to taxi via Taxiway 1 to Runway XXC. After discussing the possible reasons for our directional problems during takeoff and contacting Dispatch, we both agreed to attempt another takeoff. We departed Runway XXC uneventfully. The feeling of self-induced rush to clear the runway for the landing traffic after the takeoff reject, the unaccustomed environment in ZZZ and the high workload after the reject procedure might have contributed to the expectation bias resulting in misinterpretation/ incorrect execution of the Tower instructions. Inappropriate task management and channelized attention has led to the situation. Proper workload prioritization would have been the key to handle the situation correctly.The feeling of self-induced rush to clear the runway for the landing traffic after the takeoff reject, the unaccustomed environment in ZZZ and the high workload after the reject procedure might have contributed to the expectation bias resulting in misinterpretation/ incorrect execution of the Tower instructions.

Air carrier flight crew reported the aircraft veered left during takeoff resulting in a rejected takeoff.

Above us (at FL340) and ahead of us (10-20 nm) an aircraft reported to ATC they were unable to maintain altitude, and were in a climb above FL340. Within seconds of that call, we entered an area of moderate turbulence and an updraft. We too, were unable to maintain altitude and began to climb. To the best of my recollection, we climbed to FL302 before we entered the subsequent downdraft. Once the altitude came back down through FL300, the autopilot attempted to maintain the altitude, but the airspeed degraded below green dot and all the way to Alpha Protection (a-prot). Once at a-prot, we began to sink, to the best of my recollection, at about 800-1000 FPM to FL290. The entire time we were in moderate turbulence. Somewhere before reaching FL290, I reported to ATC the turbulence as well as the inability to maintain altitude. I had my eye on the TCAS as well, and the aircraft above was the only one that was nearby. There were no lower aircraft we could see that would be an issue. ATC gave us a 30 degree left turn for traffic (assuming it was for the aircraft above also sinking ahead of us). However, at this point, the autopilot had been disconnected and we did not make the turn. Everything happened incredibly quickly, and we were able to return to FL300 before making the turn. I advised ATC that we were back at assigned altitude, and I think we were recleared direct to a fix. By my best estimate, we initially descended out of FL300 to FL290 and back to FL300 in less than 2 minutes.The main cause of this event was the large cell of weather we flew through. We did not have a good picture of it with the onboard weather radar, as there was nothing other than green that I remember. I was rotating through several radar apps, and saw nothing alarming about our route.If I was presented with the information we had again, I don't think I would have done much different to avoid the weather. We simply did not know the weather was there. Once the event began, however, I could have done a better job helping the PF with making sure we made the turn as instructed by ATC. I was definitively task saturated making sure the airplane was still flying (aviating), and did not do as good at navigating and communicating as I could have.				Air carrier pilot reported unable to maintain altitude for several minutes due to encountering downdrafts and turbulence.

I started this day in ZZZ4 and deadheaded to ZZZ on Flight XXXX. I arrived at ZZZ at (local time) and I proceeded to the gate to prepare for our trip to ZZZ1 . The Operations Agent informed me that the Captain was en route on another flight that was supposed to arrive around our scheduled departure time of (time). I prepped the aircraft for the flight, as best as I could, and discussed with the Flight Attendants the flight time and weather conditions. I informed them that the first half of the flight was forecast to have light turbulence, but that the second half was likely to be turbulent due to a winter storm pushing through the area. We loaded XX Passengers on this flight.The Captain arrived at approximately (time). After he briefed the Flight Attendants, we briefed the flight and ran our flows and checklist, pushing back from the gate at about (time). We departed ZZZ at (time). Our route of flight was a departure off of Runway XX, then the ZZZZZ Departure...ZZZZZ...ZZZZZ1.ZZZZZ2. The departure and climb to FL400 were uneventful with just light turbulence. At ATC's request we were cleared to FL410 with our approval. Captain contacted the Flight Attendants shortly after departure and informed them that they could serve the cabin, and we turned off the Seatbelt Sign, as well, later when the Flight Attendants had time to serve our XX passengers. I made a PA asking the Passengers to keep their Seatbelts fastened while in their seats. Captain, after reviewing the route of flight on his iPad, stated to me that he wanted everyone seated in the cabin by the time we reached ZZZZZ intersection. He marked ZZZZZ on the FIX page as a reminder.We made several requests to ATC and were granted some short cuts along our route to avoid some buildup below us on radar. As we approached ZZZZZ, our ride began to deteriorate, and the Captain turned the Seatbelt Sign back on and informed the Cabin Crew to complete their service and take their seats. We noticed on radar some moderate to severe precipitation returns to our northwest that were below our cruising altitude, but we were downwind of, so as a precaution, the Captain began slowing the aircraft from Mach .78 to .76. We began to hear multiple reports from aircraft ahead of us of moderate turbulence, but the ATC controller didn't seem to have suggestions for altitudes or routes. Then ATC cleared us to cross 70 miles south of ZZZZZ1 at FL300. The Captain entered that into the FMC and stated that he would start the descent early since we had a very strong tailwind. As we started our descent, we began to encounter moderate turbulence.I reported the moderate turbulence to ATC. At FL35.5 we suddenly were hit with severe turbulence. The turbulence caused the autopilot to disengage, and the aircraft began descending and picking up airspeed rapidly. Our airspeed quickly shot above MMO to approximately Mach .82 and the clacker sounded. We were bumped around in the flight deck violently, but the Captain began hand flying the aircraft. He retarded the power levers and deployed the flight spoilers. I selected the Vertical Speed mode on the MCP and rolled the vertical speed back to about 500 FPM. It was difficult to see the flight instruments and to make control inputs due to the level of turbulence. The severe turbulence continued in the descent until we reached FL320, and it began to lighten up. At the Captain's request, I informed ATC of the severe turbulence and the applicable altitudes. After we were stabilized, the Captain contacted the Flight Attendants to see if everyone was alright in the cabin. The Flight Attendants stated that no one was injured and that everyone was properly seated and fastened during the episode. Captain  also made a Maintenance report via ACARS about the overspeed.Dispatch sent us an ACARs message asking for the location of the turbulence and asking if we had any injuries. I relayed this information back to Dispatch and informed them that we had no reported injuries on board. We continued our flight relatively uneventfully with pockets of light to some moderate turbulence on the arrival into ZZZ1. We completed an ILS approach into Runway XY at ZZZ1, landed at approximately (time), and pulled into our arrival Gate at (time). Captain and I completed our post-flight procedures and terminated the flight. The Captain immediately contacted Dispatch by telephone to make the proper logbook entries. Looking back on the events of this flight, I must commend Captain for doing such a fantastic job of handling this situation. He came into the flight having already worked through a stressful day flying from another location. Despite being late to the flight, he didn't rush getting ready for our trip and he was well aware of the weather that we faced. He made an excellent call in seating everyone prior to ZZZZZ, in slowing the aircraft down in anticipation of turbulence and in handling the momentary loss of control and overspeed on the aircraft. I do not know what we could have done to avoid this situation as many aircraft were reporting moderate turbulence at different flight levels and different areas. My takeaway from this is to appreciate getting to fly with some of the best Pilots in the industry, like my Captain, that got our Passengers to their destinations safely in such difficult situations, and who have the foresight to see potential issues like this one.Due to scheduling issues, the Captain arrived late to take command of Flight XXXX. I believe this caused me to feel a bit rushed in completing the flight on time. So, I would suggest better Pilot Scheduling could drastically reduce Pilot workload and pressure.		I was the PF that was rerouted off an AM two- day. I should have been completed by XA00 but now was flying this reroute landing 4.5 hours later at ZZZ1. There were six unused PM reserves in ZZZ2 that were legal for this ZZZ to ZZZ1 leg (four of these were two-day reserves). I state this because I should not have even been on this flight due to poor Operational Scheduling and misuse/under-utilization of reserves. I am a line holder but was treated like an online reserve, switching from an AM reserve slot to a PM reserve slot. I knew there was weather on this leg, which is why I was glad my original trip had me on the ground before this front came to the area. This later re-route put me right in the middle of it. I called Dispatch prior to departure, inquiring about the rides. He stated 'There is no severe turbulence along your route. I will keep you apprised along your way.' There were several weather advisories for moderate, especially from State X onward below FL380. We only had XX Passengers onboard. I told the Flight Attendants to get the service done and cleaned up in the first 30 minutes of the flight, since the rest of the trip looked extremely bumpy. We were at FL410 for the cruise portion of the flight which was smooth. We had the Flight Attendants and Passengers all down by ZZZZZ intersection and the aircraft secure, north of ZZZ3. We deviated a couple times for cells at our altitude and we were given a shortcut to ZZZZZ1. Another aircraft ahead of us in the descent stated they were in moderate turbulence not moderate chop and were quite emphatic about it. We were then given a crossing of 70 miles south of ZZZZZ1 at FL300.The winds were 240/168 at FL410 there was rain painting below us but only green and yellow no red or magenta on the radar. I called the Flight Attendants again about three minutes prior to our descent, to make sure everyone was seated. I started an early descent with the excessive tailwind in order to make the crossing to prevent the nose pitching over at the end of the descent in the lower 30,000's like it normally does, causing an overspeed. Another aircraft ahead of us then reported severe turbulence. I slowed the aircraft to .76 Mach. At FL385 we had moderate turbulence. By FL355 we encountered severe turbulence, the autopilot kicked off, the instruments were very difficult to read, I pulled out the speedbrake and then the speed clacker started for about 5-10 seconds. We reported severe turbulence and given a heading of 050 and down to FL300 for other descending traffic. the winds were now 240/119. I checked on the Flight Attendants and they said everyone was okay. We made a report to Dispatch and ATC of severe turbulence with no injuries or aircraft damage and passed to the Manager of the overspeed. If the previous aircraft did not call out severe turbulence, we would have not been as prepared as we were. We landed uneventfully and I called Dispatch/Manager and wrote up the severe turbulence in the logbook. No one claimed injuries as they left the aircraft.		B737-800 flight crew reported loss of aircraft control due to severe turbulence. After the Captain regained aircraft control the flight continued to destination with no injuries reported.

Captain was Pilot Flying (PF), I was Pilot Monitoring (PM). We departed behind a Company -800 which produced a great amount of wake turbulence that we encountered. Captain was hand-flying the aircraft and somewhere in preparation for departure, VNAV did not get properly armed. Neither of us noticed until he called 'Set Speed,' and I subliminally noticed in my head the speed bug did not jump up as it usually does. During that time, we began to encounter wake turbulence from the aircraft departing in front of us, which took both of our attention. We climbed above the altitude restriction of 'at or below 10,000 ft,' at HIDEF by about 1000 ft. Departure noticed and gave us a vector to climb and then direct another point down the departure. Nothing was said by ATC about the event.				B737-700 First Officer reported climbing through an altitude restriction departing DEN. A distracting wake turbulence encounter was cited as contributing.

I had just return to my seat after retrieving a crew meal and the Captain was coordinating with ZZZ Radio to deviate from course due to some weather that had popped up on the radar.  He requested 5 miles left of course to traverse the weather at a gap that was both visually clear and clear on the radar return.  ZZZ radio cleared us up to 10 miles left of course and the Captain selected another larger gap a little further left than the original 5-mile space selected.  The Captain called the Flight Attendants and informed them that we were about to encounter some weather and to stop any service taking place and to take their seats for a few minutes.  When we entered the weather there was some light chop and as we were about to exit, we hit some turbulence which caused an immediate loss of altitude of almost 500 feet.  The autopilot kicked off and the Captain immediately took control of the aircraft, ensured the autopilot was off and reduced airspeed to .76M then recovered the aircraft to its original airspeed and altitude before reengaging the autopilot.  The entire event was about 15-20 seconds in duration.  What was weird was that the turbulence that caused the altitude deviation was not extreme or severe and was barely moderate.  But it was like we hit a road bump then just dropped in altitude like in an elevator quickly and it was over. Following recovery, I heard the Flight Attendants checking in with each other in the back and while it caught everyone off guard no injuries or damages were reported.  The rest of the flight continued normally.  The Captain and I did some research to see how best to report the incident and what additional actions might be required and determined that we would each submit a report and that the Captain would submit an additional report for the altitude deviation.Cause: Weather event, possibly clear air turbulence associate with the weather we deviated for.Suggestions: Possibly making an even greater deviation for the weather?				B737 First Officer reported a sudden loss in altitude of 500 feet during cruise while the aircraft was passing through turbulence. Captain recovered aircraft and flight continued with no injuries or damage reported.

It was a normal takeoff. After 400 to 500 ft. AGL, we started our right turn to 025 degrees as per the departure procedures are required. During the turn, we were told to contact Departure. As I contacted Departure, they gave us a right turn direct to our next fix. Captain said that the plane wasn't flying right and said we are leveling off at 5000 ft. and remaining on current heading. He then told me to [request priority handling with ATC] and a return to field. He told me that the controls were snapping fully to the right and it was very hard to return the aileron position back to neutral. He then stated that banking the controls to the left was normal but banking it back to the right would snap the ailerons fully to the right again. We told Departure that we could only make left-hand turns and requested to return to the field for Runway XXC.We then continued to shallowly bank the plane to the left to avoid large control inputs that would cause snapping of the ailerons. Captain mentioned that he was holding the controls with extreme force. As he was flying, I set the plane up for the ILS XXC. I proceeded to look for a flight control QRH regarding the ailerons. I then gave the FAs (Flight Attendant) a call to let them know the situation and that we are landing in about 10 minutes. I then made a PA to the passengers that we had an indication that we needed to return to the airport. We lined up with [Runway] XXC and the Captain noticed as I extended flaps, he felt binding and snapping of the controls. We had an overweight landing with a smooth touchdown about 200 FPM. As the airplane slowed to around 10l kt., we both noticed the airplane wanting to veer to the right. The Captain applied pressure to correct for it. We exited the runway and taxied safely to the gate.Flight control issues with right deflections. This was the third flight with this issue. Maintenance needs to do a thorough inspection on the aircraft and test fly to make sure it is good for operation.	Reporter stated he has not had any feedback from Company as to the cause of the flight control anomaly.			B737 First Officer reported the aircraft was restricted to only making left turns due to a malfunction with the flight controls to the right. The flight crew performed an air turnback and as the aircraft slowed down after touchdown, the aircraft wanted to veer to the right. The First Officer stated that this was the third flight with this issue.

The Captain called Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss issue and options.  Upon conclusion of this discussion, it was determined the aircraft should return to ZZZ versus continuing to ZZZZ where parts and maintenance personnel limited. Initially notified ATC followed by a request for priority handling once the center tank was exhausted as wing tank quantity in left wing possibly inaccurate.  Aircraft landed without incident and taxied to gate.Factors that played a role and could negate future issues like this would be more frequently monitoring fuel on climb out.  This helps to verify balance remains as desired and if it deviates allows for more opportunity to disseminate root cause. Check of fuel balance at transition level on climb out aids in recognizing an issue like more quickly.				B737-800 First Officer reported a fuel imbalance indication in the left wing.

CA PF (Captain Pilot Flying), less than 300 hours in type. FO PM (First Officer Pilot Monitoring), less than 100 hours at this carrier. XXX souls on board. ZZZ RWY XXR. Flaps 5 takeoff. 26K thrust. Assumed temp 39C. 150,900 lbs. ZZZZZ SID. Night. Thin cloud layer at 5000 feet. Unrestricted visibility. This was a severe flight control malfunction. What follows is my best recollection of the event.     ZZZ Tower cleared us for takeoff on RWY XXR. During initial climb, at 500 feet AGL, I began a hand flown right hand turn in accordance with the ZZZZZ Departure. As I deflected the yoke to the right, it snapped forcefully right, and I experienced an extreme, uncommanded roll rate. I was struggling with both hands to stop the yoke from banking us beyond 30 degrees. The yoke was still commanding a greater roll rate. Startle factor was tremendous. I could not verbalize any words to the FO (PM). There were no master cautions, no master warnings, and no annunciator lights. Then suddenly the yoke became very light. As I moved the yoke back toward center, the extreme uncommanded roll rate kicked in to the left. I was experiencing severe longitudinal instability, and I was completely task saturated. With the instability, it was a struggle just to hold the wings level. I started making rapid commands to the FO: "Bug Up Bug!" "Bug 200!" "Bug our speed!" ZZZ Departure then told us something about turning right to a fix, and contacting center. I told the FO: "No, advise ATC, flight control malfunction, present heading, 5000 feet."While climbing on the 025 heading, I continued to give left and right yoke inputs to help with troubleshooting. Somewhere between 3000 ft and 5000 ft MSL I determined I could deflect the yoke left to make a left turn and the aircraft felt normal. However, when I moved the yoke back toward center, or if I had any yoke inputs right of center, it felt like my right aileron was going straight to the full up position. Wings level felt like I was trying to balance the roll axis on a needle point. Continual yoke inputs were required to keep the wings level. What was wrong? Aileron Jam? No, there isn't any binding. Hydraulics? No, I would have an annunciator light. Bad PCU? No, the good PCU would overpower the faulty one. Feel and centering mechanism? No, left turns feel normal. I wanted the aircraft on the ground ASAP because I didn't know how much longer we could maintain positive aircraft control; any further deterioration would likely be catastrophic. While on the 025 heading and 5000 feet, ZZZ assigned a right hand turn to some heading and I told the FO "No, we can only make wide left turns." He informed ZZZ accordingly. ZZZ assigned us a left turn to heading of 270. I spun the bank angle selector to 10 degrees and began a shallow banked left hand turn. As I rollout, on heading 270, the yoke tries to overpower me again, but I anticipate it, and manage to level the wings. Nothing is improving, but it also isn't getting worse. I'm adapting, anticipating, learning how to manage this longitudinal instability and the uncommanded roll rates. On crosswind, the FO asked me if I would like him to brief the flight attendants. This question helped bring me solidly back into focus. "Yes, tell the FAs we are returning to ZZZ, Precautionary Landing, 10 mins." Why precautionary? I still had normal control of my vertical axis and lateral axis. Winds 350. Little aileron needed, if any, so I can keep firm pressure on the yoke, maintain positive control, and complete a safe landing. Then the FO asked me if I wanted him to talk to the passengers. "Yes, tell them shortly after takeoff we had a small indication up front so we are returning to ZZZ to let our maintenance team look at the aircraft. We'll provide more information on the ground." ZZZ then gave us a turn to heading 180. I share with the FO what I'm experiencing, and that I may need his help to give me more left aileron input. I asked him to notify dispatchand to include "aileron malfunction" in the text. Next, I ask the FO to look through the QRH for anything flight control and aileron related. We couldn't find anything that fit our situation. Then I have the FO complete the After Takeoff Checklist, but keep the Flaps at 5, followed by the Descent Checklist. The FO asks if I wanted him to set up and brief the approach. "Yes." Then I told him we will do Flaps 30, Autobrake 3, and to run the Before Landing Checklist. ZZZ is trying to give us a base turn. I want more distance so I have room to make a 10 degree banked turn, and to gently correct an overshoot. The FO relays to ZZZ that we want a 20 mile final. I overshoot base to final a little so we are on approximately a 340 heading to join. ZZZ asks if we can turn right at all? "No." Controller says that is okay, that he will just give us a big left hand turn so we can rejoin. I tell the FO, "No, tell him we are joining from here. We will make it work." Why? It is going to take me 6-9 minutes to make a huge left turn and I don't know how much time we have before our problem gets worse. The priority is still to get on the ground ASAP. I hit the DATA button, see 4000 ft by the fix were pointing toward, and start making commands. "Bug 180…Flaps 10…Set 4000 feet…vertical speed down 1000 fpm…arm Approach Mode." When he selected Flaps 10, the yoke started pulling left and right while the flaps were in transit, but I'm able to overpower the yoke and keep our wings level. What is going on? Flaps and ailerons are independent systems. This should not be happening. "Set 3000 feet, vertical speed down 1000 fpm…Gear down, Flaps 15" and with the Flaps 15 selection here goes the yoke oscillating left and right again. "Flaps 25…Flaps 30…Below the Line." The yoke was pulling with each flap selection. I visually verify Gear Down and Green, Flaps 30, Speed Brake Armed. We are on the Glide Slope. There will not be a go around. Something inside told me I wanted a less aggressive brake application, so around 1000 feet I tell the FO to select Autobrakes 2. With continual lateral inputs I'm able to keep the aircraft balanced on the roll axis. At approximately 20 feet Tail Strike, Tail Strike, Tail Strike is flashing on my HUD. I relax a little back pressure. Smooth touch down. Fly the nose wheel down. CA "Manual Braking." FO "Autobrakes Off."  We are tracking centerline and there is a sudden jerk/pull to the right. Very odd. Like a sudden rudder kick, a grabby brake, or a right hand gust but winds are 350. I'm able to correct with brake and rudder. We slow to a near stop and clear at [taxiway] 1. Airport rescue and fire fighting asks if we require any assistance. "Tell him negative and thank you." ZZZ asks if we [are able to continue to gate]. "Yes." Ramp clears us straight in to the gate. ZZZ Ramp authorizes us to park with DGS (Docking Guidance System) only. I set the brake and we complete our shutdown flow. I tell the FO to keep the door closed. I need a minute to get myself composed. The severity of what we experienced is kicking in. I make a quick PA, "Ladies and Gentlemen, I spoke to our maintenance team and they want to take this aircraft to the hanger for troubleshooting, so please gather all of your belongings, exit the aircraft, go to the top of the jetway, and we will have further instructions. Thank you again for your patience." I had not really spoken to maintenance, but I knew the aircraft was done, and the FO and I were done. While the passengers were deplaning, I was able to finish my duties. I asked the FO to see if we had a tail strike. We did not. I called my dispatcher and he asked me if I landed overweight. This is when I was first aware that yes we landed overweight. I spoke to the Duty pilot, two local maintenance teams, and received a call from my Chief Pilot. The logbook entries took some time for me to complete, because I was trying to describe the malfunction with accurate wording, and because the aircraft maintenancelog discrepancy blocks are character limited. With 8 discrepancy entries complete, we turned the aircraft over to maintenance and went home.Reflection 1) Both pilots were needed to meet the demands of the situation. This is exactly why we must keep two pilots at the controls. I was incredibly saturated with maintaining aircraft control, and intensely thinking through the malfunction and appropriate tasks. When I gave commands to the FO, I had to trust that he was completing them exactly as I asked. I was only able to divert my attention for very brief moments to verify the big items: ILS Identifier, Gear Down and Green, Flaps 30, Speed Brakes Armed. Everything else was a bonus. The FO did a magnificent job of executing PM duties. Further, he led me with appropriate questions that helped pull me from being overwhelmed to managing the situation, and he perfectly executed PAs that are normally performed by the CA.Reflection 2) It may have been the right hand flight spoilers that were deflecting to full stop, and not an aileron problem. This would help explain why left turns were fine, but right turns were not. I don't know for certain because this fleet does not have synoptic pages.Reflection 3) After we were safely on the gate, I located two, less severe RH Aileron write ups approximately two weeks prior to this flight. If I had seen this information prior to the flight, I would have briefed it as a threat and experienced less startle factor when we experienced the severe uncommanded roll issue. Further, those write ups may also have been a flight spoiler issues but again, we pilots don't know for certain without supporting evidence from a flight control synoptic page.Cause: TBD. Unknown mechanical malfunction resulted in aircraft longitudinal instability and extreme uncommanded roll rates. Suggestions: This fleet must be equipped with system synoptic pages. Synoptic pages provide critical information to pilots during an emergency. If we had a flight control synoptic page, we would have observed exactly what was happening with our spoilers and ailerons, and responded appropriately. As it was, we were in the blind and having to guess as to what was happening with the primary and secondary flight controls. Further, the flight synoptic page would have allowed us to create more precise write ups, thus focusing the efforts of our maintenance team, and returning the aircraft to service sooner. Additionally, my three day lookback in the aircraft maintenance log didn't reveal previous RH Aileron issues. From now on, I will do a two week review of the log.				B737-800 Captain reported severe flight control malfunction during initial climb that required substantial manual control to maintain wings level. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed safely.

As we taxied onto the runway, the Company flight behind us reported flames and fire coming from the exhaust of the #1 Engine. We advised ZZZ Tower we were canceling our takeoff clearance and requested to exit the runway. Engine power was never advanced above taxi thrust settings. ZZZ Tower cleared us to taxi down Runway XXR and exit left onto Taxiway 1. As we taxied, I placed the #1 Engine start lever to cutoff. At this time, the Company Aircraft that had been behind us, informed us the flames and fire were increasing and stated we needed to shut down #1, which had already occurred. We asked ZZZ Tower if we could exit at Taxiway 2, which was immediately to the left of our position, and requested that Airport Fire Equipment be sent to our location. Once stopped on Taxiway 2, we performed the Engine Tailpipe Fire QRH Checklist. We never had any fire indications on the flight deck. Once the QRH procedure was completed, the Fire Truck checked the outside of the aircraft and reported no sign of fire or any visible damage to the aircraft. They also reported that the temperatures they took were within normal ranges. We coordinated with ZZZ Station Ops to return to Gate X, and ATC cleared us to the gate via Taxiways 2, 3 and 4. We requested that a fire truck follow us to the gate to watch for reignition of the tailpipe fire. As we taxied to the gate, we noticed an oily smell of the flight deck, which the F/As confirmed in the cabin. Once at the gate, the Passengers were deplaned through the jetbridge. We were met at the gate by ZZZ Maintenance Control, and they confirmed the tailpipe of the #1 Engine was covered in a fluid that was likely bearing grease/oil, and they were taking the aircraft out of service. A logbook entry was made, and notifications to Dispatch, Maintenance Control, Supervisor, and Operations Chief Pilot were completed. A subsequent debriefing of the event was completed with Dispatch, Maintenance Control, Supervisor, and Operations Chief Pilot once we were in the terminal area.This was an unexpected engine malfunction. I am not sure much can be done to prevent and unexpected like this one.		While taxiing onto Runway XXR, a Company aircraft behind us told us, over the Tower frequency, that we had fire/flames coming out of the exhaust section of Engine 1. We taxied off the runway and onto Taxiway 2, where we ran the QRH and waited for fire rescue to arrive. After QRH completion and Fire Rescue inspection, which revealed no fire presence, we taxied back to the gate.		B737 flight crew reported an engine tailpipe fire while taxiing onto the runway. Flight crew shut down the affected engine, fire was extinguished, and aircraft taxied to gate where it was taken out of service.

I looked at the engine gauges and saw the #1 N1 roll back to about 40 percent and spool back to normal. About a minute later the airframe shuttered again and the same roll back occurred. It was about this time that we got a call from the FAs (Flight Attendant) that there was a noticeable flame that was seen out the back of the #1 Engine. I disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle and recoordinated the aircraft. We decided that the most appropriate action at this point was to shut the engine down and secure it. We ran the appropriate checklists and [requested priority handling] and requested that emergency vehicles inspect the aircraft after landing before taxiing to the gate. Approach and landing were executed without further incident. After parking at the gate, we also had engine control lights illuminated and the A Hydraulic System was showing 74 percent RF (Refill).		While approaching top of descent, experienced significant airframe shudder/vibration followed by #1 Engine rollback. Had a second similar event followed by passenger reports of flames coming from #1 Engine. We decided to shut down the #1 Engine and completed the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist. We performed an uneventful single engine approach and landing to Runway XXL at ZZZ.		B737-700 flight crew reported the #1 Engine rolled back and had flames coming out of it during the top of descent. The affected was shut down and the flight crew made an uneventful landing without incident.

Aircraft taxied down Taxiway 1 which was covered with snow, partially compacted. Aircraft was cleared for takeoff on Runway XXL full length. We had run performance data for windshear and briefed the precautionary windshear profile as ATIS was reporting low level windshear advisories were in effect - wind was 310/15G25. After raising the power to 40 percent N1, I pushed TO/GA and the thrust levers accelerated to max takeoff power. As soon as the aircraft started to accelerate, the aircraft started to veer to the right. I applied left rudder and the aircraft started to come back to centerline. Approaching centerline, I reduced left rudder and added right rudder, but the aircraft continued to the left through centerline and was not correcting. I made the decision to reject the takeoff at approximately 60 - 65 KIAS. As we slowed through about 20 - 30 kt. the aircraft started to slide on the runway even with full brakes applied. We stopped on the runway and then taxied clear. Total distance from brakes release to taxiing clear of the runway was approximately 2,000 ft.I thought that the nose wheel was aligned with the runway centerline, but the possibility certainly exists that it was slightly canted to the right. I underestimated the runway conditions which I feel exacerbated any misalignment that may have existed prior to takeoff power being applied.				B737-700 Captain reported rejecting takeoff due to the runway conditions and its impact on the aircraft as it began to accelerate.

As we were climbing out of FL230, I noticed arcing in the heating element of the left side, forward windshield (L1). I called for the Arcing Windshield QRH, which the First Officer found under the Window Damage - Forward section. The QRH called for the window heat switch of the affected window to be turned OFF, which we did. We completed the QRH for an arcing window and less than a minute later, the L1 Window cracked, with a loud snapping sound. Within another 30 seconds we heard and saw another crack streak across the same window. By now we had reached FL250, and we asked ATC for an immediate descent to 10,000 ft. because I was concerned about more extensive damage to the window. I called for the First Officer  (FO) to continue the Window Damage QRH - Cracked or Shattered part of the same section. We continued descending and finished the QRH. We determined that the cracking was on the outer pane of the L1 window.  Even though the QRH directs continued normal operations for outer pane cracking, I used my Captain's emergency authority to determine that the safest course of action was to divert to ZZZ2. We informed ATC of our intentions and they asked for the number of souls on board and amount of fuel in time. An [priority was requested], and emergency equipment was standing by in ZZZ2. I called the Flight Attendants with X chimes and told the A Flight Attendant (F/A) that we had experienced a cracked window and were descending to divert, that we would be landing in 12 minutes and to secure the cabin for arrival. I also told him to expect a normal landing and taxi to the gate. Then I made a PA to the Passengers informing them that, out of an abundance of caution, we were diverting to ZZZ2 due to a Maintenance issue. ATC had informed Dispatch of our intentions, and we received an amended release over ACARS for our diversion to ZZZ2. I reprogrammed the FMC for our arrival to ZZZ2 while the FO obtained the ATIS and ran the numbers for landing. I asked for the Diversion Plan on the checklist, and we reset the pressurization for ZZZ2 field elevation, as well as making sure all the other items on the Diversion Plan had been addressed, which they were.  By now we were nearing the airport and getting vectors from ZZZ2 approach for Runway XXL. The weather was > 10 miles visibility and clear skies. We discussed the overweight landing and agreed to run the brake cooling numbers after we landed. We made a normal landing and exited Runway XXL using minimal wheel braking (initiated less than 80 knots). I stopped the aircraft on Taxiway 1 and held the brakes with the foot pedals while I spoke with the Fire Chief on a discreet frequency. I asked him to inspect the main gear for any sign of damage. He used a heat gun and said temperatures were normal. Meanwhile, the FO ran the numbers for brake cooling, and we received the message that limits had not been exceeded, meaning we could continue to the gate. The fire trucks followed us to the gate. We parked, shutdown and the Passengers deplaned normally through the forward entry door. I filled out the aircraft logbook for the arcing/cracking windshield and the overweight landing (separately). I called Dispatch and spoke with the manager of Dispatch about the flight. I also spoke with Maintenance Control about the write ups in the logbook. We left the aircraft with ZZZ2 local Maintenance. I debriefed the F/A's and the FO, and we all found ourselves in adequate condition to continue to ZZZ1 (on a different aircraft), which we did with all but 2 Passengers who deplaned in ZZZ2. That flight was operated without incident to ZZZ1.I do not feel anything could have prevented the malfunction. With one small crack in the outer pane I would have felt more confident continuing the flight to ZZZ1 as the QRH allowed. But with two large, deep crack across the L1 window, I was concerned that more cracks could develop and compromise the integrity of the window. I felt the safest course of action was to divert, especially since we were close to ZZZ2 at the time of the malfunction.				B737 Captain reported a cockpit window failure while in climb to cruise altitude. The Captain diverted to a nearby airport and landed safely.

Oceanic clearance received. Approx 30 min from reaching oceanic entry point ZZZZZ, the FO (First Officer) FMC display locked into the MENU (SAT) display.  No instrumentation, EICAS or status message for an R FMC failure displayed. Contacted Dispatch via SAT phone, requested patch to Maintenance Control. Explained situation, all attempts at selection useless. Unable to access FMS inputs from the R FMS display. Requested permission to pull and reset CB (Circuit Breaker) to reset FMS Display, maintenance control stated that no history of previous write-up. Maintenance control provided the exact CB location for R FMC display but stated that they could not authorize a CB recycle but that I was free to use my Captain's discretion. I requested to check with the maintenance control supervisor if they would approve a CB recycle. While on hold, I looked through the maintenance log - Discovered exact same situation written up X days previously with corrective action of 'reset procedures followed, ops check good' When Maintenance Control came back on the line, I provided logbook page number with previous write-up. Maintenance control stated 'I wonder why it didn't show up in my search?' We reviewed the MEL for operation with a single FMC and ETOPS prohibited with operation limited to the USA contiguous 48 states. Maintenance control and dispatch said 'that technically, we could enter ETOPS airspace since we had 2 operating FMC's.' I stated to both Maintenance Control and Dispatch that we were effectively a single FMC operation as we had no control or ability to input anything via the R FMC display and used the analogy of having a working TV (FMS) but with no remote or buttons to change the channel, volume or power on or off, and I am operating on the premise that we are now in a single FMC condition. I also further emphasized that if the L FMC Display also locked up or failed, we would have ZERO ability to uplink, enter or review ANY route, winds, performance, holding, progress, position or navigation information. Because we had not yet entered oceanic airspace, I made the decision, after consulting with the other 2 pilots and with dispatch concurrence, that we would return to ZZZZ. I also clearly stated that we would NOT be [requesting priority handling] since all systems were nominal (with the exception of the R FMC display) and that while we were now at approx 505.0K lbs GWT and 45.0K lbs above our maximum landing weight of 460.0K lbs, I elected to not jettison fuel but to fly towards ZZZZ and while at a lower altitude in the terminal area, request holding to burn down to our our max landing weight of 460.0K lbs before exiting the hold to proceed towards landing. This was accomplished in cooperation with ATC.  The flight attendants and passengers were fully informed of the return to ZZZZ and the basic reason why. Because of the time required to return back to the ZZZZ terminal area, I directed the flight attendants to continue with the passenger meal service that they had already started as it would be completed long before we began our descent into the terminal area to hold. Again, we did not [request priority handling] nor did we jettison fuel.  After  reaching our maximum landing weight of 460.0K lbs in the hold, we informed ATC that we could now proceed inbound to ZZZZ for landing. We were informed by ZZZZ operations that we would be parking at a hardstand and that the passengers were to remain onboard as ZZZZ MX (Maintenance) crews would be waiting to immediately board the aircraft and assess the situation. The approach, landing and taxiing to parking were all normal. After approx 20 min at the hardstand, with the passengers still aboard (including wheelchair passengers) we were informed that the flight had been 'delayed' until the following day. After all the passengers had been deplaned, we had crew lodging secured for the night and proceeded to the hotel. Upon returning to the same aircraft the next day, we noted in the maintenance log that the R FMC had been replaced, along with clearing out a previous MEL (blower unit). Of particular interest, we did note that in the maintenance log, it was stated by mx that the CDU (control display panel) operating software was out of date and was updated by ZZZZ mx.Having served previously as a MX Test pilot and other various roles on the Airbus 320, I feel it would be extremely beneficial if there was an authorized way to recycle a CB inflight as conditions warrant, with the concurrence of Maintenance Control (upon arrival in ZZZZ, the MX crews recycled the CB and the FMC unlocked and resumed normal operation).Also, I felt that there was an undertone not only to reset the CB at my own risk (which I refuse to do without Maintenance Control direction) but to continue on and enter into ETOPS airspace because it was 'technically' allowed to do so, even to the point that I was informed that Dispatch had contacted both ZZZZ and ZZZZ1 Oceanic control and that 'they had no problem with me continuing.'The company Threat and Error Management (TEM) that we are supposed to be guided by (and that I have personally taught to literally hundred of line pilots for over 15 years), clearly and unequivocally states and emphasized point of actively assess if what you are doing, or considering doing, is sensible.Continuing on, entering into ZZZZ1 Airspace and crossing the ocean with, for all practical purposes, only 1 fully functional FMC is both not sensible but increases the risk factor significantly. I personally have noted while in initial B-777 flight training, the lack of any reference, let alone emphasis, on the TEM at any level. In my opinion, Flight Training needs to correct this mindset and increase the emphasis and practicality of the TEM across the entire training platform and across all fleet types.				Air carrier Captain reported an FMC failure in cruise prior to oceanic entry point resulted in return to departure airport.

At the time we were burning fuel from the center tank and the wing tanks should have both been full. Not long after, the IMBAL Alert illuminated. We began the QRH and started assessing our fuel plan. By this point our #1 Wing Tank was approximately 1,000 lbs less than the #2 Wing Tank. We noticed that we were going to be about 2000 pounds less than the fuel remaining at ZZZ waypoint ahead. Following the QRH it led us to the Engine Fuel Leak Checklist and continued to the One Engine Inoperative Checklist.After shutting the engine down, the fuel in the #1 Wing Tank no longer was decreasing and we were able to balance the fuel by burning only from the #2 Wing Tank. We [requested priority handling] and diverted to ZZZ. Upon landing in ZZZ we stopped on the runway and had CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) inspect the aircraft. After their assessment, they said that there was not a leak detected and they followed us to the gate. CFR evaluated the aircraft at the gate and deemed that no leaks were detected before leaving. Of note, we attempted to notify Dispatch via ACARS but did not complete the task due to time compression as we diverted to ZZZ.				B737 First Officer reported a fuel imbalance developed in cruise. Flight crew shut down an engine, rebalanced fuel and diverted to a landing.

CA (Captain) answered cabin call; FAs (Flight Attendants) notified him an IFE (In-flight Entertainment) screen smoking. Multiple pax smelled smoke, FAs retrieved fire extinguisher. CA relayed FA's message to me and CA selected IFE/PASS seats power switch off and we ran smoke, fire, fume memory items (mask not necessary and the cabin and crew communications were established). CA assigned PF (Pilot Flying) duties and ATC to me, he continued to talk to FAs about status of smoke while calling via SATCOM to dispatch and asking for a maintenance control patch. I called up and began accomplishing the smoke, fire, fumes Electronic checklist. Shortly after CA selected the IFE/PASS seats power off, the FAs reported to him that the smoke had stopped and dissipated from cabin. They did not need to use the extinguisher and they moved the passenger from the seat. We had accomplished the smoke, fire, fumes electronic checklist up to the step of Turing off the APU bleed when the call with Dispatch and maintenance control connected. CA relayed actions to stop smoke and fumes with maintenance control, and queried about turning equipment back on/ leaving equipment on that did not cause smoke as the smoke clearly came from the IFE screen, was now powered off, and was no longer smoking (gasper fan, recirc fans, APU bleed were items electronic checklist called to be turned off). Maintenance Control noted that as IFE/PASS seats power switch remained off, CA discretion / okay to turn items not related to smoke back on - also a step in checklist provided that option ('Restore unpowered items at the Captain's discretion')- we completed electronic checklist. After accomplishing the electronic checklist, I listened to the SATCOM call with low volume to build situational awareness from dispatch while focusing on flying the aircraft and listening to ATC. I did not hear any of the FA to captain communication and relied on the CA to relay relevant info from the FAs. After the electronic checklist was complete, and while CA was talking to dispatch and maintenance control, I also sent for METAR and TAF weather at ZZZ1 [airport] via ACARS and checked the weather when the reports returned to the aircraft ACARs COMM. While working the satcom call and getting updates from the FAs via the handset, the CA asked my thoughts on continuing / diverting. I recommended we consult with dispatch and strongly consider a divert to ZZZ1 [airport] and relayed the weather I just checked at ZZZ1 [airport]. He agreed and said let's not go past ZZZ [VOR] (about 80 miles to the south of our position at that time). As CA resumed talking to dispatch about diverting to ZZZ1 [airport] via SATCOM, I turned SATCOM volume down and remained focused on flying and ATC communication. While CA was talking to dispatch, I called ZZZ1 Center ATC and advised them that we were working an issue in the cabin and would likely not proceed past ZZZ [VOR]. ATC asked if we were diverting and I replied that we were still gathering info and making the decision but that we were looking at ZZZ1 [airport] for a divert option. ATC asked nature of the issue and I explained we had a flight entertainment monitor that was smoking but all indications were that the smoke source had stopped, we removed electric power to the screen, and smoke had dissipated. As CA made decision to divert to ZZZ1 [airport] with dispatch I coordinated with ATC for diversion and flew the aircraft (left turn back to heading and then direct to ZZZZZ on ZZZZZ1 STAR). I entered ZZZ1 [airport] into the RTE page as the destination. ATC Asked if we were [requesting priority handling] and I started to tell them 'yes' when the CA (internally to our flight deck and not on ATC) stopped me from finishing 'yes' and advised me NOT to. CA had better situational awareness of the smoke status in the cabin as he spoke directly to FAs and I only heardwhat he relayed. He assured me the smoke stopped and dissipated. So I confirmed with ATC that we were not [requesting priority handling] and that the smoke stopped and had dissipated, but we desired a diversion to ZZZ1 [airport]. CA Notified FAs and made PA to pax about the situation and the diversion to ZZZ1 [airport]. CA continued to advise FAs to remain in communication and report any changes to the status of the smoke and temperature of the IFE screen.On the arrival while CA was making calls to FAs and pax PA, I asked ATC for a heads up on a expected runway and approach as the ATIS listed multiple approach and runway options (XXL, XXR, XY). ATC stated they would relay my request. After not getting an answer after several more minutes I requested the RNAV Y XXR. ATC then replied we could expect the ILS XY. I loaded the ILS XY approach. I was trying to prevent having to go heads down at a lower altitude so that I could remain more focused on backing up the CA with the flight path. CA took ATC/PM (pilot monitoring) role back, briefed arrival and approach, ran descent checklist, and was asked by ATC for SOB (souls on board) and fuel remaining. CA then took control of aircraft back and I resumed PM duties. We discussed and agreed that the diversion QRC could wait until after we landed and parked. CA Flew arrival, approach, and Landed at ZZZ1 [airport] uneventfully. ATC approach and tower both asked if we were [requesting priority handling] and both times I replied that we were NOT (in accordance with CA direction). Despite these replies, the fire trucks were waiting near runway XY and after we cleared the runway the fire crash rescue reported to ATC they would still follow us to the gate. After initial call from FAs, there was no recurrence of smoke, and while monitor initially was hot it was later described as warm. CA relayed this info but I never heard any of the reports directly from the FAs as I acted as PF and handled ATC and the QRH. The CA did a great job of keeping me informed of the cabin status and words from maintenance control and dispatch. I also felt very much included in the process and could not have asked for better CRM with a CA.ATC (ZZZ1 center, approach, tower) were very helpful and professional. Completed smoke event paperwork with maintenance after parking. Debriefed flight with CA. Flight felt very much like a training scenario - glad to have had the training we do for this type of event. In hindsight, during preflight prep, CA and I discussed that ZZZ2 [airport] was a dispatch alternate, ZZZ2 [airport] forecast weather was not the best (storms, wind and rain) but would work - and that ZZZ1 [airport] was a more practical flight divert versus the dispatch flight planning alternate. I would have preferred to [request priority handling] in this scenario but I did not feel that it was unsafe not to do so and I did not feel that it was worth the time in pushing back on the CA's call to NOT [request priority handling]. It would have added talk - discussion time without much added value. If at any time the smoke returned I would have pushed to [request priority handling]. The timing / location of the event made for a very busy arrival, but manageable with the CAs assignment of duties and very efficient for getting on the ground relatively quickly after the initial event.		We were 20 mins north of ZZZ [VOR] @ FL 350. ZZZ1 [airport] was approximately 200 nm east with bad weather en route and in their local area.  After ZZZ [VOR] we were planned to transition to be overwater for the next 90 minutes.  We received a cabin call from a FA (flight attendant) who stated there was 'smoke in the cabin. We are getting the fire extinguisher. We will get back to you.' FAs established a point of contact with the flight deck, designated a FA to handle the smoke issue, and provided us with updates as able - later reported as coming from a video monitor. I was PF (pilot flying), transferred the aircraft and radios to the FO (First Officer) as I coordinated with the FAs and tried to filter the incoming details.  As the situation developed, we concurrently ran the smoke, fumes, or fire checklist and contacted Dispatch/maintenance control.  FAs did a nice job following their procedures: they kept in good contact, eventually reseated pax (passengers), and recruited [a] pilot to monitor the problematic seat and entertainment equipment.  As time progressed I felt the situation in the cabin was safe and under control.  Initially we set ZZZ [VOR] as a limit/ decision point to resolve the cabin issue as I did not want to be troubleshooting a checklist with unclear resolution and dealing with international ATC communications, potential overwater divert procedures, route reversal in international airspace, lack of overwater alternates, and intermittent SATCOM communications. Filtering information from the cabin took some effort as the FA tasked with communicating with the flightdeck was not initially involved with the smoke, she was presenting second or third hand information so understandably she lacked a lot of details (I felt she did a good job, she let me know what she did and did not know, she was consistently easy to reach, and she followed through on getting answers to my questions.)  As I later gained access to first hand info from those on the scene, I reevaluated the situation. This was the most difficult part of the scenario - integrating details from 2 or 3 different cabin perspectives from FAs that had varying degrees of involvement at different times; and the information was presented to me out of sequence (again understandable given the situation).  It was definitely not a linear flow, nor could that be expected. It now appeared that the smoke was more extensive than a wisp or two and that more equipment was involved than the originally reported video monitor. FAs reported that non-colocated entertainment equipment beneath the seat was very hot. The equipment later cooled to just 'warm'. Still felt the situation was stable in the back, checklists had fixed the problems. Since we were approaching ZZZ [VOR] at this point, I decided diverting to ZZZ1 [airport] was the safest option. Thanks to Dispatch/maintenance control for the help. FO did an excellent job with managing ATC comm and workload management. At each change of the route/ altitude, as I cleaned up details in the back and coordinated the divert, he made sure I was aware of the changes so I could back him up to prevent pilot induced errors. Strong descent, ATC, workload, and CRM management skills on his part. Workload was high as the divert progressed, we transitioned from irregular workflows back to normal workflows with FO still flying as I cleaned up details for the divert and arrival. I transitioned back to PF (pilot flying). We discussed the divert guide and tasks, but did not have time to reference it until after landing due to arrival severe weather and turbulence.  All divert items were accomplished. No [priority handling requested]. Fire extinguisher was not used. No ATC or SOP violations occurred that I am aware of.		Air carrier flight crew reported a flight entertainment monitor began to emit smoke during cruise then eventually stopped. Flight crew completed a diversion and safe landing.

After looking at the systems page and noting that we just needed to taxi straight ahead 100 feet to clear the runway, we slowly cleared the runway and informed the tower. We then ran the Wheel NWS (Nose Wheel Steering) fault checklist and reset the anti-ski NWS switch which corrected the problem.  We taxied uneventfully to the gate at or below 10 knots per the checklist, wrote up the fault, debriefed maintenance, and called the Chief Pilot.

We are lucky we didn't snap an elevator cable as Boeing states if you apply pressure on the yoke when applying hydraulic pressure an elevator cable can snap. We had 2 events with the same pressure applied. Months later I question if Maintenance checked the cable for early fatigue. If not, should this plane be checked now?Maintenance incorrectly rigged elevator stab and flight control switch panel had a switch that did not fully close, so we were in manual reversion prior to the steps in the procedure. Second flight had same issue as Maintenance only fixed flight control switch panel. 3rd flight issue was corrected. A hangar that traditionally worked on wide body aircraft did the rig.

B737-800 pilot reported the aircraft abruptly pitched up while doing a flight control test and the aircraft was almost uncontrollable. According to the reporter Maintenance had performed incorrect work on flight controls, possibly due to inexperience with the aircraft.

Almost immediately the ANTI SKID INOP came on and continued to light intermittently for the duration of the flight. We asked for delay vectors and followed guidance to plan our next steps. We discussed the guidance in manual and decided that due to the ANTI SKID INOP light and vibrations that further damage was likely. We concluded that the safest course of action was to keep the gear extended and return to the departure airport for landing. Concern about further damage also led us to coordinate a low pass so that the Tower, as well as an aircraft holding short, could inspect the undercarriage. Low light conditions prevented them from seeing any details, other than to remark that there was no obvious damage.We executed the QRH ANTISKID INOP Checklist, requested non-normal landing data, and requested brake cooling data. Landing weight was well below maximum and there was no cooling time required. At this point, we transferred controls for a left seat landing, which was performed without incident. The aircraft pulled slightly to the left and had a small list to the left. After Fire and Rescue performed an inspection, we taxied to the gate. The postflight walkaround revealed failure of the left inner main gear tire, with damage to the nose gear door, underside of the wing, as well as the antiskid system and hydraulic lines which resulted in a hydraulic leak.		Just after 80 knots I noticed a slight vibration in the aircraft. It grew at a slow rate as we approached rotation speed. At rotation speed I noticed a black object, which I mistook as a bird, momentarily pass us on our left hand side. After liftoff, the Pilot Monitoring noticed that the ANTI SKID INOP light was on and would flash intermittently. This light continued in this manner for the remainder of the flight. We asked for vectors to keep us close to the airport. Then we used company guidance to work on the problem. We left the landing gear down initially since we didn't know what had happened and didn't want to possibly cause more damage. We then ran through the QRH and the manual. After working through these sections, we resolved to keep the landing gear down and return to our originating airport. We swapped roles at this point, and I became the Pilot Monitoring. We executed a low approach to see if Tower or another aircraft could verify any damage that had occurred. The lighting at that time of day prevented them from properly seeing any damage. We then asked for additional vectors to run the QRH ANTISKID INOP checklist, request non-normal landing data and brake cooling. Our landing weight was within limits and brake cooling was no factor. We swapped roles for this, so I was Pilot Flying during this time. After completion, I became Pilot Monitoring again. We proceeded inbound and landed without complications. There was a small left pull on the ground. Fire and rescue inspected us on the runway and then followed us to the gate once we were cleared. Postflight walkaround showed that the left inner main gear tire had failed which then caused damage to the nose gear door, underside of the wing, and anti-skid and hydraulic lines.		B737-700 flight crew reported a piece of tire tread departed a tire during rotation. Flight crew kept landing gear extended, returned to departure airport and landed.

Climbing through FL270 in IMC with engine anti-ice on we experienced a loud bang followed by high airframe vibrations and uncommanded N1 rollback on the #1 Engine. The autopilot kicked off and the Captain hand flew the aircraft. We ran the engine severe damage QRC followed by the QRH. We [requested priority handling] and began a shallow descent to FL190. At that point we reengaged the autopilot and swapped controls. I took over Pilot Flying duties while the Captain reviewed the checklists and contacted Dispatch via radio patch. The Captain, Dispatcher, and I decided to divert to ZZZ. we returned to ZZZ and the Captain landed without incident.		A B737-700 flight crew reported a loud bang followed by excessive vibration in one engine and diverted to a nearby airport.

I was PF (Pilot Flying). The autopilot was on. The autopilot remained engaged. I shallowed the climb. We analyzed the situation and determined that the # 2 Engine had seized. I instructed the FO (First Officer) to [request priority handling] with ATC and ask for a turn back to ZZZ. We completed the Engine Failure Severe Damage QRC and then I transferred control to the FO, while I completed the checklists. I advised the Flight Attendants and asked if they saw or smelled anything unusual. They were aware that the engine had failed and described a large fireball that erupted briefly from the engine. I sent a diversion ACARS message to Dispatch with the note, "Engine failure" in the comments section. I also called ZZZ Ops and ensured they knew we were returning, and that Dispatch was aware. I updated the performance data and sent for landing data for Runway XX. I only sent for flaps 30 numbers as I was getting task loaded at this point and ATC had just turned us onto a final approach. I knew the runway was one of the longest, so I wasn't really concerned with having the exact stopping margin. Had I sent for the Flaps 15 Engine Failure numbers, I would have also received the prompt for brake cooling numbers. With the distraction of coordinating with ATC and ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting), we did not check those after landing. I took control at about 1,000ft agl. We were a little fast and I used the speedbrake at flaps 15 to slow us down. We were also slightly low on the PAPI, but I was able to easily correct, and we landed uneventfully in the Touchdown Zone. I stopped the aircraft in the runway and instructed the ARFF Crew to inspect the entire aircraft. After receiving the "All Clear," we taxied to the gate.				Air carrier Captain reported an engine failure during climb. The pilots turned back to the departure airport.

Oil quantity was indicating 0. I asked the FO (First Officer) to run the checklist and I took the aircraft and accomplished the immediate action item for Engine Limit Surge or Stall. I disconnected the auto-throttles and retarded thrust lever on the number one engine to idle. The low oil indication did not change but was still in the amber range. Shortly thereafter the oil pressure went into the red range and we got a flashing amber indication on the number one engine. We immediately requested a descent to FL220 and accomplished a drift down with a level change and airspeed set to 240 KIAS. Continuing with the checklist it directed us to shutdown the engine which we confirmed and accomplished. I would estimate the engine only ran for 1-2 minutes with abnormal indication before shutdown. We checked the checklist for ENG out and confirmed FL220 as optimum. At this point we determined ZZZ was only 38 miles away. We [advised ATC] and the intention to divert to ZZZ. I sent a quick message to dispatch and changed the destination to ZZZ and reset the destination field elevation. Since we had significant altitude to lose we had time to alert the FAs (Flight Attendants) with a phone call and I made a PA to the passengers.The rest of the arrival and descent was relatively uneventful. We asked for Rwy XXR as it is the longest. Upon taxiing clear of the runway emergency vehicles met the aircraft and confirmed leaking fluid from the number one engine. We taxied to the gate with emergency vehicles following out of an abundance of caution. Deplaning was uneventful.		I was the PF (Pilot Flying) operating ZZZ1-ZZZ2. While in cruise, at FL300, we noticed an issue with the number 1 engine oil quantity. The quantity had begun to drop to 0 and the number was boxed white. Initially it was thought to maybe be a false indication, as the remainder of the engine indications appeared normal. However, after about a minute we observed the oil pressure in the number 1 engine begin to fall. The indication then transitioned into the Amber and Red bands. Both the CA (Captain) and I agreed that it was not an abnormal indication, and it was in fact an actual issue. We elected to shutdown the number 1 engine by pulling the thrust lever to idle IAW (In accordance with) the "Engine Shut Down" checklist. During this time flight controls were transferred to the CA, who became the PF, and I assumed PM (Pilot Monitoring). The total time the indication of oil quantity 0 and Oil pressure falling, was only a minute or two until the engine shut down procedure was completed. At this point, I initially began to run the "Engine Fire, Severe Damage, or Separation Checklist" which the CA corrected me on and we determined that we needed to run the "Engine Shut Down - NG" checklist. We [requested priority handling], and advised ATC of the number 1 Engine issue and shut down. We communicated souls and fuel on board and advised ATC that we required a little more time to troubleshoot and setup and that ZZZ would be our diversion airport. The above mentioned checklist was completed which then directed us to the "One Engine Inoperative Landing" checklist. We worked through all the steps at the appropriate times, "Deferred Items", and "Before Landing". We then advised ATC we would like runway XXR given it's length and our overweight nature and single engine configuration. Given our distance to ZZZ (~50nm), it was determined this was also the best option for safety and operational reasons. We loaded the RNAV [runway] XXR into the FMC and began our approach with initial vectors from ATC to the final approach course for runway XXR. While on final for XXR we completed the "Landing Checklist" via the QRH and landed uneventfully.After landing, we made the determination we could safely clear runway XXR and perform our assessments on taxiway 1. There, we completed our after landing flows and coordinated with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to have them inspect the number 1 engine. During their assessment they were able to determine that there was fluid leaking from the number one engine. This fluid we assumed as being engine oil. We then coordinated with operations and ATC and chose to taxi to gate 1. We asked that ARFF follow us to the gate as a precaution. Upon parking we completed our flows and the Parking Checklist and deplaned the passengers without incident.During our debrief, the CA and I found three areas in which we could have improved upon. One, was the original "Engine Fire, Severe Damage and Separation" checklist that I selected. As a team we determined as soon as we got to the fire handle step that we were in the incorrect checklist and then proceeded to the proper one.Second, was that we did not "verbalize" the Drift Down checklist per the QRC. We attributed this to experience and the fact that we were near ZZZ and starting a descent already using LVL Change as we had referenced the VNAV engine out page which stated ~22,400ft. We had already requested a descent to FL220 so we agreed we were on the way to a safe altitude and airspeed. We also started the APU given the fact that the number 1 engine GEN was offline. After discussing it, we could have done better by using that checklist. After review of the Drift down checklist, we determined that we covered all items in that checklist already via the "Engine Shut Down" checklist.Third, we did not verbalize the "Engine Limit/ Surge" memory items. The memory items were accomplished using the "Engine Shut Down" checklist vs the "Engine Limit" checklist.		Air carrier pilots reported the loss of oil quantity and pressure during cruise flight. The pilots stated they shut the engine down and diverted.

It didn't smell like anything burning or electrical and was at first barely noticeable.  At about the time we leveled at 13000 ft., it got stronger and we got a " SMOKE CREW REST F/D (Forward) " EICAS.  Soon after we could see smoke present under the overhead storm lights.  The smell got more intense and changed a bit but was still not what I would describe as a "burning" or electrical smell. I donned my O2 (Oxygen) mask and established crew communications.  The Captain told me to [request priority handling] and get as direct a routing to the final approach fix as possible.  I [advised ATC] that we had smoke in cockpit, asking for expedited routing.I looked up the EICAS warning in the FM (Flight Manual) and there is no procedure. The second Captain mentioned terrain avoidance about this time which was a good reminder given the area around ZZZZ. Since I didn't revisit the QRC and was busy with ATC, the other FO (First Officer) pulled the QRC and ran it. About the time we intercepted the localizer most of the smoke was gone.After clearing the runway, ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) inspected our exterior reporting that all appeared normal.  We proceeded uneventfully to the gate.		On descent into ZZZZ just prior to ZZZZZ at about 13000 ft.; SMOKE IN FWD (Forward) CREW REST EICAS message came on while establishing comm with the flight attendants we can hear the alarm in the back.  At that point we can smell and see smoke in the cockpit. Followed checklist put oxygen masks on and the relief Captain and FO (First Officer) ran more fumes checklist.  [We advised ATC] and received vectors to final Runway XL. While running the checklist smoke started to dissipate after turning IFE (In Flight Entertainment), BROAD BAND, and RECIRCULATE FANS off.  Kept speed up til final and flew normal approach and landing Runway XL. Crash Fire Rescue looked us over then we proceeded to the gate.		B777 flight crew reported smoke in the flight deck during arrival descent. Smoke dissipated during approach and flight landed safely.

Rejection was around 80 kias. Masks were donned during reject and cockpit visibility was very low. Just enough visibility to see a taxiway turnoff as I was slowing on the rejected takeoff. Tower reported smoke coming out of the left side then left engine of aircraft. As we cleared the runway cockpit windows were open to allow better visibility. I shut down the left engine as we cleared the Runway and slowly brought the aircraft to a full stop and set the parking brake. Coordination was done between myself and onsite fire coordinator on VHF1. The Fire Commander ensured me the engine was not on fire although smoke continued for at least 10-15 minutes. I'm assuming now it was because of the oil in the engine was thru out the engine because of a blown seal or bearing. During all of this the First Officer accomplished the rejected takeoff checklist. Right engine was also shut down. No APU was started. Even though only the APU air was deferred, I was now not confident in the analysis done by local contract Maintenance and thought it best practice to leave the aircraft shutdown. Local Maintenance had said before departure that they prefer we not run the APU because of the oil/smoke situation of the previous flight. In hindsight, I should have insisted the either it was inop or operating but not this in between.We passed to the company Chief Pilot and ops via cell phone that we would be losing radios in 10-15 minute and needed a tug. ATC was also informed via VHF. We were towed to site XXX. 2 deadheading pilots in the back of the plane confirmed that during the incident the back half of the cabin had almost no visibility because of smoke and the front half was also filled with smoke but better visibility. In the cockpit most of the smoke entered under the feet of myself and the First Officer. It took no more the 5-7 seconds for entire cockpit to be filled with smoke. 3rd and 4th pilots reported they could barely see the back our our heads,18 inches away, and  the instruments were not visible because of smoke during rejection.		Shortly after the start of takeoff roll, heavy smoke poured into the flight deck. Visibility was close to zero and a rejected takeoff occurred at approximately 80 knots. As the aircraft slowed, we donned our oxygen masks and the 2 relief pilots assisted in opening the windows to allow the smoke to dissipate. Tower was notified and we exited the Runway and requested fire fighting assistance. Tower then reported smoke coming from our left engine, so we immediately shut it down. We completed the rejected takeoff checklist and confirmed with the on scene commander there was no fire in either engine. The smoke started to dissipate so we elected not to evacuate and monitor the situation. After coordinating with ATC and company, we were towed to a hard stand. Maintenance discovered a major oil leak on the left engine.		B777 flight crew reported the cockpit filled with heavy smoke during takeoff roll. Flight crew rejected takeoff, cleared the runway, and was towed to ramp.

I was flying and saw the birds come out of the lower right to left. I did not hear any impact or notice anything abnormal upon their impact. After we completed our rotation I heard a buzzing sound with associated vibrations. I notified the Captain that we had hit birds as he didn't know what was causing the strange sound and vibrations. We noticed high vibrations on the #1 engine N1 (~5.5). The Captain notified Tower we needed to return to ZZZ due to a bird strike. We decided this would be the safest course of action. There were no ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) actions but we knew the airplane was damaged due to the higher than normal vibrations on the #1 engine and loud buzzing sound. The aircraft was climbing normally and producing normal thrust.I flew the airplane as the Captain ran the overweight landing checklist, notified the passengers, the flight attendants, Dispatch and ZZZ ops of our air return. The Captain then sent and received our flaps-full overweight landing aero data information. We then completed the approach checklist. As we were working through the above items we flew a right traffic pattern and visual approach to the longest Runway XYL from which we performed a smooth landing. After landing we selected the brake fans on and taxied using normal procedures to the gate. Mechanics came up to the flight deck and told us that both engines had received damage. We thought the #2 engine had not been damaged due to seemingly normal vibrations. The Captain wrote up the discrepancies for the bird strikes and overweight landing. There is really no way to avoid a bird strike at rotation. The best way to prevent future bird strikes would be to implement measures that keep birds away from the airport at ZZZ. I have also seen coyotes on the runways/taxiways at ZZZ. As far as this event goes I am happy with our performance implementing CRM and decision making resulting in the safe outcome of the flight.				A-320 First Officer reported a bird strike while rotating for takeoff and one engine displayed high vibrations and a buzzing sound. The aircraft safely returned to the departure field for an overweight landing. Post flight inspection revealed damage to both engines.

I can't remember if the controller on frequency gave us that clearance or if it was the previous Approach Controller. The FO (First Officer) believes it was the previous Controller. After a few minutes at 5,000 ft. the Approach with an accent asked what altitude we were at, and I replied 5,000 ft. The Approach Controller stated that the MVA for that sector was 5,200 ft. due to the terrain to the east of our position. I am unsure if we misunderstood the descent clearance from 6,000 ft. or if the descent clearance was actually down to 5,000 ft. versus 5,200 ft. Either way the FO and Captain are sure we read back 5,000 ft. The Controller on frequency had an accent that made them somewhat difficult to understand but it is quite possible that the previous Controller issued that descent instruction and the Controller on frequency was simply correcting the issue. Either way it appears we were 200 ft. low and below the MVA altitude for that sector.		To the best of my recollection, we were at 6,000 ft. given a descent clearance to 5,000 ft. and a heading of 200 from the initial Approach Controller. The Controller did respond with any different instructions. We were then handed off to the final Approach Controller. The final Controller asked what altitude we were at. PM stated 5,000 ft. Approach Controller responded with "you should be at 5,200 feet for the MVA due to terrain in the area". They then vectored us closer to the field to then join the Localizer for ILS Approach Runway XXR. The final Approach Controller had stated that it could have been a previous Controllers error, she did not give us a number to call.		An Air Carrier flight crew reported they descended below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude.

None of the SATCOM calls would go through. Each time the display would read SAT-1 /2 FAIL: CONNECTION. We did not get any EICAS for SATVOICE LOST on any of the attempted SATCOM calls.While the crew monitored the secondary engine display indications, right oil quantity continued to drop to 0. About 5 minutes after secondary engine display right oil quantity displayed 0, right engine oil pressure started decreasing. First indication, was the right engine oil pressure was 57 psi, while left engine oil pressure was 69 psi. The crew continued to try SATCOM calls to Dispatch and Maintenance Control while they tried to troubleshoot SATCOM with no indication of a malfunction displayed in the EICAS. The crew considered making a phone patch to Dispatch, but the crew could not find HF coverage of this area in the FOM.The crew started discussing divert options in this area. At this point the aircraft was approaching ZZZZ from the southeast. We had just passed a few countries, both which were declined by the crew as good options for a divert. We discussed pressing across [a body of water] to reach a more suitable divert closer to our destination with better security outlook, but with the engine oil pressure decreasing, we felt it was not the best option. We discussed possibly holding over ZZZZ. The crew also identified the potential requirement to jettison gas to normal landing weight prior to a divert into ZZZZ. The crew opened the Loss of Oil Pressure Right Non-normal Checklist to review it in case we had to perform a precautionary shutdown. In an attempt to maintain the right engine oil pressure as long as possible, the Captain elected to exercise Captain's authority and disconnected the right autothrottle and slightly reduced the power to see if the right engine oil pressure would stabilize and stop decreasing. The right engine oil pressure continued to decrease over a period of approximately 30 minutes from 57 psi to 52 psi to 44 psi to 40 psi to 34 psi to 25 psi to 19 psi. Each time the oil pressure would decrease, then stabilize and increase slightly for a couple minutes, then it would decrease again.The crew directed the Jumpseat Loadmaster to the back of the airplane to visually inspect the engine nacelle for visual evidence of the leak. He was not able to visually confirm evidence of an engine oil leak on the right engine. The Captain transferred aircraft control to me while she troubleshot the SATCOM radios, looked for HF phone patch options, and conducted the radio relay with Aircraft Y. After the crew attempted several more SATCOM calls, the crew contacted Aircraft Y that was slightly ahead of us on a similar route to request a relay to Dispatch via their SATCOM. Aircraft Y relayed our situation of loss of engine oil quantity and decreasing engine oil pressure on the right engine, and intentions to likely divert into ZZZZ to Dispatch, and solicited Dispatch recommendations. We received a response back from Aircraft Y that Dispatch's recommendation was also a divert to ZZZZ. By this point, the aircraft was beginning to coast out over the [body of water]. The crew decided to turn back for a divert into ZZZZ. The Captain had to [advise ATC] to ZZZZ in order to break into very busy radio chatter in order to get ZZZZ Control's attention and receive priority handling.Once the crew turned back toward ZZZZ, ATC cleared them direct to ZZZ [VOR]. With the FO (First Officer) as the pilot flying and the Captain pilot monitoring and the right engine oil pressure in the yellow at 19 - 17 psi, the crew performed the Loss of Oil Pressure Right Checklist as a precautionary shutdown even though there was no EICAS warning. The crew completed the checklist and executed the VNAV Engine Out page and requested a drift-down descent to FL240. The crew also diverted the FMS to ZZZZ.The crew set up the aircraft to jettison fuel to the normal landing weight, approximately 23 - 25K, and received approval from ZZZZ to jettison fuel from ZZZ1 [VOR]. ATC then changed the approval to jettison fuel from ZZZ [VOR] at approximately FL220. The fuel dumping took about 5 - 6 minutes, and the crew completed the Fuel Jettison Checklist.The Captain requested vectors for the ILS XXC at ZZZZ, and we were told to expect that. ATC at ZZZZ responded that we would be given vectors for ILS XXL. The Captain set up the FMS, briefed the approach, and flaps 20 autoland for ILS XXL at ZZZZ. The Captain briefed via the QRH, including the non-normal landing data. While on vectors, the Captain [requested priority handling] and requested fire truck support on landing. The Captain took the controls back and flew the vectors for the ILS XXL approach. The crew received numerous heading changes and step-downs during vectors for the approach. The crew completed the Approach, and Before Landing Checklists while on vectors.The Captain executed an uneventful single-engine autoland to Runway XXL at ZZZZ. The wind was 280 at 9 kt. on landing. The Captain cleared the runway at high speed Taxiway 1. After the uneventful landing and roll-out, taxied to the assigned Gate XX. After the crew shut down the remaining engine at the gate and opened the crew door, chaos ensued with [people] and representatives asking numerous questions ranging from what happened and why we were there to what kind of cargo we were carrying. The Captain got on the phone with the Duty Officer to let the company know what had happened since we're unable to make contact via SATCOM, which still was not working on the ground. The Captain was giving the DO (Duty Officer) a situational report as well as determining our reporting requirements.Someone from the ground personnel requested that a crewmember come outside to look at the main gear. Upon arriving at the left main gear, the #5 main gear was smoking. I immediately cleared the area to the side of the gear and requested the authorities contact the fire trucks to respond. I directed that the Fire Department set up cooling fans on the smoking gear. As I went down to find the #5 brake was smoking, the EICAS for brake temperatures annunciated in the flight deck. The Captain sent a representative down to ensure everyone was clear of the hot brakes. The Captain came down, while on the phone with the DO, to check that aircraft was chocked so she could release the brakes. The Fire Department asked us if they could put water on the brakes to cool them. After consulting with Maintenance Control to confirm, we communicated that was not advisable. Two cooling fans were focused on the hot brakes, but the fuse plug melted on #5.The questions from the authorities continued with significant language barriers, i.e., the meaning of corrosive and hazardous cargo, as well as requests for overfly permits, cargo airbills, etc. Calls continued to the DO, Dispatch, and Maintenance Control as we waited for the brakes to cool. Upon completion of answering most of the questions, the Captain powered down the airplane and we deplaned approximately 3 hours after landing. The crew went through Immigration, Customs, and out to the hotel. We met the Company Representative at the hotel. Crew debriefed after checking into the hotel.Cause: The malfunction was a mechanical failure, but both the Captain and I were fatigued due to trip revisions and swapping from night schedule to day schedule with two back-to-back min crew rest periods prior to the flight.Suggestions: The mechanical issue may or may not be preventable based upon what is determined to be the cause of the oil leak. The eventual outcome of a successful divert and single-engine landing was due to experienced pilots working together as team to bring the airplane in safely. Good crew coordination skills and training helped bring a successful result. Malfunctions like this without the ability to coordinate with Dispatch due to communication failure of the SATCOM require the teamwork of two experienced pilots to bring it to a successful conclusion.		Aircraft right engine oil showing 0 and pressure was decreasing. Crew [advised ATC] but did not take priority. Dumped 25K of fuel... diverted to ZZZZ. I was advised by the crew that [they advised ATC] and dumped fuel only after landing when Captain called Maintenance Control first.		B777 flight crew and Dispatcher reported failure of the SATCOM system and loss of engine oil quantity resulted in a diversion.

We planned for a normal landing flaps 30 and auto brakes 3 since the wind was 070/05 due to a slight 1 knot tailwind after doing a landing assessment. It was a normal touchdown; 7 seconds after crossing the threshold, smooth touchdown. After touchdown I opened the thrust reversers and noticed that the auto brakes were not working. I applied smooth pressure on the brake pedals to stop the aircraft and realized I had no brakes. The Captain took control of the aircraft at that point and realized his brakes were not working as well. At that point he went into full reverse thrust. We were near high speed taxiway and the aircraft was still slowing down. At that point I called the tower and [requested priority handling] and told them we had lost brakes system on the aircraft. We were able to stop the aircraft within the runway safety area of XXL beyond the runway landing threshold lights. I really don't know what we could have done differently.		FO (First Officer) was the pilot in command performing what at the moment was a normal landing using runway XXL at ZZZ. After the nose wheel touched down, the captain took over the control of the aircraft and noticed that the brakes were not working.  He stated that there was no non-normal indications. He said hydraulic pressure was normal. He had to use both thrust reversers to stop. The aircraft came to a final stop at runway XXL's overrun area.		Air carrier flight crew reported complete loss of aircraft brake system during landing rollout. Aircraft was stopped using reverse thrust only.

No convective activity was present, and it was a relatively clear evening. I was the Pilot Flying. Our flight plan called for an initial cruise at FL310 until ZZZ VOR and then a climb to FL370. The first third of the flight was relatively uneventful with the ride fluctuating from smooth to light chop. During this time our Flight Attendants were able to perform their service, while the seat belt sign remained on to keep the isle clear. As we approached ZZZ, ZZZ3 was indicating turbulence (light to moderate chop) from FL250 up to and including FL370. Due to the aircraft weight and other pilot reports, the Captain and I elected to descend to FL250. After leveling, the ride still consisted of light chop, and we advised the Passengers and Flight Attendants to remain seated. Nine minutes after level off, the aircraft abruptly experienced large pitch and attitude changes resulting in the immediate disengagement of the autopilot. The ride was so rough that I found it difficult to focus on the instruments and it was a continuous battle to keep the wings level and keep the aircraft from over speeding. The Captain requested lower and the turbulence did not let up until passing FL230. We leveled at FL190 and began to assess the situation. We were informed by our Cabin Crew that our B Flight Attendant was injured, as she was standing at the time of the incident but was stable. The D Flight Attendant stated that a Paramedic, and possibly a Nurse, was providing care but did not feel her condition warranted a diversion. We contacted medical services through the Company, and they agreed to have Paramedics meet her at the gate in ZZZ2. I want to applaud the Cabin Crew as they performed wonderfully following the event. They provided the Flight Crew with good information and remained calm and collected. The rest of the flight was to ZZZ2 was uneventful. Just a reminder to the flight attendants that if they are briefed to remain seated to continue to do so until after they have been given the all clear.				B-737 First Officer reported severe turbulence during cruise resulting in an altitude excursion and near over speed. A Flight Attendant in the cabin was injured during the turbulence and the flight continued to destination.

Concurrently, we encountered unusually strong wake turbulence lasting for several minutes. Two to three miles prior to CHAVO intersection, we noticed the aircraft was not leveling off at the 9000 foot crossing restriction. We then noticed the aircraft was in OPEN DESCENT. I immediately corrected back to the appropriate altitude. During the correction, we dipped approximately 400 feet below the appropriate altitude. This altitude diversion did not cause any conflict with any other traffic and ATC did not mention the deviation				A330 Captain reported descending below an altitude restriction on descent into PHX after encountering wake turbulence.

As we were climbing we received a TA, as I acquired the aircraft I realized it was going to result in a RA. I told the First Officer( we are going to have a RA, level out. or something to that effect) As he started to respond the RA began. I think it was initially a level out. I noticed that the other aircraft started to descend, and I think I verbalized that. We then got a descend RA. About that time the other aircraft turned towards us and started diving through our altitude towards us. It's hard to recollect what occurred but both the FO (First Officer) and I were 'in the fight' at that point to ensure he didn't hit us. we took aggressive maneuvering action to avoid a collision. We did get a bank angle warning, but no overspeed or under speed warnings. After avoiding the aircraft we returned to our heading and began the climb again. We advised ATC that we had multiple RA's and had to take evasive maneuvers. I think the vectoring from ATC, and the action of the other pilot turning towards us and dive through our altitude are the largest factors. One additional items that I am considering. The After Takeoff Flow in manual the trigger is 'after flap and slat retraction' during this event most of my time until the TA occurred was me waiting for the flaps to retract before beginning my after takeoff flow. I understand the rationale of wanting to ensure if the flaps fail to retract that is caught. I think more time available to scan for traffic is a higher importance. Suggestion: Better airspace management. On a side note. there was no support for the Flight Attendants. I had to personally walk the Flight Attendants down to the flight office, engage with their management. I also found it troubling that after a traumatic event for them the company was taking statements with out any representation besides myself. I'm not sure what the reason for taking statements while flight attendants were crying is, but it seemed like this was more focused on should they be payed for the trip removal then their fitness for duty. The flight attendants were expected to fly to ZZZ1 two hours after we landed until I got involved.				B737-800 Captain reported a NMAC with another aircraft during departure climbout.

We therefore prioritized getting on the ground as soon as possible.The cabin crew reported that the row XX overhead bin was still hot, but the burning plastic odor had decreased. However, they received conflicting reports from customers who claimed that they felt heat coming from underneath. I checked the cargo smoke panel and verified that the smoke lights were not illuminated. ATC cleared us for the visual XXR. The touchdown was normal and under max landing weight. The burnt plastic odor continued to persist during the decent and landing.After touchdown, I applied max manual braking and set the parking brake to ON after coming to a complete stop. The cabin crew reported that the hot overhead bin had cooled off, but the burnt plastic smell persisted. An evacuation was not warranted; therefore we proceeded to taxi to the gate.Nearing the gate, the odor on the flight deck had mostly dissipated. One of the first persons to board the aircraft was a security inspector. She detected the residual burnt plastic odor, starting on the flight deck to row XX. She did not detect the odor beyond row XX. She performed a quick search of the bags in the overhead bin of row XX, but found no indications of fire or heat damage to neither bags or bin.The burnt plastic odor discrepancy was documented into the aircraft's maintenance log. The odor was described to assist tech ops in troubleshooting. The FO and I declared ourselves fatigued. During the de-brief with the cabin crew, it appeared that the burning plastic odor decreased after the flight attendant had de-selected the IFE (In-flight entertainment)/ PED (Personal Electronic Device) system.				Air carrier Captain reported a burning plastic odor during descent with no aircraft indications. The flight crew diverted where a safe landing was completed.

I was the flying pilot. I spooled the throttles to approximately 40% N1 per procedure, verified N1s were matched, then announced and engaged TO/GA when a split in the throttles was immediately felt, followed by a red auto throttles (A/T) fail light. We rejected the takeoff and advised ATC. This all happened prior to reaching 10 knots. We pulled off the runway after informing Tower of the rejected takeoff, sat for several minutes and ran through the appropriate checklist, channels, etc, and elected to attempt a second takeoff. The same issue happened on the second takeoff attempt (under 10 knots), we rejected, advised ATC, and returned to gate and were met by maintenance. The mechanics found faults with the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) and ASM which warranted an MEL deferral of the autothrottle system. After a delay we headed back out for takeoff with no autothrottles and were cleared for takeoff once again. Immediately after lift off, we lost all lateral and vertical navigation symbology on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and the Mode Control Panel (MCP). A [request for priority handling] was declared on initial check in with the Departure Controller where we requested and received runway heading and a level off-altitude right away from ATC. I hand flew the airplane using raw data for a few minutes with some navigation sources eventually coming back online, but were unsure if the sources were reliable. The autopilot was eventually reengaged successfully and I monitored the progress while guarding the flight controls and manually manipulating thrust as needed. We then ran through appropriate checklists, protocols, and procedures and had to make an overweight [priority handling] landing and requested for Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to be present. We set up for a long final to XXC at ZZZ with the help of ATC. I performed the landing and rollout which was uneventful. We pulled off the runway to a complete stop and had ARFF inspect the exterior of the aircraft including the gear and brakes before continuing taxiing to the gate. Maintenance met us at the gate once again advised they would be removing the aircraft from service.		After losing both lateral and vertical guidance we [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ. Overweight landing was performed. Cause: Guidance System malfunction.		B-737 air carrier crew reported an initial rejected takeoff due to faulty auto throttle system then a subsequent departure with loss of lateral and vertical guidance information on the aircraft PFD and MCP flight instruments after takeoff. The crew returned to the departure airport and landed safely overweight.

During climbout from ZZZZ, passing approximately 4,000 feet, multiple electrical sparks, a popping sound, and white smoke starting coming from underneath and on the left side of the glare shield panel, approximately where the PTT (push to talk) MIC button is located. I announced "FIRE" to the First Officer, ensured that he was flying the aircraft, and then decided we need to immediately return back to ZZZZ. I asked the First Officer to level off at 5,000 feet, I [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Tower, advised them we had a fire onboard, and needed an immediate return to Runway X at ZZZZ. We donned oxygen masks, I established communication with the First Officer, and began to run the Smoke, Fire, or Fumes QRC and QRH. Due to time constraints, priority was given to notifying dispatch, having the Flight Attendants prepare for a precautionary landing back at ZZZZ, and making an announcement to the passengers. I then briefly looked at the Overweight Landing checklist and considerations, and began to setup for the ILS X approach back into ZZZZ. The First Officer had everything set up and had checked the performance charts regarding the overweight landing. We agreed we would land, stop on the runway, and have CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) inspect the airplane, especially the landing gear and brakes. The First Officer made a routine and normal landing with flaps 30, Autobrakes 3, at approximately 166,200 pounds. Once we were stopped and the parking brake was set, I lowered the flaps to 40, stowed the speed brakes, and made the announcement to "REMAIN SEATED". CFR inspected the airplane, didn't notice any anomalies, and cleared us to taxi to the gate at Stand 1. We ensured that the CFR vehicles followed us to the gate to keep watch on the brakes and landing gear.Cause: L1 forward window was recently replaced. Maintenance technician discovered burnt and chaffed wiring to the L1 Window Heat under the glareshield upon further investigation.		I was PF (pilot flying) and still hand flying. Aircraft was clean and flown at up bug for terrain considerations. Climbing thru 4000 the Captain noticed sparks and smoke from under left side of glare shield. He called it out and said we need to return. Oxygen masks were donned and communication established. ATC advised with a [request for priority handling]. I engaged Autopilot selected V/S and reset MCP (Mode Control Panel) altitude to 5000, with weather being VMC and us turning away from terrain.. Captain advised ATC we were turning downwind for approach X and started checklist. Right after smoke was noticed we also noticed master caution and anti-ice with window overheat on L1 window. Abeam or slightly after abeam the field, flaps selected to 1 then 5. I extracted landing distance from AOM while Captain continued checklist. I adviced ATC of the need for ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) vehicles. We briefly discussed the need to look at brake cooling schedule and advice ARFF to inspect aircraft and wheels/brakes and then follow us to the remote stand. Approach preparations for ILS was accomplished on base leg now descending to 3000 ft. ATC cleared us to intercept from a 085 heading and approach was accomplished with Flaps 30 and Autobrakes 3 with weight approximately 167200 lbs. Full reversed used after normal landing and aircraft brought to a stop just short of Taxiway 1 where ARFF vehicles were standing by. Captain informed passengers to remain seated, we lowered flaps to 40. After short inspection they followed us to remote parking stand. Operations was adviced to inform ground crew not to approach main gear and only chock the nose gear.Cause: L1 window heat wiring found chaffed and burnt by mechanic during investigation after parking.Solution: Re-evaluate wiring installation for window heat. L1 Window was replaced two days ago.		B-737-800 air carrier crew reported cockpit smoke from the area around a flight deck window during climb. The crew returned safely to the departure airport and landed safely overweight.

After landing we stopped on the runway and had the Landing gear pinned. We were then towed to the gate.Cause: Rupture in the hydraulic system.Suggestion: When the fluid decreased to 19%, I expected a Total Loss of system A. The standpipe in the system kept enough fluid to maintain some system pressure. I believe the checklist should state this in someway.				B737-800 Captain reported they received a hydraulic low pressure light during cruise in System A prompting the crew to divert.

We departed ZZZ at XA:25 on a rescheduled delayed departure flight to ZZZZ. There were four pilots on the augmented flight. During engine start we got a Configuration Gear, TO configuration flaps EICAS during engine start. After about :10 seconds the EICAS went away. The relief pilot said he had seen a EPR spike during start and we concluded that the EPR spike had been a glitch and set off the EICAS to think we had applied takeoff power. Systems returned to normal and we continued.The departure was normal and uneventful. I was pilot flying and we used Runway XX with a slight tailing crosswind. During climb on the ZZZZZ2 departure we were turned to the north. As I had flaps retracted and accelerated I noticed a EICAS THRUST ASSYMETRY TAC. I pointed to the EICAS and continued climbing as I directed the FO (First Officer) to complete after takeoff checklist and run the checklist for the TAC (Thrust Asymmetry Compensation). At that point we noticed a red box around EGT on right engine. The engine was operating normally at that time but was about 70 degrees higher than the left engine. The red box showed we had a EGT limit during the climb. We continued climing to a safe altitude and requested a level off at 14000 and a vector clear of traffic as we worked a checklist. While ATC vectored us around traffic we got another EICAS Eng EEC (Electronic Engine Control) Mode R.The checklists had us reset the EEC switches to ALT. The relief pilot mentioned that the Eng Lin/Surge/Stall u checklist would be appropriate as we had a indication expedience. We reviewed that checklist and concluded the engine was stabilized.At this point after crew discussions and completing the tasks on the checklists I made the decision that we should return to ZZZ and land. We had stayed within 30-35 miles from ZZZ as we worked the situation. We contacted dispatch on Satcom and patched to Maintenancel. A discussion of all the faults and situation concluded in agreement with ZZZ landing as safest plan. I discussed with Maintenance that I would rather not dump fuel and if we could safely land overweight we would do that. We had Dispatch send the performance data to conclude that a safe 30 degree landing could be made on Runway XXC at ZZZ and also ensure a single engine go around with performance if it was needed. Our weight allowed this and we briefed Runway XXC, for ILS approach. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested clearance to Runway XXC.After a briefing we were vectored to join Runway XXC. I slowed the aircraft early and configured to ensure limits and speeds were safe. A heavy landing has some differences and handling is challenging. I used Autobrake 2 and Flap 30 to decrease stress on the aircraft. The landing was normal landing and I gently applied brakes and we were able to exit normally only about 2/3 of the runway. Fire crews inspected the plane and we continued to the gate.				B-777 Captain reported after takeoff an engine showed an EGT exceedance. The pilots returned to the departure station.

A few minutes later I looked down and noticed we were losing fuel rapidly out of the right tank. The imbalance was now 2000 pounds and increasing. I pointed it out to the captain who was Pilot Monitoring (PM). He [requested priority], notified dispatch via code on ACARS and started to run checklists. While he did that I turned us back to ZZZ and setup for the approach. During this we had the Flight Attendants (FAs) look out the right wing to see if they saw us loosing fuel. The Captain (CA) also briefed them on the return and that it would be a precautionary landing. The checklist had us shutdown the number 2 engine. The Captain shutdown the engine and I continued us toward ZZZ for an approach to Runway XXR. We had an uneventful single engine approach and landing. Clearing the runway emergency vehicles looked and didn't see any fuel leaking. We returned to the gate and gave the aircraft to Maintenance.				Air carrier First Officer reported during climbout the fuel quantity system began to show an increasing imbalance between tanks. The pilot returned to the departure station.

The airplane used was Aircraft X, a B777-200. After climbing to our cruising altitude of FL370 and approximately one hour into the flight, while the Relief Pilot was on break, the Captain and I noticed the forward left windshield was arcing in the lower right corner. We watched for approximately 45 seconds as the arc moved from the lower right corner, up and diagonally to the middle of the windshield. Shortly after the arc ceased, we heard a loud pop and watched as the windshield began to shatter. We were not aware which layer/pane failed.At this time, EICAS messages began to appear on the upper EICAS screen and I stated 'My aircraft' and continued to fly the airplane while the Captain completed the checklists. The Window Heat L and the Window Damage FWD L messages appeared and he accomplished both checklists in accordance with Company standard operating procedures.Once the checklists were complete, we began a discussion on the need to divert and we requested the Relief Pilot return to the flight deck to help with coordination and workload management.At this point we utilized HF radio [requested priority handling] to ZZZ and CPDLC technology alerting them of our need to divert off of our assigned track. In accordance with oceanic procedures, we turned on all exterior lighting, transmitted our intentions on both and turned to begin our divert.There was a discussion about retuning to ZZZ or diverting to ZZZ1. We decided ZZZ1 would be the best option due to the forecast weather deteriorating in ZZZ. At this time, we also overheard reports of severe turbulence in the ZZZ area, so ZZZ1 made the most sense considering the situation.We were able to coordinate a descent to FL250 and requested speed at our discretion. That was approved and we descended and slowed to 280 kts. We had some time and referenced the QRH for any supplemental information that might be pertinent to our situation.We requested ZZZ1 weather and briefed an ILS XXL approach into ZZZ1. The winds were reported to be 230/23G38.Approximately 100 miles east of ZZZ1, we accomplished the descent checklist and descended to 11,000 feet and slowed to 250 kts in preparation for the arrival and landing. As a precaution, we also requested Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARF) be available on landing.I flew the approach and landing and it was normal. We taxied off of Runway XXL under our own power and subsequently parked at gate 1.I appreciate working with the FO's. At all times, they were professional and efficient in their communication. They, along with the flight attendants, did a fantastic job that contributed to a successful diversion. It should be noted that the Captain's forward windshield had been written up a week prior on Day 0 for de-laminating all corners and the Maintenance Discrepancy was put on. There was also an info to maintenance item on Day 1 of the left window heat needing to be reset prior to departure and then again in flight. Additionally, there was a separate info item to maintenance on Day 2 4 for 'EICAS window heat R side.'A thorough review and potential streamlining of the deferral process especially in instances with multiple and common write ups. A requirement to shorten deferral times in order to fix issues.		After leveling off at a cruising altitude of FL370 about one hour into the flight the Captain's forward windshield indicated electrical arcing in the lower right corner. This was immediately followed by a loud pop and subsequent shattering of one of the layers of the Captain's windshield. The Window Heat L and Window Damage FWD L checklist were completed and it was determined a divert was necessary. At this point via HF to ZZZ we [requested priority handling] to coordinate a divert to ZZZ1. ZZZ was considered, but a strong frontal boundary was already causing severe turbulence at 6000 ft in the ZZZ area (reported by a 737) which made ZZZ1 a better choice and a closer suitable airport. A descent off track was coordinated via HF and CPDLC to FL250 speed at our discretion with ZZZ Oceanic. Approximately 75 miles from ZZZ1 we descended to 11,000 250 kts. The First Officer (FO) landed uneventfully to Runway XXL ZZZ1 winds were 230@23 gust to 38. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARF) had been notified and were available upon landing. We taxied to gate 1 without incident.It should be noted the Captain's FWD windshield had a write-up on Day 0 for delamination and a Maintenance Discrepancy was issued. Also on Day 1 an info to maintenance report of the L window heat being reset just prior to departure and again in-flight.Differing the maintenance of the FWD L windshield delamination along with the FWD L windshield heat having a write-up with no action was the causal factor. The aircraft sat a ZZZ for 24 hours prior to this flight with adequate time to replace the FWD L windshield. If this was done it would have prevented the issue and diversion.		B777 flight crew reported the Captain's forward window shattered at FL370. The flight returned to the mainland.

We then [requested priority], and diverted to ZZZ. We also reviewed the loss of System A checklist. Upon landing, we stopped on the runway and Maintenance pinned the gear. We were then towed to the gate.Cause: Failure of the engine driven pump which caused a leak. Fluid was seen on rather #1 engine.Suggestion: I suggest that the checklist should have you check/monitor the fluid quantity following a low pressure light, to identify if fluid is leaking from the system.				An air carrier First Officer reported they diverted due to a hydraulic pump failure resulting in loss of hydraulic fluid.

The First Officer (FO) display and indications were normal. Both sides did not show any indications of a problem for about five minutes. Then the airspeed disagree and altitude disagree indications appeared. The Captain's airspeed, altitude, and VSI began to fluctuate. Captain completed the Airspeed Unreliable checklist and we determined that the FO's side and the standby instruments were in sync and the Captain transferred Pilot Flying responsibilities to the FO. Pilots completed the QRH for airspeed unreliable. [Requested priority] and diverted to ZZZ.		Just after level off at FL390, Captain airspeed indicator showed an overspeed and an airspeed disagree that only lasted for about five seconds. First Officer (FO) indications were normal.

Decided on a single-engine taxi. The #1 Engine was started after making the turn onto Taxiway 1. As we approached the runway, ZZZ Tower cleared us for takeoff. The two-minute warmup expired as we crossed the hold short line. Advanced the thrust levers and started to accelerate. Somewhere between 80 knots and 100 knots we started to feel a shimmy from what was assumed to be an unbalanced nosewheel--not uncommon.Over the next few seconds, the shimmy turned much more pronounced. At that point between 111 and 115 knots, the Captain decided to reject the takeoff. We rejected according to procedure, the First Officer executed his duties perfectly, and the aircraft came to a stop on the autobrakes. The Captain told the Passengers to remain seated over the PA. We set the flaps to 40 and retracted the speedbrakes.We informed the Tower of the reject and suspected tire damage. During the reject the Captain noticed a large dark object fly out in front of the aircraft and go into the grass. Airport Operations evidently found a large piece of the tire in the grass. We asked the Tower if they saw any smoke or fire, as we had no abnormal engine indications nor smoke fumes or smells in the cabin. The Tower took a closer look and said there was a little bit of smoke coming from the main gear. They called out the fire trucks and an Airport Operations vehicle was first on scene. We switched to a discreet frequency, and they informed us that indeed we had lost the left main inboard tire.At this point the fire trucks showed up and we started the APU and shutdown the engines. At this point we turned off the autobrakes and set the parking brake due to the fact that we were on a down-sloped runway and no one had any chocks. The Captain called back to the Flight Attendants to ensure that they as well as the Passengers were okay.We called ZZZ Operations and told them of the rejected takeoff and they said Maintenance is on XXX.XX nothing else. We assumed that they would call Dispatch to let them know what was going on. We put a call into ZZZ Maintenance to explain what happened. We ran the brake cooling data, and it said do not approach the gear for 30 minutes to one hour, at gate inspection needed, and 34.8M ft/lb.About 25 minutes since the reject, Maintenance showed up and informed us that they were going to replace both tires and then let us taxi to the gate. We believed towing us to the gate would be a safer option as we didn't know if there was any damage to either engine even though we had no abnormal indications. There was some confusion about where Airport Operations would meet the Super Tug but eventually it showed up.When they tried to move the aircraft, evidently the brakes on the right side had seized up. Maintenance started to work on the brakes, and the Captain discussed with Airport Operations about getting airstairs and buses to get everyone off the aircraft and back to the terminal. During this entire event, The Captain talked to the Flight Attendants and Passengers letting them know what was going on. Side note, we did get some messages from Dispatch; but because there was no chime to alert us, we overlooked them until a bit later. We kept the Passengers seated but let the Flight Attendants know that if anyone needed to use the facilities it was okay. At about the two-hour mark from leaving the gate, airstairs and buses arrived and we started deplaning. They unloaded the baggage and we rode the aircraft to the hangar.		We departed the gate uneventfully. Decided on a single-engine taxi. The #1 Engine was started after making the turn onto Taxiway 1. As we approached the runway, ZZZ Tower cleared us for takeoff. The two-minute warmup expired as we crossed the hold short line. Advanced the thrust levers and started to accelerate. Somewhere between 80 knots and 100 knots we started to feel a shimmy from what I assumed an unbalanced nosewheel--not uncommon.Over the next few seconds, the shimmy turned much more pronounced. At that point between 111 and 115 knots, I decided to reject the takeoff. We rejected according to procedure, the First Officer executed his duties perfectly, and the aircraft came to a stop on the autobrakes. I told the Passengers to remain seated over the PA. We set the flaps to 40 and retracted the speedbrakes.We informed the Tower of the reject and suspected tire damage. During the reject I noticed a large dark object fly out in front of the aircraft and go into the grass. Airport Operations evidently found a large piece of the tire around, I think they said, about a hundred yards out in the grass. We asked the Tower if they saw any smoke or fire, as we had no abnormal engine indications nor smoke fumes or smells in the cabin. The Tower took a closer look and said there was a little bit of smoke coming from the main gear. They called out the fire trucks and an Airport Operations vehicle was first on scene. We switched to a discreet frequency, and they informed us that indeed we had lost the left main inboard tire.At this point the fire trucks showed up and we started the APU and shutdown the engines. At this point we turned off the autobrakes and set the parking brake due to the fact that we were on a down-sloped runway and no one had any chocks. I called back to the Flight Attendants to ensure that they as well as the Passengers were okay.We called ZZZ Operations and told them of the rejected takeoff and they said Maintenance is on XXX.XX nothing else. I assumed that they would call Dispatch to let them know what was going on. We put a call into ZZZ Maintenance to explain what happened. We ran the brake cooling data, and it said do not approach the gear for 30 minutes to one hour, at gate inspection needed, and 34.8M ft/lb.About 25 minutes since the reject, Maintenance showed up and informed us that they were going to replace both tires and then let us taxi to the gate. We believed towing us to the gate would be a safer option as we didn't know if there was any damage to either engine even though we had no abnormal indications.

Air carrier flight crew reported a main gear tire failed during takeoff roll, resulting in a rejected takeoff. Passengers were deplaned and the aircraft towed to the hangar.

The flight was routine throughout, the only unusual occurrence being we were assigned our slowest practical speed 300 miles out, due to holding in ZZZ. We noted that that was unusual, since the ATIS was few at 2000, 5000 broken, 9000 overcast, winds 150 at 6, 10 miles visibility. There was light rain reported in the ATIS, and a comment of rain showers distant southeast & south. Not an ATIS that would immediately cause one to think the airport was in holding. We asked the last ZZZ Center controller prior to being handed off to Approach Control why they were holding, and he said there was rain 50 miles west of ZZZ. Again, rain 50 miles away seemed not a huge impact, but I thought "must be interfering with arrivals from the west, so they are slowing everyone down". Made sense to me. Our assigned STAR was the ZZZZZX, and aside from being assigned a speed of 190 for the entire arrival, the STAR was flown uneventfully as published. When we were at position ZZZZZ1, straight south of the field, the FO commented that he could easily see the airport. We received vectors for a base turn, and the Approach Controller asked if we could see the runway. We both agreed that we could see it, the PAPI and approach lights were clearly visible, and could remain VFR easily all the way to it, so reported we did, in fact, have the runway in sight. The controller cleared us for a visual approach, and assigned us to change over to Tower at approximately position ZZZZZ2. In light of the ATIS, I had the radar on until about the base turn, but since we could see the entire airport, it seemed unnecessary for the approach, and I re-selected the terrain display due to terrain considerations in the event of a missed approach. So far, everything was completely normal and unremarkable. I disconnected the Autopilot at about 4500 AGL. Unfortunately, I don't recall if I had the Autothrottles (AT) engaged or not. The approach progressed completely normally throughout. On final approach, our entire runway, the parallel Runway XL, the terminal - all were completely visible. Everything seemed utterly normal. As we approached the FAF ZZZZZ3, I noticed there was a bit of a fuzzy characteristic to the PAPI and threshold lights, but they remained clearly visible. At no time did the Approach or Tower Controller make any comment about rain or a shower at the runway. The only information we had was the ATIS report of light rain.At approximately 300 feet, a few raindrops began to appear on the windshield. The First Officer said let him know if I wanted wipers. Within a couple of seconds, the rain intensified, and I called for wipers. What happened next was utterly unbelievable. At maybe 120 feet, the rain became a deluge! Water was sheeting up the window, and the wipers were overwhelmed. At maybe 80 feet, I completely lost any depth perception due to the sheets of water rising up the window! I tried to jump back into the HUD guidance, but I was not expecting to need it, as I would in a CAT III situation.There was a total loss of useful visual reference for maybe 4 seconds, but they were, quite literally, the MOST impactful 4 seconds of the flight! We made quite a firm touchdown, had a minor bounce, and then were on the runway and into reverse. It was the worst landing I've ever made in my 3000+ hours on the 73. Being unsure of the status of the auto throttles at this point becomes very consequential. In training, and in the AOM, we discuss the exact scenario where a firm touchdown occurs with the thrust levers not fully at idle, then a bounce, which spins the main wheels up, then retarding the levers to idle, which deploys the ground spoilers, and the classic tail strike occurs. I think that is exactly what happened on this landing - irrespective of the status of the AT engagement, I think the thrust levers did not reach the idle detent in time for the touchdown.During the taxi in, the FO and I discussed whether or not I should make a logbook entry for a hard landing. He said in his previous airline, as a 737 check airman, he had witnessed harder landings than that, and they had always turned out to be, after downloading the FMCS data, well within the limits of the aircraft. I debated with myself about whether or not to make that log entry, but we were on a re-assignment status, with a plane full of passengers and crew already boarded at the next gate over awaiting us pilots. In the subsequent hair-on-fire preparation for that next flight, the consideration of the log entry for that landing was temporarily shuffled to secondary importance.Once we were in the climbout on the next flight, shortly after transition altitude, I looked up the exact verbiage in the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook). It says 'if the pilot believes a hard landing may have occurred, an entry in the AML is required'. Just under that, it discusses thrust need not be added for a 'shallow bounce or skip'. That was our situation on that prior landing, so I felt I had complied appropriately with that guidance. The AML entry, however, I decided needed to be made. I began to compose a message to dispatch requesting the Maintenance team in ZZZ create a logbook deferral sheet item referencing the possible hard landing. Before I completed it however, I checked the routing of the aircraft, and was dismayed to see it was already off the gate and underway on a flight to ZZZ2. I was frankly unsure what to do next. In retrospect, I SHOULD have sent the message to Dispatch, to comply with FOM. Perhaps Maintenance could have arranged for the inspection at ZZZ2. We arrived ZZZ3 45 minutes late, then had an extended wait for ground transportation, and I finally stepped into the hotel room at XA:20, after expecting to be laying over in ZZZ at XR:00 the night before. I was chilled, exhausted, and feeling quite low about my horrible landing, and simply was out of gas for any further action at that point. After arising mid-morning, while getting ready to get on the deadhead flight, I checked the logbook for any issues with the aircraft. None were made, and the it had flown 4 segments, so I assumed all must be OK. I was lulled into the comfort zone of prior discussions about hard landings, both with my current FO and in previous instances of training and conversation, and the fact that most pilot perceived hard landings are, in fact, well within Boeing design limits.After landing from the deadhead segment from ZZZ3 back to ZZZ, I checked the logbook once again, and was sickened to see a logbook deferral sheet item, describing delamination and burn marks forward of the tail skid. I'm pretty certain that is the result of this incident on my flight. At least the aircraft had now been evaluated by Maintenance, and since it has continued operating, it must be within maintenance limits. Nevertheless, I feel absolutely SICK to have been the one to cause ANY level of damage to a company aircraft. I also acknowledge that, due to being well and truly tired, I failed to comply with the FOM reporting requirements.Unforecast and unreported extreme rain shaft at THE worst possible location for our approach.Suggestions: The point I want to reiterate is how completely unexpected the situation was that resulted in this irregular landing. The visual sight picture, the mild ATIS, zero commentary from ATC or other aircraft, all led both of us to believe we were on a completely normal approach. The speed at which the precipitation went from a few drops to overwhelming the wipers and causing total loss of depth perception, at literally a second or two before the flare, was unbelievable. Despite my best efforts to salvage the situation, I ended up with the undesirable aircraft state. The old adage, EVERY approach may end up as a missed approach, certainly is reinforced here. Despite having made thousands of them, the one thousand and first may be the one that bites you, and this one was mine.		Below 100 ft and just prior to touchdown on Runway XR a sudden water curtain came to us and diminished our visibility even with the with the windshield wipers in high, that caused to lost deep perception of the runway for a few seconds and we touched firmly with a little bounce.Suggestions: Quicker updates on weather by ATC or PIREPS to warn off the last minute adverse conditions.		B737-800 flight crew reported heavy rain during landing flare resulting in bounced landing and tail strike.

An aircraft was told line up and wait on XY. As an aircraft passed by us landing on XX, we were cleared to line up and wait on XX, 'do not plan on stopping on the Runway', Tower Controller then gave landing aircraft exiting instructions, and then gave take off clearance to the aircraft on XY. Tower Controller then slowly gave us clearance for takeoff with a heading to fly and wind in a slightly slower than normal methodical cadence to allow the XY departing aircraft acceleration spacing. This is totally normal at this airport. As this was happening, we were focused on aligning with the Runway, the XY departing traffic and the spooling of the engines as well as the takeoff clearance with departure instructions, we heard a voice in the background of Tower Controller's transmission saying something to effect of 'No,No,No cancel.... with a garbled 'Company'.' As my FO and I were performing normal duties associated with this takeoff event that background voice caught our attention, I slowed my application of takeoff power while my FO queried the Tower. For a very short period of time my FO and the Tower Controller seemed to be stepping on each other on the radio. While all this was occurring, the Tower Controller told an aircraft on short final to XX to go around, we finally received clear communication from the Tower Controller to reject our takeoff, as I had already made the decision to reject the takeoff because I didn't want to get airborne and compete with airspace with the traffic on the go-around. As I was making this decision and rejecting the takeoff, the departing XY traffic had just cleared the XY/XX intersection and as my eyes further looked down the Runway of XX, I could see flashing strobes from the aircraft that landed on XX ahead of our takeoff and that aircraft had not cleared the landing Runway yet, which was the cause of us needing to reject our takeoff. All of this happened in a very short period of time, and at a very slow airspeed. I stopped the aircraft, made sure my FO was ok, we made sure we had clear instructions off the Runway, I made a short PA for everyone to remain seated and stand by. We taxied clear of the Runway, taxied back to XX and into the 'box' to get out of everyone's way. We then went through manual Chapter 5 for Rejected Takeoff and considerations as well as performed Performance Data calculations. I also communicated with the Passengers to what had happened. I then reached out to the F/A (Flight Attendants) to make sure they were ok. The Performance Data stated we had no brake cooling issues. FO and I discussed the data, made sure the automation was ready for another departure. Once again checked in with the F/A to make sure they were ok and the Passengers were ok. Made another PA we would be leaving shortly and told ATC we were ready. Once airborne we sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to notify them of the event and our actions.Suggestions: Under current acceptable hourly arrival departure rates at ZZZ nothing will change. This event was a simple human error mistake being focused on the Tower Controller handling too many irons, focused on the departing XY traffic spacing with us, the landing aircraft on short final and missing that the fact the previous landing traffic did not clear the runway as the Controller had planned.		Departing Runway XX in ZZZ. As traffic landed and was rolling out on XX, Tower told us to line up and wait… "be ready to go and don't plan on stopping. Traffic departing XY and traffic on a 2.5 mile final for XX." Captain took the Runway and had the engines spooling as we turned onto the Runway. Tower gave us a new clearance for heading and altitude along with clearance for takeoff. He was very slow and pausing as he gave the instructions because he was trying to time it as the aircraft departing XY cleared the intersection on departure. He seemed to be so focused on that departing aircraft that he failed to realize the aircraft rolling out on XX was not yet off the Runway when he cleared us for takeoff. We were unable to see the far end of our Runway until we completed the turn onto the Runway and begin our takeoff roll. As I started to key the mic, I heard a different Controller yelling "no no no" in the background and then I saw the strobes from the other aircraft on our Runway and heard Tower say "abort" and I also said "abort" as the Captain performed a very low speed RTO. Takeoff power was set, but we were still below 60 knots. We cleared the Runway onto Runway XY and taxied back to the hold box for XX to run brake cooling for the RTO. No cooling was required. We ran the Before Takeoff Checklist and departed uneventfully.Suggestions: More vigilance from ATC during very busy/congested airport operations. ATC was keeping everything extremely tight with departures and arrivals to the point of being too tight with zero room for error. A little more margin would have prevented this RTO from occurring.		Air carrier flight crew reported landing aircraft had not cleared runway when they had started takeoff roll. Flight crew rejected takeoff and cleared runway.

Reporter stated he was surprised at the intensity of the roll at cruise altitude.	While cruising at FL310 we encountered what appeared to be wake turbulence from another aircraft.

We were cleared to land and told of departing (Company) aircraft ahead of us. (Company) departed when we were around 1,000ft AGL. It was then that we noticed a corporate jet taking the runway very slowly. We were not told about this aircraft, nor did we hear it get permission for line up and wait. We thought this was a runway incursion and expected to be told to go around. I told my FO (First Officer) this was not going to work and at around 500ft I initiated a go around. The corporate jet was still perpendicular to us and had not started his takeoff roll. At the time of our go around the corporate jet was cleared for takeoff, my FO then communicated our go around to the Tower. We were told to 'fly left of the runway', not given a heading or altitude. I turned the aircraft about 30 degrees to left and initiated a climb. We had 2,600ft set in the altitude alerter so that was our intended altitude. My FO had the corporate jet in sight the entire time. We then received a traffic alert from what we think was another aircraft in the pattern. We were then given a heading of 140 and altitude of 3,000ft. We proceeded on those instructions and were given a downwind and landed uneventfully. We asked for a number for the Tower. I spoke with the Tower Manager, and he said the Controller 'Had a lot of things going on' and assured me that we were not at fault. I filed this report on a general Safety concern for ZZZ. I don't believe we had a near miss with either aircraft, but this was definitely a messed up situation.Suggestions: I don't know if there was training going on in the Tower, but they definitely were trying to accomplish too much in the time given. My FO was performed very, very well in this situation and the communication between us is what I believe mitigated a huge amount of risk in this event.

At the moment of this occurrence, in my mind, I honestly perceived the situation as unsafe to fly, due to a possible pressurization problem, due to the high altitude elevation of this airport which is also surrounded by high altitude terrain. I was the pilot flying and rejected the takeoff. I exited the runway on Taxiway 1 and held short of Runway XL. After telling the passengers the 'this is the Captain. Remain seated. Remain seated. Remain seated.' PA, ATC allowed us to remain on Taxiway 1, holding short of Runway XL, to run our checklist and coordinate with operations to return to the gate. With the distractions of communicating with ATC, executing our pack light ON checklist, which cleared the pack light ON light, communicating to the passengers and flight attendants and coordinating with operations, at some point, I unintentionally set the parking brake. When I noticed my honest mistake, I released it. While in communication with local Maintenance on radio frequency, they told us to set again the parking brake while a gate was being coordinated for us. At that point, I began to communicate with my Dispatcher to provide an update of the situation and set a conference call with Maintenance Control. I indicated Maintenance Control that I was holding my position with the parking brake set as indicated by local Maintenance. After the call ended, local Maintenance called us and told us to release the parking brake as instructed by Maintenance Control. When a gate was available to us, I received a clearance to taxi to the gate. At that point, I realized that the airplane was not moving. I called Maintenance to come and inspect the aircraft at our position. When Maintenance arrived to inspect the aircraft, they found the number 2 tire was flat. They showed up with a tow truck to park us at the gate. The tow truck did not move the aircraft either. We coordinated to bring stairs and buses to the airplane to deplane everybody. Maintenance started to work on the aircraft on Taxiway 1. The next day, we flew the same airplane. During the takeoff roll out of Runway XR, at around 130 kts., we got a Master Caution, Right Pack light ON. After evaluating the experience from the previous day, I was confident to continue the takeoff without rejecting, knowing that it was not going to cause a pressurization problem and the aircraft was not unsafe to fly. We executed our Pack light On checklist, which cleared the malfunction. We continued to our destination. Maintenance was notified via the logbook and ACARS. Low time Captain, High altitude airport, high altitude terrain surrounding the airport.Always follow SOP.

After engine starts, new ATIS changed runways to XYR. Re-briefed the departure, changed the performance data values and ran the Departure Plan Checklist. We had an immediate take off after company and we flew through their wake turbulence at several points on the climb out until passing ZZZZZ. The FO and I commented on this while leveling off at the 8,000 ft hold-down. After ZZZZZ we took out the climb reduction and continued to climb. I continued to hand fly the departure and approaching ZZZZZ the autothrottles pulled the power back just like designed for the hold-down at 11,000 ft. In my mind, I thought the hold-down was 13,000 ft (ZZZZZ from [Runway] XXL Departure as initially briefed) and was confused when the power was reduced. I queried the FO and stated I'm not sure why the power is coming back now and continued to climb. Departure Control asked if we were going to level off at 11,000 ft and I immediately corrected back to 11,000 ft now completely understanding the error. Nothing more was said by Departure Control concerning the deviation and we continued to ZZZ1 uneventfully.Engaging the automation earlier certainly would have prevented the deviation as it worked as designed. Our close separation with company on the departure caused us to fly through wake turbulence and took some of our focus. Also running the Climb Checklist so close to a hold-down altitude slowed my recognition of what the automation was showing me.		Day 0, I was the First Officer on company flight ZZZ to ZZZ1. Captain was flying this leg, and I was Pilot Monitoring. We had taken off from Runway XYR out of ZZZ. We were cleared to climb via the ZZZZZ RNAV Departure (FL190). As part of our pre-take off procedures, Captain briefed the entire departure. Captain was hand flying the aircraft during the climbout. As we approached waypoint ZZZZZ at an altitude of about 11,000 ft, Captain remarked about the autothrottles not advancing forward to maintain the selected climb airspeed. I immediately focused on the Flight Mode Annunciator trying to figure out why the autothrottles started to reduce thrust. Almost at the same at the time, ATC asked us if we were going to level off at 11,000 ft. That's when Captain and I realized that waypoint ZZZZZ has an altitude crossing restriction at or below 11,000 ft. By that time, I noticed that we had climbed to an altitude of 11,500 ft. Captain immediately descended 11,000 ft and we crossed ZZZZZ at 11,000 ft. After passing ZZZZZ, we resumed the climb via the SID without further incidents.		B737-700 flight crew reported climbing through an altitude restriction after encountering wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft.

ATC instructed us to descend and maintain FL280. At that time I input FL280 into the MCP (Mode Control Panel), the Captain verbally verified the altitude input, and selected ALT Intervene to begin the descent. The thrust levers, with A/T (auto throttles) engaged, began to retard to Idle.  Moments after, the Captain and I noticed a vibration that lasted a brief moment. The vibration stopped after maybe 3 seconds and we asked each other if the other felt it- which we both confirmed. We both looked at the gauges and instruments, showing nothing un-ordinary. Moments after, I called out 'master caution' as it illuminated. The Captain noted and pointed out ENG FAIL on the engine indication DU. The EGT started to rise while the thrust was still idle and we were still descending to FL280. To confirm the engine had failed, the Captain increased the right thrust lever ever so slightly and noticed no response of engine indications. With the EGT redlining, the Captain suggested he needed to shut down the engine, I concurred.The Captain performed immediate action items and then called for the engine failure checklist from the QRH. Looking through the options on my EFB, I selected 'engine fire or severe damage' checklist because of the vibrations we felt, I presented the Captain with the checklist for his confirmation, and began reading.After the 4th step of the checklist, the Captain told me to continue with the checklist as he began other tasks, such as communication with ATC and beginning a mild drift down with data from the FMC. I continued with the checklist, reading and communicating every action out loud. I advised the Captain the last step was to land at the nearest suitable airport and the next checklist was the "One engine inoperative landing".In the meantime, the Captain had already [requested priority handling] with ATC and had been exploring divert airport options. He advised me that he was thinking ZZZ1 was a good option. We looked at the current weather at ZZZ1, discussed the lack of terrain and elevation, the distance from our current position, and runway/approach applicable. We agreed it was an excellent option. The Captain instructed me to resume the radios, I advised ATC of our request to land ZZZ1 to which they cleared us direct. The Captain communicated with Dispatch who agreed with the plan. The Captain then called for the. "One Engine Inop Landing" checklist. I ran the checklist out loud again, confirming with the Captain.The Captain then communicated with the Flight Attendants and requested that I build the approach. Once the approach was built, I briefed the Captain on the ILS X into ZZZ1, followed by the deferred descent checklist. We received vectors for the approach, the Captain made a very smooth landing, taxied to the gate, and we ran the shutdown checklist.		We were cruising towards ZZZ at FL300 over northwest Location A. We received a descent to FL280 slightly ahead of the flight plan for reported turbulence ahead. We were using VNAV so I used altitude-intervene to start a cruise descent. The FMC switched ahead into VNAV descent mode. The relevant factor here is that the FMC commanded idle thrust to descend. I set to work on recruising the box.Just as the throttle was about halfway back we experienced a mild airframe vibration ZZZ3ting for a few seconds. I paused and asked the FO if he felt it. He said he did. It was slight, like a cooling fan making noise, a loose panel, or gear door vibrating in the wind. I looked at the engine indications but they were normal. Engines frequently shake slightly as they spin down so that was another possible explanation for the vibration. A few seconds later the FO alerted me to a master caution. I looked around and saw ENG FAIL overlayed on the EGT display. The EGT was rising. N1 on both engines had come back to idle as commanded by the FMC, fuel flows were low and matched, no engine or airframe vibrations existed anymore, and we had good oil pressure and temperature. The EGT was now stabilized above redline. I was hesitant to treat it simply as an Engine Limit Surge or Stall since I was perplexed to see ENG FAIL in combination with high EGT and low fuel flow. I considered possibilities like a faulty EGT sensor. Since I didn't even really know if the engine had failed, I cracked the thrust just off the idle stop watching fuel flow and EGT closely. There was absolutely no response. Something was definitely wrong. I considered the failure and overtemp indications to be reliable.I decided it had to be shut down and conferred with the FO. I called for the Engine failure Shutdown Checklist based on the ENG FAIL condition. Step 1 refers to vibration and, having previously disregarded that as normal and unrelated, we reconsidered. The abnormal indications appeared very soon after the unexplained vibration so severe damage seemed likely. I called for and performed the engine fire severe damage immediate action items. At that point I divided duties. I flew and talked to ATC. The FO ran the Engine Fire Severe Damage Checklist. It seemed like a natural division of work since I was already flying. I wanted something specific from ATC so I took the radios too. I looked up driftdown speed and altitude, declared an emergency, and obtained a descent clearance to FL230. There were clouds below FL260. Not wanting to descend into ice I opted to drift down slowly, set max continuous thrust, and let ATC know what we were doing. I chose to defer calling for the Driftdown Checklist to prioritize handling severe engine damage.Then I took a look at nearby airports on the MFD (Multi-Function Flight Display) and my EFB. By this time we were into Location B and ZZZ1 was barely further away than ZZZ2. ZZZ1 weather was good and ZZZ1 was also preferable to ZZZ2 for field elevation and terrain. ZZZ3 was further away than ZZZ1. Behind me were regular airports ZZZ4 and ZZZ5, but these have elevation and terrain. ZZZ6 was a close airport but it doesn't have long runways and we hadn't computed landing distance per the checklist yet. It also has high elevation and nearby terrain. I considered the time it would take to complete all checklists as well as terrain, field elevation, my familiarity, and weather. ZZZ1 was the best option. The FO liked the plan so I got a turn towards ZZZ1 and asked ATC to pass along to Dispatch what we were doing. Dispatch sent me a voice frequency (ZZZ Radio) via ACARS. I briefed Dispatch and told him our plan for ZZZ1. He had no objections so we continued. I gave the purser a brief and instructed her not to prepare for evacuation. We set up for the approach and I directed the FO to brief it. I made a PA to the passengers apologizing for the delay to ZZZ due to engine shutdown and emphasizing a normal landing in ZZZ1. We finished the Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist and landed flaps 15 from vectors to ZZZ1 ILS Runway X. I never saw a need to run the Driftdown Checklist so I never initiated it, rather opting to manage flight path via normal means.We received a gate assignment about 10 minutes before landing and passed it along to ATC at crash-fire-rescue's request. Landing was normal so I released crash-fire-rescue and taxied to the gate. Maintenance found broken metal debris in the tailpipe of the #2 engine. There were no injuries.		B737 flight crew reported engine failure during cruise descent. Flight crew shut down engine and performed a diversion and safe landing.

We experienced a flight control or automation anomaly.  While flying in LNAV, VNAV and initially having a VNAV PATH. our autopilot and flight control system erroneously started flying to 340 knots indicated and pitching as such to speed the aircraft up. Although only momentarily we saw sink rate values between 6,000 and 8,000 FPM.  While trying to establish what was occurring. The First Officer (correctly in my mind disconnected the autopilot and hand flew the aircraft.) When we thought we had control of aircraft we elected to try the autopilot again. However, it reverted back to its ways and again began shooting for a target airspeed of 338 KTS. and began descending rapidly.  Once again after disconnecting the auto pilot we could then regain control of the MCP (Mode Control Panel).  This time after 'dumying down' the control modes, we were able to get the aircraft to respond to our inputs and Level change commands began.  After this point we were able to re-establish a normal descent profile and speed targets.  So decided to continue to ZZZ and attempt a landing at that time.  Speed targets and crossing restrictions from this point on were met and the aircraft remained controllable throughout the landing.  Sadly, while this event was occurring, we missed the target altitudes on the ZZZZZ arrival and crossed 'ZZZZZ' way point significantly low.  At around 15,800 instead of a bottom crossing altitude of 17000.  Although this was a significant control startle factor. The aircraft never generated a master caution or warning message. At the very onset of the event, I the Captain was making a PA, informing the passengers that due to the higher winds I was expecting some stronger turbulence and to also request that the flight attendants prepared the cabin for landing and return to their seats for their safety. The ATC controller who was working our flight initially asked what altitude we were at, and said I show you low for the crossing altitude, however then came back on and was asking if we were alright, as he could apparently see our altitude changes. I initially responded to him saying we had a flight control or automation issue occurring. But then just prior to being handed off to ZZZ Approach informed him we had control of the ATC and all seemed to be returning to normal.I cannot attest to it factually or not, but we were wondering if the extreme winds both in the Jetstream and low altitude regimes of flight played a role in the incident. Even when I go to make a PA. I cannot allow the attention to drift away from the flight to the other tasks I am to complete either as the PF or PM				B737 pilot reported the autopilot and flight control system malfunctioned several times during arrival descent resulting in periods of loss of aircraft control and altitude deviation. Flight crew continued descent and systems appeared to stop malfunctioning.

Due to current weather conditions, we elected to run performance data with windshear numbers. It was an uneventful takeoff and climb until around 1,500 ft. AGL. There was a loud bang, followed by violent shaking of the aircraft. I looked and noticed the N2, and the oil pressure was at zero. I [requested priority handling] and requested a return to the field for the longer Runway of XXL. We got vectors and the Captain called for the appropriate QRC/QRH Checklist. The Captain made PA announcements to the Passengers and the Flight Attendants, letting them know we would be returning to the field. The FA (Flight Attendant) alerted us that there were light fumes in the cabin, and we could start to smell them slightly. Once we were on final, we elected to do a 360 to make sure we had the checklist completed, as there were multiple interruptions from Ops, Dispatch and ATC throughout the entire situation. We did a single engine Flaps 15 landing with autobrakes 3. We let the aircraft come to a stop on its own and were met with fire trucks. The Captain asked me to run the brake cooling numbers, but I could not retrieve the necessary information needed. I believe I was still very busy and was trying to communicate with ATC and the Fire Response Team. They scanned the aircraft and stated there was no smoke or fire. The Captain called the Flight Attendants to check on the fumes situation and they stated it had dissipated and was not a threat to have to evacuate the aircraft. We elected to return to the gate to get the Passengers off, debrief and assess the situation.[Suggestion]: I believe if the brake cooling part of the checklist was in a different color, it would've been easier to recognize with all the distractions.		We pushed back from the gate for departure off of Runway XXR. I told the First Officer to plan for a precautionary wind shear takeoff because of some convective activity off of the departure end of the runway. We taxied out to the runway without incident. We were cleared for takeoff. It was a normal takeoff and climbout until approximately 1,500 ft. AGL. The right engine began to experience a series of compressor stalls. Instinctively I grab the flight controls. The First Officer asked if I wanted to take over. I said yes. I looked at the engine gauges and saw that the oil quantity and pressure were at 0. I believe that the N2 was also at 0. I asked for the Engine, Fire, Severe Damage or Separation QRC. The First Officer was overwhelmed and it took him a moment to gather himself. We [requested priority handling] and asked for radar vectors back to ZZZ. I called the Flight Attendants to let them know that we had an engine issue and that we would be returning to ZZZ. I also told them that I would make an announcement to the Passenger as soon as I could. They informed me that there was a light smoke in the cabin and could smell fumes. I then said to keep me informed of the smoke situation and that at that time I didn't feel the need for them to prepare the cabin and I didn't think an evacuation would be necessary. We didn't put our O2 masks on because there was no smoke in the cockpit. I flew the aircraft and handled ATC to try and help calm the First Officer down. The checklists were accomplished, and a single engine landing was made uneventfully. I stopped the aircraft straight ahead on Runway XXL. We were met by fire rescue. I asked them if they could see any smoke or flames coming from the right engine. They said there was no smoke or fire. I asked if they had the ability to measure our brake temperature. They said they would not do that with the # 1 Engine still running. I asked the First Officer to get the brake cooling data. I also asked the Flight Attendants for a smoke and fumes update. They said things have improved but were still smelling the fumes. The First Officer told me he couldn't get the brake cooling data. Not wanting to keep the passengers onboard due to the fumes in the cabin, I elected to taxi to the gate to get them off the aircraft. I didn't feel like an evacuation was necessary because of the high likelihood of serious injury.		B737-700 flight crew reported the 'right engine began to experience a series of compressor stalls' during initial climb. The flight crew completed the appropriate procedures and requested priority handling to the departure airport where a safe landing was executed.

We deviated a little to get around some weather on the way to our destination while on climbout. We cleared all weather while on climb out. As we climbed to the flight levels, we were in the clear weather wise. We made it to our cruise altitude of FL350. It was a smooth ride. About an hour and 15 minutes into our flight. I heard a pop followed by a crack appear on my side of the windshield. Then the Captain realized what was happening. He [notified and] queried ATC for Lower. We initially only got FL290. I asked Captain to [request priority handling] to get lower. A lot of MOA's were active in our immediate area we found out. The crack started to spread and bubble. We decided to don oxygen mask if our windscreen compromised Further. We got communications established with each other and ATC. Took a vector to descent to 11,000 feet. Captain ran all the QRH's, I remained Pilot Flying. I went to Electronic Flight Bag and started to set us up for ILS XX. On our descent Captain informed ATC of our intention to divert. I flew the airplane and did the Descent Checklist. Captain mentioned it would be an overweight landing. So, we went flaps 40 for the landing. We briefed the RNAV instead of ILS as ATC advised us of GS Inop. Did the approach to a landing with no issues. We were 3000lbs overweight for landing. Made it to the gate. No injuries.Cause: Wear and tearSuggestions: Hard to predict part failure. Not sure if there is a recommended overhaul Timeframe for windshields. If there is, follow it.				B737 pilot reported a cockpit window malfunction at cruise. The crew diverted to an alternate airport and landed safely.

On climb out around FL280 we received EICAS messages for No Land 3 and No Autoland. Next we're messages for EEC (Electronic Engine Control) L and R. Following the ECL (Electronic Checklists) checklists for the abnormal procedures, I turned off the autothrottles but decided to wait until level off to disconnect the EECs per the checklists. Leveling off at FL330 I brought the throttles back but the airplane would not level off. I disconnected the autopilot, leveled off at FL330 and re-engaged the autopilot in altitude hold mode. When we had finished the checklists I tried to return to VNAV but it still wanted to climb away from 330, which was still the selected MCP (Mode Control Panel) altitude. Then ATC told us we were not holding the correct altitude as they showed us at FL228. We requested a block altitude from FL320 - FL340 and got it. At this point we also had messages for ADC L, C and R, and knew we had a problem with the airplane knowing what altitude we were at. I suggested we try VNAV again. Once again it climbed away from the MCP altitude but leveled off at FL332. Now ATC told us they showed us at FL330. We were now concerned about our legality for both ETOPS and RVSM, and we called dispatch for consultation. In talking with our dispatcher, the Flight Duty Officer, and Maintenance Control, and also reviewing the maintenance history on the airplane, we confirmed it was a recurring problem. We looked into all other possibilities including talking to a B777 tech pilot, but could get no better guidance on how much the aircraft capability was degraded behind the scenes. We decided the best course was to return to ZZZZ airport. We advised ZZZZ control and returned to ZZZZ, using block altitudes on the descent to ensure no altitude conflicts. At lower altitudes our altitude system seemed to indicate correctly and we landed in ZZZZ with no further issues.Cause: Aircraft system malfunction. Suggestions: Fix the problems with this aircraft.		Air turn back ZZZZ airport performed due to multiple aircraft systems malfunctions. Due to the failures, the aircraft was unable to precisely hold altitude, and was therefore not capable of RVSM and ETOPS operations. Block altitudes were assigned, and ATC was advised since we were unable to accurately verify our altitude. Cause: Due to multiple systems failures, this aircraft was incompatible with RVSM and ETOPS operations.		B777 First Officers reported anomalies with Air Data Computers, Electronic Engine Controls, and auto-flight functions prior to level off at cruise altitude. Aircraft had a history of these problems and since crew was unable to verify correct altitudes with ATC in RVSM airspace they elected to return to departure airport.

A 'B777 crossing right to left 1000 ft. above.' We had the traffic in sight. After traffic passed we were cleared to climb to our requested final altitude of FL360. Just as we started to climb we encountered a sudden, momentary turbulence jolt of slightly greater than moderate intensity. We were certain that this was the result of wake turbulence from the 777 that had passed by earlier. The turbulence was a sudden jolt, no more than a second in duration, but because we had been in smooth conditions the turbulence was unexpected, and caught us, and the flight attendants off guard. They had started the inflight service, and [one] FA (Flight Attendant) reported that he bumped his elbow during the turbulence.He said that it was very minor, and that he was fit to continue his FA duties. No one else (FAs or passengers) reported any adverse effects from the turbulence. FA required no aid just wanted the incident documented.	Reporter stated the wake was quite powerful.	This event took place during flight from Denver to ZZZ.While proceeding westbound out of Denver, ATC assigned us FL340 due to crossing traffic ahead and above us. We stayed at this altitude for several minutes until the crossing traffic passed. ATC then cleared us to FL360. The crossing traffic was a 777, as told to us by ATC. As we were climbing to FL360, we flew into the wake of the 777 and our airplane had a momentary change in attitude, which was fairly aggressive.It was several minutes between the 777 passing and us climbing so we did not expect to fly through the wake of this traffic.I was Pilot Monitoring and called the flight attendants to check in on them and the passengers immediately after we encountered the wake turbulence. Flight Attendant told me he was momentarily lifted off his feet and banged his elbow on the service cart. I do not recall which elbow. All of the other flight attendants said they were alright. The seat belt sign was on during this time and we received no reports that any passenger had been up or injured.After we arrived in ZZZ, the Captain and I stayed to speak with the flight attendants one last time to ensure that everyone was alright. At that time, (flight attendant) reiterated that he banged his elbow during the wake turbulence encounter.		B737NG flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence climbing through FL340 from a B777 crossing their path above them. A flight attendant was slightly injured in the unexpected encounter.

During climb out from ZZZ airport, I elected to turn on the weather radar as it had become dark and there were clouds building along our route and WSI had shown radar returns along our route in northern flight path pre departure. The radar failed to turn on, followed by a WXR FAIL message on the Captain side ND (Navigation Display). I double checked the settings on the Weather Radar Panel. All Weather Radar Mode Switches were set appropriately, however, there was no tilt control, nor any gain control (the Gain Uncalibrated lights remained illuminated no matter the gain position) from the Weather Radar Panel. Selected the WXR switch on the FO EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System) Control Panel and had the same WXR FAIL message. At this point, I transferred radio duties to the FO and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control via the Crew Phone. Spent a few minutes discussing the issue with Maintenance Control and we determined that the entire radar system was inoperative to include the predictive wind shear system. The dispatcher and I agreed that with the weather in the ZZZ1 airport area we needed a functioning weather radar. Dispatch advised they were going to discuss the issue with Maintenance Control and the Coordinators and would possibly have us land short of ZZZ1 and try to repair the radar before continuing the flight. Shortly thereafter, we received an ACARS advising of a return to ZZZ airport to swap aircraft. During this exchange, the FO and I noticed a mild burnt bread smell. I called back and discussed the smell with the #1 Flight Attendant to determine if we were smelling the ovens or not. After we turned the flight around, we smelled the odor again, and again, I discussed things with the flight attendants in more depth and we were able to determine the smell was not coming from the ovens or the forward galley. With this new information, the FO and I discussed the odor was possibly associated with the failed radar. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control again to advise of the development. Maintenance Control wanted to give it a 10-15 minutes and see what happened as it was intermittent. Dispatch and I agreed as we were equally split between ZZZ airport and ZZZ2 airport and could divert to either if the situation worsened. I informed Dispatch that it was my intention to advise ATC and attempt to get back to ZZZ airport. We advised ZZZ Center and proceeded direct to ZZZ airport as fast as we safely could. After advising, we noticed the odor a few more times, again highly intermittent and only lasted a few seconds. As we were landing over weight, when we talked to ZZZ approach, we elected to land the runway closest to our gate (XXR/Gate X) and requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting). Approach and landing were uneventful, ARFF met us after we cleared the runway and followed us into our gate.				Air carrier flight crew reported on departure the entire weather radar system was inoperative with weather along the route. The flight crew diverted and landed safety at the departure airport.

We had turned right base, and ATC asked us if we saw the preceding aircraft for our runway. After a short search, we saw the lights of the traffic, as well as the airport. We informed Approach Control of this, and were cleared for the visual approach, with 180 knots to the final approach fix. The First Officer was manually flying, so I used the heading bug to give us as much space from the traffic in front of us while still accomplishing a reasonable localizer intercept angle (approximately 40 degrees). As we approached JALON (the final approach fix), we noted that we were only about 2.5-3.0 miles behind the flight in front of us. At this point we encountered wake turbulence from the plane in front of us, and we agreed that we needed to start slowing down for the sake of traffic separation and safety regarding the wake. We began configuring further and slowing toward our final approach speed roughly 2 miles from the final approach fix. During this time, we heard Tower tell the plane behind us to begin slowing. They then asked about our speed, and I replied that we were slowing to our final. This occurred in the vicinity of JALON. The aircraft in front of us cleared the runway on the first high speed turnoff as we were passing through 600-700 feet AGL. We landed and made the same turnoff, as we knew traffic was close behind us. The flight behind us was also able to land uneventfully. During the taxi, we were given a phone number to call for the TRACON.		We were on vectors for Runway 34L at SEA. We were right base and approach asked us if we had traffic in sight. After a few seconds of looking for the traffic, we told ATC we had traffic and airport in sight. Then, he cleared us for the approach and assigned us 180 knots to JALON. I was hand flying the airplane, and at this time CA (Captain) used the heading bug to give us much space from the traffic in front of us while still accomplishing a reasonable localizer angle (about 40 degrees). As we approach JALON, we noted we were only 2.5-3.0 miles behind traffic and at the same time, we encountered wake turbulence from traffic in front of us.  CA and I agreed that in order to keep the right path of the aircraft, we needed to start slowing down, otherwise we were going to catch up to traffic and we were going to encounter more wake turbulence. We continued configuring the airplane and slowing down about 2 miles from the FAF. As we were doing this, we also heard Tower telling the airplane behind us to begin slowing down. The also asked what our speed was and CA replied we were slowing down. This all happened around the FAF. The airplane in front of us cleared the runway on the first high speed turnoff as were were passing through 600-700 ft AGL. We landed and made the same turnoff, as we knew traffic was behind us. The flight behind us was also able to land uneventfully.		Air carrier B737NG flight crew reported deviating from assigned speed on approach to SEA after they encountered wake turbulence from the preceding B737NG.

ATC queried if I was [requesting priority handling], which I replied affirmatively, due to smoke in cabin. ATC provided delay vectors while I coordinated with Dispatch and ZZZ Ops for a return gate. FO was setting up for a visual approach backed up by the ILS to Runway XX. When the I came back to radio COMMs, I requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) on the runway to check our brake temps, due to an overweight landing. We landed on Runway XX with Flaps 30 and max reverse thrust. I took control at 60 knots, stopped on the runway, as ARFF trucks approached the aircraft from all sides. Fire command advised the brakes looked hot on thermal imaging but weren't glowing. After running the brake cooling Performance Data module, we weren't required to comply with any cooling. ARFF followed us all the way to our gate. Deplaning went normally and after two aircraft swaps we completed the flight to ZZZ1 airport.		[Report narrative contained no additional information.]		B737-700 flight crew reported that a flight attendant advised of smoke coming from a PSU (Passenger Service Unit) light during climb.

After activating the approach, the airplane entered into FINAL APP and was descending on the flight path to 2000 ft, the altitude at the final approach fix ZZZZZ. While on the path, with autopilot on, we noticed the aircraft was descending to be at 2000 ft, about 5 miles prior to the final approach point. As we were discussing this, we noticed that there was terrain to the right of the airplane and discussed how we were well above the terrain but the airplane should not have descended as low as it did, as early as it did. I disconnected autopilot and directed the Pilot Monitoring to select 3000 ft. Right at that moment we got a call from ATC asking us if we were aware of our altitude being lower than normal and we responded yes. We climbed up, and finished the arrival without incident.				Air carrier Captain reported the autopilot descended the aircraft prematurely before the final approach fix resulting in an ATC altitude alert. Captain disconnected autopilot, climbed to safe altitude and continued approach.

I was Pilot flying and flew the airplane manually until we realized we had a landing gear disagree. After retracting flaps and calling for AFTER TAKEOFF checklist and the captain performing the AFTER TAKEOFF FLOW and bringing the gear lever to OFF I felt the airplane was difficult to trim; shortly after this, we realized that the landing gear position indicator on the main center panel was showing 2 red lights and 2 green lights. There was no indication for the nose gear. We confirmed the actual landing gear position by verifying with the landing gear position indicator on the forward overhead panel, which was displaying 2 green lights for the main gears. We executed QRH procedure for Gear disagree and brought the gear lever to UP as directed by QRH; this retracted all gear. After discussing with dispatch and Maintenance Control we decided to request a hold to burn fuel and be below max landing weight. We returned to ZZZ airport after aproximarely 45 minutes of holding. For the arrival we agreed to configure early, mainly to extend the gear early. We landed at ZZZ airport without further issues.Cause: Potentially a landing gear factor.		After takeoff from RWY XXR at ZZZ Airport, gear handle selected up and all gear retracted normally.  After takeoff checklist performed.  Flaps were retracted, and when aircraft was clean, gear handle selected to OFF.  Both main gear dropped at this time but nose gear remained retracted.  Main panel showed two red/two green lights for main gear and forward overhead indicated two green for main gear.  Performed Gear Disagree QRH procedure and both main gear retracted when gear handle selected up.  Communicated with dispatch and Maintenance Control and elected to return to ZZZ Airport.

The runway was very very wet and slippery and ungrooved. I applied manual brakes and took the thrust levers out of max reverse. I started to brake and slow however the aircraft was pulling left. I told the FO I was sliding, as I was letting off the brakes to try and stop the slide and go to the end of the runway to turn off he said "I have control." He slowed the aircraft and pulled it right slightly. As I felt the aircraft slowing, I said I have it and taxied off the runway. There were no violations that occurred.		Upon landing on RWY XX in ZZZZ on a wet runway with 8 kts 90 degrees right crosswind, the aircraft started aquaplaning. To the left, the Captain said "I am sliding "several times. The aircraft continued to slide toward the edge. When I saw that the aircraft did not change its trajectory I said "I have control"  pushed almost full rudder to stop the slide and the aircraft was stabilized parallel to center line, the Captain said "I got it" I relinquished controls and we taxied to the gate. There was no runway excursion and no damage to the aircraft.		A320 flight crew reported a loss of control when landing on a wet ungrooved runway with a slight right crosswind using maximum reverse and medium autobrakes.

I was the PF and the Captain was the PM. We got a TCAS TA and shortly thereafter, a descend TCAS RA. I immediately complied with the RA. While in the descent, the RA changed to 'increase descent', and I complied with that as well, increasing the rate of descent. When the Captain made his radio transmission to ZZZ Center saying we were complying with a TCAS RA, the controller said there was no traffic at FL360, but that we were actually descending right into traffic at FL350. She immediately gave us a left turn to a heading I don't specifically recall, and then a further left turn to get us away from traffic. After we were clear of conflict, we were cleared back on our route and climbed back up to FL360. The airplane's logbook had two recent write-ups for the same exact issue- 'phantom targets'. After that transpired we left the TCAS in TA only as not to have another false RA fly us right into traffic again. A while later we got yet another phantom target at out 12 o'clock and same altitude. We verified with ATC and they confirmed it was a phantom traffic. We then decided that the best course of action was to turn the TCAS off altogether for the remainder of the flight. We were informed by Center of a possible pilot deviation, since we left our altitude without a clearance. Of course we did that in compliance with the RA, but from ATC's standpoint there was no reason for us to leave FL360. The flight continued without any further issues. After we wrote the item up for the third time upon arriving in ZZZ1, Maintenance said they would defer the TCAS for our flight back to ZZZ. We then refused the aircraft.

Put everyone on 2 aircraft in a dangerous situation. Seatbelt sign was off and fortunately no one was injured in the back. MEL says we don't need TCAS. This phantom RA put us in a very dangerous situation. Thank goodness the controller was sharp and paying attention, she prevented what could have been a terrible accident.		Air carrier flight crew reported receiving a TCAS RA that was determined to have been a phantom RA. While responding to the phantom RA, the flight crew descended toward an aircraft resulting in an airborne conflict requiring ATC to deconflict the aircraft.

FO switched the SYS page where we watch the HYD A system rapidly lose fluid quantity down to approximately 70%, and then slowly bleed off down to the lowest of around 67%.  We also smelled hydraulic fluid in the flight deck.  I instruct the FO to [request priority handling] and request vectors for a return to ZZZ for visual [Runway] XXC.Above 1,000 AGL I transfer the controls and radios to the FO.  I then run the HYP Pump Low Pressure QRH, which leads me to Loss of System A QRH. I then run the Company routing landing QRH.  I message dispatch, brief the FA's (Flight Attendant), and make an address to the passengers.  FO informed ATC of all the necessary info and programmed the FMS for a Visual backed up by an ILS to RWY XXC.  After verifying the FMS I brief the approach and resume full duties as Pilot Monitoring. Upon approach clearance I complete the manual gear extension procedure.  We begin the arrival and land on the runway and come to a stop while ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) checks on the plane. They note they don't see anything wrong, and we get the gear pins installed and taxi under our own power to the gate. We chat with Maintenance a bit after engine shut down and give them our notes, debrief with the FA's and deplane.The knowledge that one of the hydraulic systems completely drained itself the day prior was in the back of my mind.I believe we acted in accordance with the information we had at hand.				Air carrier flight crew reported hydraulic system malfunction after takeoff. Returned to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

Captain was PF. First Officer was on first leg of Operating Experience (OE). The Jumpseater was on his observation for new Line Check Pilot (LCP) training. I advanced the throttles to 50 percent N1, engines spooled up evenly and were stable. I advanced the throttles to the FLEX position. Standard callouts were made along with SOP Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) callouts. No irregularities were noted. Estimated around 90kts there was an aggressive uncommand yaw to the left that did not decrease. The aircraft was heading towards the left edge of the runway. I elected to reject the takeoff. When I felt the yaw to the left, I immediately looked at my engine instruments, all were normal and synced. It felt like an engine failure. The Auto brakes did engage. once I had the aircraft under control I dis-engaged the auto brakes and made a right turn onto taxiway 1 and then another right turn heading North on taxiway 2 where we ran our checklists and made the appropriate calls to operations, Dispatch and maintenance. All of the appropriate PA announcements were made. After talking with Maintenance Control a decision was made to go back to the gate. Once we were off the active runway all 3 pilots discussed the event. None of us saw any type of irregularity with the engines nor did we feel any type of wind gust. We had Dead Heading pilots in the passenger cabin. I asked them if they felt the yaw and they both said "Yes" thinking it was an engine failure. After the Rejected Takeoff (RTO) ZZZ tower told us they had not seen any type of a wind gust. they reported the winds to us at 290/9kts				A320 Captain reported the aircraft veered uncontrollably left during takeoff possibly due to engine failure resulting in a rejected takeoff.

After shut down and checklist. went back to check on my PAX (Passengers). The Flight crew handled the situation very professional. The company agents that met the aircraft were very professional . They still had live flights to work and were short staffed. The Company Station Manager never showed to the gate. We left over 100 pax with no lodging, food, or transportation. I (CA) Helped the PAX find hotels around the area and secured a 32 PAX bus to transport them to and from the hotel and back to the airport.

I tried to confer with Dispatch and Maintenance, but the frequency the Dispatcher gave me did not work. We [requested priority handling) with Dispatch and ATC. I gave the flight attendants the briefing, and told them not to prep for evacuation, but to review all items in case another failure presented itself.  I made an announcement to the passengers quickly explaining the situation and offering reassurances. I then briefed the FO on the lack of reverser, and spoiler panels we wouldn't have and discussed how we would configure early to account for the slower flap speed. I briefed the approach, and then switched to the Pilot Flying while the FO took over the Pilot Monitoring duties. We rolled the fire truck for a precautionary measure. I flew the approach, adjusted my aim point to account for the longer landing roll. The landing and rollout were uneventful. We notified ATC after landing that the trucks were not needed. We taxied to the hard stand and accomplished the parking checklist.		Near the time we were going to begin the initial descent into ZZZZ we received an ECAM for HYD Y RSVR LO LVL.  I announced the ECAM, and the CA told me to remain Pilot Flying while she initiated the actions required by the ECAM.  Once completed, the CA briefed me on the systems that were affected by this ECAM as well as updated landing data, and that she would assume Pilot Flying responsibilities for the approach and landing.  During that time the CA [requested priority handling].  The controls were transferred, and I assumed Pilot Monitoring responsibilities.  The approach flown by the CA was uneventful as well as the landing.  We did not require emergency service assistance, and were able to taxi to a pad adjacent the terminal.

After leaving the last jamming potential area on our flight plan we followed the procedure to reinstate the systems back to normal flight. The L and R GPS would not operate. We made multiple attempts with no success. The flight continued to ZZZ1 with L and R GPS inop. In the maintenance history of the aircraft, both GPS systems failed on the same flight and could not be reactivated, so the a/c has a history of this problem. Centers we communicated with were unhappy with our lack of working equipment, even though we legally had redundancy in nav systems for our route of flight.		After returning to the flight deck after our break, the Captain and flying First Officer informed us, (myself and the other relief pilot), that our GPS had been jammed and neither GPS returned. They wrote up the issue and talked with ATC and Dispatch and we continued as normal. We later received our oceanic clearance as normal and advised the oceanic controllers that we did not have GPS capabilities. After coasting out we lost our radio tuning navigation (DME/DME) because we were too far from any VOR and the FMC was then navigating using the ADIRU (inertial). We received a NAV UNABLE RNP message and began to work on the checklist. As we were working on the checklist ZZZZ contacted us via HF radio to confirm our degraded navigation abilities. They wanted to know if we had CPDLC capabilities, ADS-C, and RVSM MNPS (Minimum navigation Performance Specifications) capabilities. We called dispatch on the sat phone to verify we met all of these requirements and responded to ZZZZ that we could comply. We completed the NAV UNABLE RNP checklist as well as the Nav unreliable and FMC Position Update unannunciated checklists. ZZZZ then called again via HF and asked how many sources of long range navigation we had. We talked to dispatch again and then reported that we only had 1 (we did not realize having two independent FMCs with a functioning ADIRU was considered two sources of long range navigation). ZZZZ advised that we were no longer MNPS capable and to continue on our current route and altitude and they would pass that information ahead to ZZZZ1. After talking to Dispatch further and digging more into our manuals we discovered that we did in fact have two sources of long range navigation. Dispatch said they would call ZZZZ1 and inform them and we continued without incident. After coasting in we regained radio navigation from VORs but never recovered either GPS.		B777 First Officer reported encountering GPS jamming in flight and an inability to recover the degraded systems.

At this time, the Captain, in the pilot monitoring (PM) role had announced that we don our masks, execute the immediate action memory items, and run the QRC per FOM guidelines. Through guidance of the QRC, we derived at the conclusion that the cabin was uncontrollable, which segues us into the QRH. In this, it guided us to commence with the cabin altitude warning/rapid decompression/[priority] decent.[Priority handling was requested] with ATC which led to vectors of our filed route clearing terrain. Due to MSA, we could not safely attain 10000, due to the mountainous terrain. ATC vectored us on a Northeasterly heading to clear terrain as it descended towards the front range. ATC was asked to notify the company of our situation as we were task saturated keeping the aircraft on a safe trajectory, while managing the cabin depressurization and attempting to communicate with the flight attendants. We notified ATC that our intent was to recover in ZZZ and shared our critical info (SOB, fuel, DG).  In the decent we were able to gain control of the cabin altitude and dial the cabin altitude back down below. 10000. There was a large issue in trying to communicate with the Flight Attendant (FA) due to the volume of the exhale function on the masks. This was far louder than the volume that voice modulation was taking place. It made it near impossible to hear the FAs and the comm radios alike.The PM addressed the passengers of the abnormality while I handled the aircraft and radios. Ultimately, we were given priority handling by ATC and flew the ILS XXL approach into ZZZ. We landed without further issue, and the Captain reached out to the chief pilot, Maintenance Control, and Dispatch per FOM protocol.

After being informed of the discrepancy, both pilots double checked the CPDLC log and there was no descent clearance in the log. This highlights the issue that CPDLC clearances do not contain an aircraft call sign. There is no way for pilots to ensure the communication was intended for their aircraft. Either a different aircraft somehow received our CPDLC clearance and accepted it, or Center's system showed accepted for a clearance that we never received. Either is a major safety issue.

He cleared us RNAV XXR. I stated that's a little bit late, he said it's because the ILS was out of service. So, we accepted the RNAV. Later, I looked back at the ATIS and realized the NOTAM was on the second page of the ATIS regarding the ILS and we missed that remark. The published altitude for us to descend to after ZZZZZ intersection was 2,800', ATC cleared us to 2,500' instead until ZZZZZ1.  We inadvertently descended to about 2,200' MSL at which point ATC gave us the low altitude alert at the same time we had caught the error ourselves. We corrected back to 2,500' and reengaged VNAV to complete the approach uneventfully. The VNAV did not get engaged originally, when we hurriedly transitioned to the RNAV approach. Better review of ATIS and NOTAMs would have easily prevented this situation. Additionally, had VNAV been engaged promptly, that too would have trapped the eventual error.		About 15 miles from Runway XXR, Approach Control asked what approach we want and had just cleared us to descend to 2,500' MSL. We asked for the ILS to XXR but was cleared the RNAV RNP to XXR, due to the ILS being out of service. I quickly loaded and executed the approach in the FMS and set the altitude select window to the FAF alt of 1,600' MSL. This removed the protection of 2,500' MSL that was in the window and since we were already cleared below the segment altitude of the approach, the aircraft continued to descend to the next restriction of 1,600'. We got an altitude warning from the Controller, and I immediately disengaged autopilot and climbed back to the 2,500' assigned. The rest of the approach was uneventful.I should have done a better review of NOTAMs, then I would have not even considered the ILS guidance. I should have been more aware of my expectation bias and complacency. I should not have agreed to the RNAV approach since it wasn't briefed per Company policy and finally, I should have just requested the visual since we were VMC and had the runway insight.

I took the aircraft and attempted to use the trim and found it inop on my side as well.  We leveled at 4000 ft and organized our thoughts and duty's as to how we would continue.  We collaborated and determined I would run the abnormal checklist and he would fly and communicate with ATC.  After running the checklist we were unable to restore the system so I decided to [request priority handling] to return to ZZZ.  I also viewed this as an opportunity for the Captain in training.  I took the aircraft and radios while he gave the flight attendants a briefing, communicate with dispatch and inform the passengers of our return to ZZZ.  ATC was notified of our issue and gave us vectors to the visual approach to runway XX.  A flaps 15 landing was accomplished.  During the debrief we found it strange that dispatch responded to our ACARS message of our air return.   I subsequently called the dispatcher and he stated he never received our message.  I don't have an explanation for that.		Narrative description of electric and autopilot trim failure after takeoff from ZZZ. The subject flight was from ZZZ to ZZZZ; the aircraft was a B737-700.The flight was a regularly scheduled departure from ZZZ to ZZZZ. Preflight, pushback, taxi, and takeoff from ZZZ were normal. Soon after takeoff, as the flying pilot, I noticed the electric trim was not working while trying to activate it. We leveled off and I continued to manually fly the airplane. We attempted to engage the autopilot to determine whether the autopilot trim would work. It did not. The Captain completed the Trim Inoperative QRH, [advised ATC] and informed ATC that we would need to return to ZZZ. We set up for landing in ZZZ per the QRH and SOPs. Subsequent approach, landing, and taxi-in were uneventful.		B737 pilot reported electric trim failure inflight. Flight crew returned to departure airport.

Oil temperature and pressure indicated normal and matched #2 Engine. Initiated a descent to FL310 and since no checklist was applicable, considered diversion to ZZZ, due to possible engine seizure, and with better weather and maintenance. Notified Dispatch and Maintenance via ACARS. Further descent to FL 240, Oil quantity was down to 12%, so initiated a divert to ZZZ, notified Dispatch, the Flight Attendants (F/A's), ran the Diversion Checklist, and [requested priority handling] with ATC. Reviewed the Engine Failure and One Engine Inoperative Checklists, ran the performance data numbers for Non-normal One Engine Landing, and decided to start the APU. Briefed the approach to XXR and considered options if the engine failed at different points prior to landing. Approximately 15,000 ft, the oil quantity showed 0%, with normal oil temperature and pressure. Approaching 20NM from ZZZ, at 5000 ft above ZZZ3, the #1 Engine Oil Pressure started fluctuating below 15 and numbers turned yellow and red, the engine exceedance indicator box flashed red, so performed a shutdown of #1 Engine and placed the #1 bus on the APU generator. Configured for landing, reviewed the #1 Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist, but was rushed with time remaining to land. Considered executing a go-around, but felt we had covered everything, so decided to land. Ran the Before Landing Checklist with the performance data numbers for #1 Engine inoperative. Uneventful landing on XXR, taxied clear at 1, was checked and cleared by Fire Rescue, then taxied to Gate X. Forgot to run the Brakes Cooling Module as directed by the Non-normal Landing Page. Spoke with ZZZ Maintenance and made a write-up in the aircraft logbook. Cause: Low oil quantity #1 Engine resulting in engine failure and divert to ZZZ.Suggestion: We should have remembered to run the brakes cooling after landing by writing it down after reviewing the performance data.

When given a decent the PF said Open Descent (OP DES) wouldn't engage and was using V/S. In retrospect this was the first distraction. When cleared for the approach, the approach was armed and FINAL APP Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) was cross checked. The aircraft flew through the final approach course which was the second distraction. The PF disconnected the autopilot simultaneous to ZZZ giving us a heading to reintercept. The PF over banked and our altitude began to increase. PM called 'Check Path' and path stabilized. ZZZ canceled our approach clearance, told us to level at 4,000 ft and gave us a vector for another approach. Altitude was decreasing to 3,800 which was called out by ATC as correction was being applied. Airspeed was slowing as Auto Thrust was previously disconnected with Autopilot by PF. PIC assumed PF duties. Aircraft was stabilized. We were given a decent and heading. PIC was unable to duplicate problem engaging OP DES. Once stabilized and FINAL APP was engaged and verified to be working correctly, PIC resumed PM duties followed by a normal landing.		During final short vector to intercept final approach course the auto pilot did not capture and proceeded inbound or descend . However, we did have final app on the Primary Flight Display (PFD)  Pilot intervened to correct and the Approach Controller directed a cancel of approach clearance And told to maintain an altitude of 4000 feet. I checked my altitude at 3800 and corrected. Returned to the same approach and completed. Safe landing.		A320 pilots reported the autopilot failed to capture the RNAV inbound course and contributed to the unstable approach.

Pressurization appeared normal but determined that noise was a Safety of flight issue, ran Diversion Checklist, coordinated with Ops and Flight Attendants, informed Passengers, and returned to ZZZ. Landing weight was 119, well under max landing weight. Mechanics found hole in a window seal. After repairs, we departed for ZZZ1 with no issues. Note: This was a rushing air sound and not the whistling noise normally indicative of a seal leak. Weather was an additive condition, buildups and turbulence. Cause of leak was zip tie that rotated when window was opened. The excess of zip tie poking through the housing, rubbed a hole in seal. Maybe use silicon to hold vent tube in place rather than zip ties.				B737-700 Captain reported a loud air rushing noise from flight deck window resulted in return to the departure airport.

Through flight was normal. Runway 08, the normal runway, was closed. Runway 21 was the only active runway. Weather was clear, calm, altimeter 30.06. V1 126, VR 134, V2 137.Takeoff on Runway 21 run-up and initial acceleration were normal using autothrottle. Engine stabilized at 92.8 reduced N1. Shortly after the V1 call, at 130 kt., abruptly yawed right and the left wing rose significantly. It felt like we had encountered jet wash or wind shear.Corrections were immediately applied to level the wings and maintain runway heading. The anomaly stopped while we assessed blown tire and possible loss of an engine, neither of which were indicated. Takeoff roll continued. No further adverse indications were encountered, rotation and the remainder of the takeoff were normal. All aircraft systems were assessed and appeared to be normal. Flight was continued to ZZZ. Passengers and flight attendants were notified of the event and given an explanation. Albuquerque Tower was informed of the anomaly. The remainder of the flight and landing in ZZZ were uneventful. Post-flight inspection was performed and nothing unusual was noted.Given the weather conditions in ABQ, and the lack of any significant winds, I suspect we encountered jet blast from some type of engine run from either Aircraft Y or the Aircraft Z stationed to the west of Runway 21.

There was just a little bit of light chop, seat belt sign was on, the flight attendants were up. As the aircraft started the level-off it rolled aggressively about 30 to 35° to the right and pitched up what I believe was around 5 to 7°. I immediately grabbed the controls and started the recovery maneuver, push roll thrust stabilize. The aircraft rolled several times, each time I had to do the recovery maneuver. For a second I thought that I had a flight control problem because the flight controls weren't responding the way I was expecting due to the rolling action of the wake. Once stabilized at FL340 we advised ATC that we think we encountered wake turbulence. The controller's response was, 'Yeah there was a heavy Airbus up there. Contact Washington Center.' I called the flight attendants and asked how they were and if there was any damage or injury. They said they were OK and just some spilled drinks in the galley.

We expected and briefed the ILS-XXL approach and were subsequently told to expect Runway XXC and so rebriefed the ILS to that runway. We were cleared the visual approach to XXC and as we approached the airport we observed the preceding arrival land and clear the runway and another aircraft cross at the rollout end. Below 100 ft AGL the Tower broadcast excitedly, "Aircraft X GO AROUND traffic on runway!" Without hesitation we executed the go around procedure and as we did so the Tower Controller made a remark that he had received an erroneous indication from his runway-occupied monitoring system and sounded just as surprised as we were at the occurrence. The controller did not issue us go-around instructions and that left us uncertain about whether we should follow the aircraft guidance, which was commanding a right turn in accordance with the ILS missed approach procedure, or continue runway heading. The Tower was also busy directing other traffic so I was unable to clarify our instructions until probably above 1000 ft AGL, and this delay and confusion led to a disruption of standard callouts and procedures. Positive control of flightpath was never in question but the safety margins were definitely reduced due to the lack of clarity of instructions. By the time we leveled at 3000 MSL we had regained the shared mental model and confirmed the aircraft was configured properly, the autoflight matched our desired flightpath and necessary checklists were completed.				B777 Captain reported during final approach ATC instructed them to go around when the aircraft was below 100 feet AGL due to traffic on the runway. Captain executed go around although ATC did not provide any go-around instructions.

The chop intensity increased resulting in airspeed fluctuations resulting in an over speed and clacker activation. At this point, I contacted the Flight Attendants, had them take their seats and requested a descent to FL390 from ATC. The descent to FL390 put us in the tops of the weather system we were passing over en route. At this point in the flight ATC only reported light to occasional chop all altitudes in the vicinity of the front. Due to MEL XX-XX-XX (Wi-Fi INOP) applying to this aircraft/flight the additional information provided by SkyPath, WSI, and/or Jeppesen was not available to us. Suddenly, and without any visual indications externally or on our radar display, we encountered severe turbulence at FL390.Initial altitude fluctuations exceeded plus/minus 500', and rapid airspeed changes resulting in both an over speed indication (clacker activation) and a low-speed indication (stick shaker activation) were experienced. While the First Officer (PF) was attempting to stabilize airspeed and altitude (autopilot engaged), I (PM) reported the severe turbulence encounter to ATC, stating that we were unable to maintain altitude and requested a descent to FL350. After receiving descent clearance, I entered FL350 in the altitude window, selected Level Change and directed the First Officer to descend. At this point the autopilot and aircraft failed to respond to the altitude change input. I assumed control of aircraft, disconnected the autopilot, and initiated the descent to FL350. Once stabilized and level at FL350, I transferred control back to the First Officer. I then proceeded to contact the Flight Attendants to check for injuries, further advised ATC of the aircraft status, and advised Dispatch/Maintenance through ACARS of the turbulence encounter. Upon landing in ZZZ, both the severe turbulence and exceedance were entered in the logbook. A conference call with Dispatch, Supervisor on Duty, Maintenance, and Chief Pilot Dispatch was initiated, and a severe turbulence ground inspection was completed with no defects found. Preventative Measures: Had the Wi-Fi been working, additional information concerning turbulence reports and weather information may have been available and assisted us in either avoiding or at least preparing for the turbulence encounter.				B737-700 Captain reported severe turbulence resulting in altitude and airspeed exceedances. The Captain took control and stabilized the aircraft after descending out of the turbulence.

We were given a taxi clearance to XYL via Taxiway 1 after pushing from Gate XX. Soon after taxiing, we were told to hold position. We then realized we had crossed the hold-short line for XXR at Taxiway 2. A general aviation aircraft was directed to go around. We were then given taxi clearance onto XXR and then Taxiway 3 to 1.Suggestion: Better briefing of Hot Spot areas for taxi. Complete understanding of taxi instructions before moving the aircraft. Better Pilot Monitoring during taxi. Also, ATC instruction should have been 'Taxi to XYL via 3, 1' versus 'Taxi to XYL via 1.'		After pushback from Gate XX at ZZZ, we received clearance from Ground to "Taxi to Runway XYL via Taxiway 1". Exiting the ramp, ZZZ Ground instructed us to hold position. We had inadvertently crossed Runway XXR Approach hold-short line. A general aviation aircraft on a one-mile final was subsequently sent around by ZZZ Tower. We were instructed to continue taxiing to Runway XYL without further incident.Suggestion: Complete Flight Crew Briefing of taxi plan and threats, including hot spot review.  More focus outside the aircraft versus looking at the taxi diagram. Also, more accurate taxi instructions from Ground 'Taxi to XYL via 3 to 1' versus 'Via 1.'		Air carrier flight crew reported a runway incursion which prompted Tower to instruct an aircraft to go around.

We briefly leveled off between 310 and 320 but the cabin kept climbing so we started a descent. At that time we got a Master Warning due to the cabin climbing above 9700 feet so we expedited the descent and shortly thereafter the cabin began to come down. We continued down to 10000 feet to help burn off fuel to get below landing weight as we returned to ZZZ.Cause: Aircraft mechanical issues. Suggestion: During single pack operations, check the CAB PR SD page more frequently, especially during the climb segment to ensure that the cabin is pressurizing normally.		Captain was pilot flying and the First Officer pilot monitoring. Departure from ZZZ was uneventful, apart from we were operating with a single air conditioning pack. During initial climb it was verified that the cabin was pressurizing according to SOP (Standard Operating Procedure). Cleared to climb to FL350 by ZZZ control. Passing roughly 32,000ft the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) advisory appeared showing the cabin pressure rising above 8800ft. Captain elected to stop climb at current altitude. First officer informed ATC of our action. Shortly after it was evident that the cabin altitude was still rising despite the outflow valves showing closed and air conditioning pack 2 appearing to show no fault indications. Captain elected to begin a precautionary descent and clearance to FL250 requested from ATC by first officer. Moments later the cabin altitude breached 9600ft and triggered the CAB PR Excess Cab Alt Master Warning. First officer donned oxygen mask while Captain issued an urgent situation call and began a descending turn to ZZZ. By the time the First Officer had reestablished cockpit communications with the Captain, the cabin pressure had stopped climbing and began to stabilize. Descent clearance to 10,000ft requested. Since the aircraft pressurization had begun to stabilize below 10,000ft cabin altitude, First Officer removed oxygen mask to improve cockpit communication. Captain transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer while they managed communication with the cabin. Captain began a call with Dispatch and Maintenance to come up with a plan of action. Aircraft was significantly overweight for landing and since we were not in a [priority handling] situation it was deemed that it would not be prudent to land overweight. ATC cleared us for a holding pattern at ZZZZZ at 10,000ft while we burned the extra fuel before we reached max landing weight. Once below max landing weight Captain took control of the aircraft and flew an uneventful approach and landing to [Runway] XXL at ZZZ. Cause: We arrived at the aircraft with an Engineer already on board from a maintenance issue reported by the previous crew. The problem was an overheat on air conditioning pack 1 and the associated pack valve was also not responding correctly to the overhead switch position. A decision was made to manually secure the number one pack valve closed and depart under the associated MEL XX-XXa and XX-Xb. It would appear that the remaining pack was unable to properly pressurize the aircraft despite not showing any fault indications during flight. Whilst holding at 10,000ft, as we burned fuel before returning to land at ZZZ, the cabin crew frequently called to complain of areas within the cabin that were too hot. The pack flow selector had been at MAX throughout the flight and the temperature selections at minimum through the flight so the flight crew were unable to do any more to bring the temperature down. This deficiency was reported to maintenance crews on arrival back to ZZZ.Suggestions: Engineering were satisfied to dispatch under single pack operation, I do not think it would have been possible to identify there was an issue with the pressurization system without a more thorough maintenance inspection. Since we were under a little bit of time pressure with our flight duty limit approaching, this was not appropriate or required as per the MEL. The flight was limited to FL370 in accordance with single pack operation, a more restrictive max flight level may have helped.		A320 flight crew reported returning safely to departure airport after experiencing high cabin altitude related to single pack operation.

During the climb out on the ZZZZZ SID at approximately 15,200ft we experienced a window seal issue. I transferred controls to the CA briefly, to allow me to assess where the noise was coming from. I established it was the R2 window - FO side. The noise was so loud and unbearable that hearing one another was extremely difficult especially ATC instructions. We decided to return back to ZZZ. We successfully notified ATC, Dispatch and the Cabin Crew. CA and I, completed the correct QRH procedures and checklists associated with the situation. We knew we would have an overweight landing so we accomplished an overweight landing QRH and landing assessment. Once we were ready and tasks were completed, we asked for vectors for a visual approach to Runway XX. On short final, we got an aural warning 'TOO LOW TERRAIN' 4/5 times. I continued my landing as I was stable, making any changes/adjustments at that point would not have been beneficial. A smooth, overweight precautionary landing was successfully accomplished. After exiting the runway safely at Taxiway 1, I organized for an open gate with Ramp/Ops. At the gate we completed the shutdown checklist and began liaising with our Dispatcher and Maintenance team to make necessary Logbook entries and co-ordinate an aircraft swap so we could continue on to ZZZ1.Cause: A new hire employee was conducting the windshield clean while I was downstairs doing the pre-flight. Captain was in the cockpit loading FMS while observing the windshield clean. I believe the way the window may have been closed, played a role in the unbearable noise we experienced. Also... On short final despite completing the Before Landing Checklist  flaps were left in the 25 degree position. I believe this was overlooked due to distraction of noise and task saturation. My situational awareness at that point was solely on remaining stable and getting the aircraft down safely. Suggestions: To ensure the correct training is given to anyone who is cleaning the flight deck windshields. Pay closer attention to the flap indicator once flap handle is moved - continue to verify this in my scan.				B-737 First Officer reported a cockpit window malfunction that resulted in a return to the departure airport. The flight performed a safe overweight landing.

Got to the plane and initially the number two engine fire test would not test. No light on the number two fire handle. We wrote up the maintenance item.  Maintenance initially could not solve the problem and the delay was about an hour. We eventually decided to de-plane the passengers as the plane was really hot and Maintenance had told us they were going to look for a part in the hangar. About the time the airplane was 99% deplaned, I was told that they had isolated the problem to the no. 2 B loop system...it could be MEL'd and we were good to go, operating the #2 eng overheat detection system in the A only side.  PAX (Passengers) were then rebranded and we were good to go.Upon climb out on the ZZZZZ Departure climbing through 17,000 feet, we got the master caution light and associated 6-pack light and an illuminated #2 ENG OVERHEAT light. Initially, I figured this had to be associated with the write up we just had, so to verify I quickly checked both loops A and B independently and the light stayed illuminated for both loops. Engine EGT was normal for both engines. We discussed quickly and decided to treat as ENG OVERHEAT and performed memory items and the rest of the checklist. Upon bringing the thrust lever back to idle, the ENG OVERHEAT light extinguished. I found that running engine at a low thrust setting (approximately 55% N1 the light stayed off, so I left the #2 engine at 55%). We had asked ATC to level at FL190 to troubleshoot.  After checklist was complete, I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and informed them I was diverting back to ZZZ. We informed ATC and were give direct ZZZZZ1 on the XXR Approach. A normal decent and arrival was conducted and we landed uneventfully with fire rescue standing by. We got off the runway at [Taxiway] 1 and stopped on Taxiway 2 so fire rescue could examine #2. It was deemed to look normal so we taxied to the gate single engine having shut the #2 after inspection. I wrote up the maintenance entry for the overheat and also for a possible overweight landing. It appeared we would be about 300 lbs overweight but not sure exactly what it ended up being.After the airplane was deplaned, I received a call from the Chief Pilot asking for a quick summary of what happened and how we felt. I gave that to him and it was decided by all parties that it would be best not to continue with our pairing after this kind of event the effects of a high adrenaline event can show up an hour or two later. We had 3 legs planned ahead of us. I was told to standby for a bit as he would talk to scheduling and that the company would figure out a plan for us to get back to ZZZ1. About 15 minutes after the pax had deplaned, the entire crew including FAs and pilots were all waiting on the aircraft for a schedule update when a ZZZ ops mngr or gate mngr (never knew who she was) came down obviously in a rush and said 'what are you guys doing?  We have a new plane for you and we are in the process of moving all the bags over to it. We need you to get over there so we can board!'  I informed her to take a deep breath, slow down, that the company is working on a solution, but the pilots were going to have to be replaced.  She said, 'oh don't tell me that!' at which point I told her I would call scheduling and try to see if I could find out what the plan was. When I finally got ahold of scheduling, the person I talked to had no idea that we were being replaced or why we needed to be replaced. He eventually got me over to crew coordination and they informed me that they were aware and to standby for a schedule update. About this time an ops person came on the plane and told us that they were going to tow the plane to the hangar so we needed to de-plane, which we did.  I'm guessing it was about XA:15 local timeThe FO and I went to an empty gate to wait for our pairing update. It was finally updated to an iteration with a deadhead to ZZZ1, however thedeadhead was entered as a placeholder.  So we had no seats. The last flight to ZZZ1 was a XC:05 departure an hour away and we had no confirmed seats. So I called scheduling again and after a lengthy sit time on the phone I got on with the same scheduler as before. He said HE could not change our booking to a regular DH because 'once we asked for a placeholder I can't change it'. I informed him that we didn't ask for a placeholder, but that it was built that way by scheduling or coordination or whoever modifies pairings. After being put on hold I was told that all I could do was to list myself under positive space and he could approve it. I was able to do that as it was now late and the (delayed) departure would be boarding soon. Unfortunately I got the last seat so the FO was getting a message when he tried to book saying positive [space] was unable due to oversold situation. When I explained this situation to the scheduler I was told that the FO would have to stay the night in ZZZ on his own dime since he was listed as a placeholder DH!  I asked for a supervisor and had to go through this whole process/DH/placeholder explanation again. Finally due to a few no shows the FO was able to get a DH via reservation system and got it approved by the supervisor...I spent a good hour on the phone.		During my preflight duties the #2 engine fire switch would not light up during a fire test. Maintenance was called out and after troubleshooting they figured out it was a fire loop problem. They deferred one of the loops and we left from there. During the climb out of ZZZ on the ZZZZZ Departure we were climbing through 17,000 ft and got an ENG 2 Overheat light. We leveled off at 19,000 ft and ran through the memory items and QRH and made the decision in accordance with Dispatch and Maintenance Control to return to ZZZ.  We landed no issues and taxied to the gate after crash fire and rescue checked out the engine.		B737 NG flight crew reported experiencing a #2 engine overheat during departure climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed safely.

We pushed back and taxied out to Runway 4L via Taxiway Bravo. The Before Takeoff Checklist was accomplished. I heard the Captain read back the departure portion of the checklist. I did not see it on the FMC as I was looking outside when the FO was heads down running the checklist. Tower cleared a heavy jet for takeoff. They then gave us line up and wait instructions and shortly after, we were cleared for takeoff. While departing Runway 4L, the Captain was the pilot flying. I was the Relief Pilot in the center seat. We encountered wake turbulence at roughly 500 ft. The Captain was hand-flying. At this time I noticed we were going through 600 ft. and I looked down on my iPad to verify we were supposed to be making a right turn to 055 at 500 ft. As I was speaking up along with the other Relief Pilot saying we have to turn right, ATC questioned us about the noncompliance with the turn on the SID. At this time we were coming through 1000 ft. and they gave us a left turn and queried us on why we did not comply with the SID, to which we responded we were encountering wake turbulence. Initially I thought the wake turbulence was a distraction, which it might have been and the Captain was flying and maintaining control of the aircraft. We were given another left turn direct ELVAE and passed over to Departure. We continued to 18,000 ft. at which time we debriefed the incident. Wake turbulence was a factor. However, the SID was not programmed in the FMC. The rest of the flight was uneventful. It is my understanding that when the clearance was pushed to the FMC it knocked out the departure procedure. I missed it on the Before Takeoff Checklist. I heard both the FO and Captain but I did not visually see it as I was looking outside.		My role in this event was the second observer seated behind the FO. At the gate the FO loaded the route with SID and it was verified. We received our CPDLC departure clearance which had a route clearance attached with a load option. The flying pilots loaded the new route and accepted the clearance, however did not notice that the load option from CPDLC uplink deleted the SID. The Before Takeoff Checklist run and proper responses were given by the flying pilots. However, as the sitting in the second jumpseat I was unable to see the FO inputs into his FMC verifying the checklist was done properly and the route verification with runway and SID with transition was not reinstalled into the FMC. Departing Runway 4L on the EWR 5 Departure has you fly runway heading to 500 ft. and then a right turn to Heading 055. The Captain was flying and after takeoff around 500 ft. where we should have made the right turn, we encountered some wake turbulence from Aircraft Y departing before us. In the wake we banked slightly left and both myself and the first observer spoke up saying we need to turn right to Heading 055. The Captain began a turn to Heading 055 once we told them the SID wasn't in the box and he needed to turn right. At that time ATC called and asked why we weren't flying the SID and would then issue us an assigned heading.		B777 flight crew reported a track deviation occurred after being distracted by wake turbulence from a preceding heavy Airbus while departing EWR. The flight crew also failed to notice the FMC was improperly programmed and did not have the proper departure procedure loaded.

We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Control and requested decent to 10,000 feet. We completed the necessary items of the QRH Cabin Altitude Warning checklist, and the Decent checklist; then diverted to ZZZ.I saw at least two prior write up on this same system within the previous week; perhaps a review of return to service standards for the pressurization control unit after an inflight AUTO FAIL warning.

We requested vectors from ATC while we troubleshooted the issue. The FO (First Officer) ensured the manual gear extension access door was closed, and neither of us recall the access door light being illuminated. We also both recalled feeling an abnormal vibration on takeoff from the nose wheel, although looking back it may have simply been from accelerating beyond a normal gear retraction speed and noticing something was different than usual. Nevertheless, out of caution we advised ATC to use my authority to plan a return to ZZZ airport. We decided that since we had both noticed what we considered abnormal vibration that we wanted to perform a low pass so that the Tower could visually see that our nose wheel was straight prior to making an attempt to land so that we knew what we were dealing with prior to attempting to land. The Tower informed us that all gear appeared to be down and the nose wheel appeared to be straight. As we climbed back out the FO recalled that the halon bottle behind his seat had fallen from its bracket and struck the manual gear extension access door. We both thought it could be possible that a contact with the switch could have been loose or intermittent so the FO again opened the door and forcibly slammed it closed multiple times. After doing this we were able to successfully retract the landing gear. Since the aircraft was stable, safely flying, and we were in no danger, we opted to enter a hold in an effort to burn fuel to get the aircraft below max landing weight as there was no reason to make an overweight landing and create an additional and unnecessary issue that could be avoided. Once we entered the hold, I called the Dispatcher to update them on our intentions and decision to return to ZZZ airport. We advised ZZZ approach that we no longer required ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) and made a normal landing in ZZZ below max landing weight and taxied to the gate without issue. Suggestions: Malfunctions like this sometimes happen and cannot necessarily be prevented. The problem was taken care of by using CRM, checklists, the QRH, and SOPs to ensure we got the aircraft safely on the ground, and in the future I will continue to utilize the tools available to me as we did in this situation.		Just after takeoff when the captain, PF, (Pilot Flying) called for gear up, I moved the landing gear lever to the up position and noticed that the landing gear was not retracting. I advised the captain that our gear wasn't retracting and we made the decision to advise ATC that we needed delay vectors to run some checklists. We ran the QRH for a gear disagree and did not see the access door indicator light being illuminated and I verified the manual extension door was closed. After completing the QRH we attempted to cycle the gear once more with no results. After troubleshooting some more we both stated we felt a shuddering from the nose gear right after rotation which was different than the usual spin down of the tires. After previously running the QRH checklist and agreeing that we both felt the abnormal shuddering from the nose gear, we made the decision to request priority handling and requested a low approach in hopes that the Tower could visually inspect to see that our gear appeared to be down and that our front nose gear tires appeared to be straight and not turned to one side or another. While receiving delay vectors to prepare for the low approach we began running the QRH to prepare for an overweight landing. After our low approach to runway XX at ZZZ, the tower stated that it appeared our gear was down and locked and that the nose wheel appeared to be straight. As we began the climbout, I recalled the fire extinguisher located behind my seat (First Officer's Seat) had fallen from it's cradle around pushback, and that maybe it could have hit the door and possibly damaged the sensor or some type of switch on the manual gear extension door. I opened the door and slammed it shut with force a couple times and afterwards when we attempted to retract the gear, it retracted successfully and without issue. After discussing as a crew how we had fixed the issue with our gear, our aircraft was flying safely, and we were in no immediate danger, we made the decision to cancel the [priority handling] as we no longer needed the services. We no longer had enough fuel to make it to our destination and decided that rather than attempt an overweight landing and potentially risk damage to the aircraft, we would request a hold to burn off fuel to put us below our max landing weight. During the hold, the Captain gave me control of the aircraft and radios as he updated Dispatch, the flight attendants, and the passengers. During this time I updated ZZZ approach of our intentions to return to the field for a normal landing. Once we had burnt off enough fuel to put us under our max landing weight, we made an uneventful approach and landing and taxied to the gate as normal.This appears to be a random mechanical anomaly that occurred. It may have possibly been caused by the fire extinguisher falling from its holder or it could have been caused by dirt in the compartment, or just by freak chance. It's really hard to tell for sure. Either way, there is no doubt that the reason our gear wouldn't retract is due to the sensor on the access door not reading that it was closed.My best suggestion is finding a way to make this an emphasis item in training either online or maybe even a message just explaining how even though the door appears closed and the light is off, that if you ever experience a situation where the gear won't retract, to forcefully close the door in order to ensure the sensors are reading correctly.		B737-800 flight crew reported being unable to retract the gear after takeoff. Flight crew cycled the manual extension door and were able to retract the gear, but decided a return to the departure airport was the safest option.

Then completed the overweight landing checklist with associated performance calculations. Decision was made to land back at ZZZ with overweight landing as all conditions were met to be able to do so. Then completed the non routine landing checklist and briefed the Dispatcher, Flight Attendants, and Passengers. [Priority was requested] to have fire trucks available as we would be overweight and high energy landing. Landing was made using ILS XXL flaps 25 auto brakes 3 at about 616,000 lbs. and 150,000 lbs of fuel. Landing was soft touchdown and nominal braking bringing aircraft to stop on runway to give Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) a chance to inspect brake and tire conditions.

The left tank was the low tank. I immediately started cross feeding and asked ATC to level off sooner than cruise altitude. We cross fed for a couple of minutes and the left tank continued to decrease. After losing approximately two hundred pounds more fuel, we [requested priority handling] and turned back towards ZZZ [airport]. We were approximately 150 miles from the field. I assigned the FO pilot flying duties and comms. I ran the precautionary landing checklist. The left tank continued to drain the whole way in. We were cross feeding until final approach. After landing, we stopped on the runway, shutdown the left engine, and CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) inspected the aircraft. No fuel was seen leaking so we taxied to the gateCause: I had this exact same scenario happen to me several months prior. In that event, I ran the engine fuel leak QRH procedure which did not help. It leads to an engine shutdown which I did not think was prudent. I felt I was in the exact same position this time. I felt it was best to turn back towards ZZZ and land.

Brought the thrust levers up to 40% N1 and let them stabilize. All indications were normal. Slowly advanced thrust levers toward our takeoff thrust of 98.4, around 80-90% right as I was verbalizing "Set takeoff thrust', we heard a bang and the aircraft started veering to the right. We were around 40 knots, so rudder effectiveness was not enough, so I used the tiller to maintain center line while performing a low speed rejected takeoff. FO announced engine failure the same time that I looked at the gauges and saw the ENG Fail Alert illuminated on the EGT. The FO made the radio call to ATC informing them of the rejected takeoff. We exited at Taxiway 1 and were instructed to hold short of [taxiway] 2. I briefed the F/As (Flight Attendants) and the passengers on what occurred while the FO retrieved the QRH for Engine Failure. ATC had us eventually taxi clear of the runway. We ran and accomplished the QRH up to all that applied to our situation. FO coordinated with Ops on a gate while I sent Dispatch a message regarding our situation. Taxied back to the gate uneventfully, made a logbook entry, notified Dispatch via phone along with Maintenance Control. The engine was on a watch by Maintenance, maybe it needed to be pulled out of service sooner.		Taxied out to Runway XXR uneventful. Captain was Pilot Flying. Once cleared for takeoff, Captain began to increase the power to takeoff thrust. Prior to being able to finish his "set take of thrust, __%" call, around 80% N1, we heard a loud bang, and the aircraft began to yaw hard to the right. The Captain began the low speed reject (approximately 20-40 knots.) with no indication of what had occurred yet and as we began to slow; we got the Engine #2 fail indication. We continue to come to a stop; I announced the reject to Tower. We were given the clearance to taxi off [taxiway] 1 short of [taxiway] 2 and taxied clear of the runway. Once clear, we ran the Engine Failure QRH. Once the checklist was complete, we taxied back to the gate single engine. The rest of the taxi was uneventful.

Both flight directors dropped offline unexpectedly, resulting in the autopilot disengaging and the aircraft in the right bank started to climb. We gained about 320' in RVSM airspace (36,320') while recovering the aircraft position. We immediately reported the deviation to ATC. ATC queried us if it was result of a wake turbulence or clear air turbulence event. We were operating in occasional moderate to severe turbulence due to convective activity in the area. We reported to ATC the autopilot unexpectedly dropped off and we immediately corrected the altitude back to FL360. During the event, both flight director switches were in the on position and no intentional disengagement of the autopilot had taken place. Upon arrival in ZZZ [airport], we wrote up the automation failure and also noticed a similar event had been written up earlier in the month.Suggestion: Because this was an unexpected systems failure, I think the only thing we could've done to improve the outcome would have been to monitor the controls a little bit closer in RVSM airspace. By looking back further in the Maintenance log prior to the flight, we may have been able to see the previous writeup and be a little bit more aware of the potential for this to happen in flight. However, as the earlier write up was very cryptic in its description of the events, I'm not sure that we would've been able to gleam the full effects of the previous failure. A quicker response to the autopilot dropping offline might have resulted in preventing the altitude deviation.		While in cruise at FL360 and after re-intercepting course following weather deviation, the autopilot (CMD B) inadvertently disengaged. Assuming it was pilot induced, I looked at reengaging it but noticed both flight directors had disappeared from view (Flight Director switches remained ON). While assessing, I realized the PF had not taken control manually yet, so I mention it (this was within the first five seconds or so of the disengagement and there had been a startle factor). He took immediate control and corrected to proper path, but the aircraft had drifted up by 300' beforehand.After approximately 30 seconds, the flight directors reappeared on the PFD (Primary Flight Display), and we were able to reengage the autopilot. There were no other cockpit or FMS indications associated with the malfunction. ATC queried (before we had a chance to notify) because there had been a lot of widespread turbulence throughout the region. We informed them and I sent a message to Dispatch to inform him of the malfunction and deviation. I reviewed the entire logbook for previous writeups and found one dated (date). Similar to our situation and Maintenance ran tests at that time but found no faults.Suggestion: This was a first for me, but I would say our initial response to the autopilot kicking off was a little slow. The autopilot's aural alert is so unnatural to hear in cruise that it was a distraction. Then the FD disappearing was confusing.  All that led to the deviation because no one took immediate control of the aircraft (for five seconds or so). Simulator training could expose Crews this type of "startle factor" event.		B737-700 flight crew reported an altitude deviation occurred when both flight directors and the autopilot dropped offline during cruise. Systems came back online eventually and flight continued.

I was PF and gave the AC to the FO and ran the checklist. As we were balancing the fuel the ride got bumpy so we got clearance to climb to FL380. In the climb the PFD (Primary Flight Display) indicated an airspeed disagree and altitude disagree. Since my instruments agreed with the standby info and while following the checklist I became PF again and the FO went through the rest of the checklist. As we were no longer RVSM capable we got cleared to descend. While descending we began to discuss our options to either continue to destination or divert. We got dispatch involved and weighed our options. In our decent to FL280 we saw both engines EEC (Electronic Engine Control) had gone into alternate mode. The FO ran the non normal for that. When I cruised the FMC for FL280 there were no more fuel quality indications only fuel total display in the FMC pages. We [advised ATC]. Briefed the flight attendant and let the passengers know we were diverting to ZZZ [airport] because of aircraft flight instrument issues. On arrival we also got a speed trim fail light and the FO ran the non normal. We landed ZZZ. The fire trucks followed us to the gate no other issues to report.

He completed the QRC and applicable checklists, coordinated with dispatch and [Maintenance], and contacted the FAs while I flew, took the radios, and coordinated with ATC for level off and extended vectors for clearance of building storms and a return to ZZZ.  We observed in level flight an EGT split of anywhere from 70-100* and conveyed all pertinent information to MX/Dispatch/ATC.After the ultimate decision was made to return (the CA was a true professional throughout, by the way), we built the box, re-cruised, ran standard checklists and returned via a visual to XXR backed up by the ILS, which I flew to an uneventful landing and then taxied to an open gate.

As PF (and CA) I promptly adjusted the VSI and since we were in VMC conditions I determined a safe landing could be made. We were on a visual approach backed by the ILS. We touched down well within the touchdown zone, on parameters and were easily able to vacate by taxiway T without any additional braking. We complied with the 1500 and 1000 ft stable approach criteria, my assumption was that we either caught an updraft or some possible wake turbulence that put us slightly high on glide slope and/or slightly shifted our aim point. My correction to this caused a brief exceedance of sink rate below 500ft.				B737NG Captain reported approach instability on final at SFO, possibly related to weather or wake turbulence.

We were behind a cargo 747 for much of the STAR into BWI and were slowed for spacing behind them. There were several other flights on the arrival into BWI and there was some confusion with ATC and the arrivals as to which approach we were being vectored for as the previous two Controllers told us to expect the RNAV Z, but the Final Controller said it was unavailable and to expect the RNAV Y. We learned were going to be assigned the Y approach while 1 mile from the IAF for the Z approach, so we were not sure who we were following at this point and had to set up for the Y now. While approaching the FAP (Final Approach Point) on the RNAV Y RWY 10 (gear down, Flaps 15 and 170 knots at 1400ft AGL) we started to get what we thought was moderate turbulence in the clouds. This started to turn into rolling movements, with the aircraft rolling +/- 20 degrees AOB (Angle of Bank) in each direction. I surmised this was wake turbulence and called "go around". I was concerned about getting into an UPSET at this speed/altitude. The FO immediately accomplished the go around procedure and call outs. I advised ATC we were going around due to wake turbulence. We were quickly sequenced back into BWI.				B737NG Captain reported executing a go-around after encountering wake turbulence on approach to BWI.

The plane then quickly banked to the right also reaching about 25 degrees of bank. 'Upset' was vocalized by FO and then CA, CA brought the plane to wings level while vocalizing 'push roll thrust stabilize'. Plane was then stable, autopilot re-engaged and ATC was notified of event.

While in cruise about 15 minutes from Waypoint 1 a FIRE FWD CARGO Master Warning and fire bell activated. I continued flying the aircraft after announcing 'My Aircraft' while the First Officer (FO) ran the Checklists. We sidestepped 5nm to the left of our route and [priority handling was requested]. We initiated a left turn towards ZZZZ after contacting company and ZZZ [Center]. After the aircraft was secured, weather was obtained and the pertinent people notified, I called the Captain whom was on their rest period during the event; by this time the FO had assumed Pilot Flying duties and I briefed the Captain on the situation, weather and plan. They then occupied the left seat and Flight Attendants were briefed about our situation and prepared the cabin for a precautionary landing at ZZZZ. The Fire Warning message was present during the majority of the event after the completion of the checklist. We came to the conclusion that we needed to jettison fuel since we were going to be overweight and we coordinated and attempted to jettison fuel twice but the system failed to activate; We then decided to proceed with an overweight landing. While FO flew the airplane, I ran landing assessments and provided latest weather for ZZZZ. Our landing weight was approximately 481,000. A normal approach and landing was performed on Runway XX and the aircraft was inspected by Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF).

Initiated climb at 1,400 feet AGL, was direct to climb to 4000 feet and turn left to heading 270.  Climbed to 1900 feet AGL in turn and started cleaning up the airplane as it accelerated. Noticed we were accelerating quickly and not climbing then a decent was initiated. Noted to FO to pull back because we were descending. Decent rate increased quickly and I took the airplane as the gpws said "pull up pull up". Arrested the decent initiated a climb approximately 1400 feet AGL.  As we approached 4000 feet gave airplane back to FO and turned autopilot on. Continued on downwind to return to airport. Cause: Complacency in go around procedure contributed in confusion in maneuver Suggestions: Discipline in procedure practice and anticipation.		Tower told us to go around due to another aircraft slowing early and loss of spacing. We were IMC and were told to turn to 270 degrees and climb to 4000. It caught me off guard and the go around happened very fast and we were both scrambling to accomplish it. When I hit the TOGA button the nose came up more aggressively than I expected and my natural reaction was to reduce the angle of pitch. I over controlled and the aircraft descended a few hundred feet and the Captain called out my error and I started climbing again. We got a sink rate call, but no pull up annunciation. No exceeded parameters were evident besides the sink rate.Cause: High workload, over controlled on pitch. Low frequency of performing go around makes the event more work than it needed to be at the time.Suggestions: I am going to review missed approach procedures every time I perform an approach. My missed approach cadence was disjointed and sloppy from lack of use and I am going to tighten it up.		B737 flight crew reported an excessive pitch control during an ATC directed go around resulting in a GPWS sink rate warning.

As soon as we turned to ZZZ1 the ECAM message disappeared and since we were close to initiating the descent to ZZZ we decided to cancel the [priority handling] and continue to ZZZ. Later, during the descent to ZZZ and approximately 10 minutes after the indication went out, we had the ECAM avionics smoke message again. [Requested priority handling] one more time, running the ECAM and flying fast to get the aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. After an assessment we decided to continue to ZZZ. The Captain informed the company, flight attendants (FAs) and the passengers of the situation. Once on ground a firefighter team checked the aircraft for any smoke indication, the passengers were well aware of what was happening.

We were then cleared for takeoff. At approximately 30kts the Tower told us to stop! Being at a low speed and not knowing what is going on behind me or out of my view, I complied with the Tower request. Simultaneously ZZZ was landing on XXC. We stopped on the runway and waited for the XXC arrival. Tower then told us we can takeoff from our position if we want. Unable we explained and was told to taxi down the runway exit at [Taxiways] 1, 2, and hold short of XXC.  This was already a long duty day and we would not make it off the ground with our MOT (Mandatory Off Time) time. Operations was called and we returned to our gate.Cause: I believe ATC did not have proper separation between us and Runway XXC arrival aircraft.Suggestions: First of all, I'm a professional! I take great pride in my job. But to have the Control Tower berate us on frequency for all long as he did and then give us a punitive taxi so we missed our MOT time is unacceptable! We did not engage the controller after he told us we were too slow to takeoff. This aircraft requires at least 6-8 seconds to spool up before we can engage TOGA. I believe we were admonished unfairly to cover what would have been his loss of separation of aircraft.		Upon reaching Runway XXL hold short line at ZZZ, we were instructed to 'Lineup and wait for Runway XXL.' I responded as PM to Tower 'Lineup and wait Runway XXL, Aircraft X.' The CA and I, both visually cleared the final approach and on the runway for traffic, adjusted the necessary lights for lineup and wait, finished the before takeoff checklist, and verified minimum takeoff fuel was onboard. As the CA had lined us up with the centerline of Runway XXL, Tower said, 'Aircraft X, the winds are (don't remember the specific winds), traffic is on 3 mile final for Runway XXC, fly runway heading, Runway XXL cleared for takeoff.' I responded to Tower, 'Fly runway heading, Runway XXL cleared for takeoff, Aircraft X.' The CA verbally passed me the aircraft controls, I responded 'My Aircraft', we adjusted the appropriate lights for takeoff, and I adjusted the thrust levers to spool up to 40%. Upon reaching 40%, I announced 'TO/GA', clicked the TO/GA buttons, and the thrust levers advanced to the takeoff setting. As we started rolling down the runway with takeoff thrust set, Tower said, 'Aircraft X, takeoff clearance cancelled, stop.' I announced 'Reject!' The CA verbalized, 'Reject, my aircraft.' I said, 'your aircraft.' We accomplished the rejected takeoff, told Tower that we were rejecting, and stopped in position on the runway, as instructed. Tower asked if we needed to taxi back to the runway or if we could depart from where we were. We informed Tower that'd we'd have to taxi back to the end of Runway XXL to depart. We taxied off the runway as instructed. Due to the landing traffic and waiting to cross two runways, we were illegal on our duty day to depart for ZZZ1 and therefore returned to gate without incident. Cause: I don't think there was anything out of the ordinary that we did on the flight that attributed to the rejected takeoff. Safety is always our priority and I think we addressed that thoroughly. However, ATC did not have the spacing they needed for us to depart on XXL with traffic landing XXC. There was nothing we could have done differently in order to ensure we had the proper spacing for takeoff. Suggestions: Thorough communication between ATC and aircraft. Phraseology is very important in aviation. Things like 'No delay' clue us as pilots into the urgency of the situation, but also allows us to take a second and debate if its compromising safety and reminds us that we can always say 'unable' if we aren't comfortable in the present situation. This example doesn't apply to our rejected takeoff, but could have maybe changed the outcome by saying 'unable, we will wait for better spacing.'		Air carrier flight crew reported tower cancelled takeoff clearance while flight was on takeoff roll due to conflict with landing traffic on another runway. Flight crew rejected takeoff and returned to the gate.

While slowing and configuring to configure early prior to the IAF, I failed to go back into VNAV. As I crossed ZZZZZ2 (IAF) it looked like I crossed just a bit low which had me scratching my head because the Flight Director (FD) was centered (I did not verify the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA)... of course it would because I was in VNAV SPD). Somewhere in this area, I assumed I was in VNAV and on the PATH so I selected the approach mins (7600') since I was planning to select the ILS after rolling out on final due to -7 note. Passing ZZZZZ3 as I rolled out on final, I realized I was below the FAF altitude and started to analyze. As I rolled out I got the 1000' call out & GLIDE SLOPE WARNING... I thought I recalled hearing 'ALTITUDE' in the aircraft. I immediately disconnected the Autopilot and brought my nose up to stop the descent and climb back toward the FAF alt. I recaptured the glidepath and made an uneventful landing. Felt like I was stable by 500'. EFB replay showed some deviation below 500 and a long landing. Hindsight... while it didn't feel rushed, a go-around was probably in order.Cause: Desire to expedite back to path and configure early while feeling a bit overconfident how well everything was going at the time, led to a moment of complacency where I failed to return to VNAV. In addition, failure to verify and monitor the FMA resulted in losing track of my Autopilot mode. Trying to find the runway in the haze prior to making the turn to final also played a role in me missing my Autopilot state. BL: No excuse. A touch of complacency had cascading effects.Suggestions: Embarrassingly, it is really about the basics and not getting complacent. Automation management is key. The FMA will tell you what it's doing. Also, when something doesn't seem right, it probably isn't. I should have been more deliberate in monitoring the crossing altitudes. I also should have verified VNAV... VNAV PATH... Cleared for the approach prior to setting the altitude window.		Flying the RNAV to XXR, we are on the arc to intercept the ILS XXR. Approximately, 10 miles from the runway as we are intercepting centerline, we have no raw data for the ILS which is unusual for ZZZZ. I'm checking our frequency's I look back at my display, the magenta triangle is ~ 340 feet below the RNAV path, I look for ILS raw data (none seen), the I saw we are at 135 kts., 20 kts. slow for our configuration. I said add power, First Officer (FO) added max power, then I command nose down to increase speed. ILS data came in shortly after. We were stable on glide path 1.5 miles from the final app fixCause: As pilot monitoring (PM), I should have been more concerned about the RNAV arrival and not so much about the ILS raw data.Suggestions: Concentrate on the RNAV, don't worry about the ILS data. If the weather has poor visibility, go around via RNAV approach minimums…with no ILS I should have said.		B737-800 flight crew reported receiving low altitude and glide slope warnings during approach. Flight crew climbed back to correct altitude and continued approach to landing.

This was written signed off per MEL and aware we were flying with one Pressurization Controller. I was the Pilot Flying. I transferred controls and began running the QRC. A few minutes later, trying to control the cabin, per QRC, and setting up a diversion to ZZZ [airport], as we were 90 miles NE of ZZZ. Suddenly, the ALT Warning Red Illumination light flashed. Both the Captain and I donned our masks and established Crew communication. The Captain notified ATC he was descending. I began running checklist, setting up the FMC and doing all I could to get set up for the ILS [runway] XXL and make the Captain's job easier as he was flying. I don't quite remember a lot of details when we started our descent, but ATC did [provide priority handling] for us. I ran all checklists. We did not drop Cabin masks, because there was still oxygen in the cabin. Crew F/As (Flight Attendants) all did a phenomenal job as the aircraft safely reached ZZZ.Suggestions: Not fly with only one Pressurization Controller .		At FL340 our aircraft started having pressurization problems. We ran the QRH Checklists and informed ATC that we needed a lower altitude. He then informed ATC that we needed to divert to ZZZ. ATC [provided priority handling] as we were descending. We landed overweight, made the required logbook entry, and informed our Maintenance department.		B737 flight crew reported aircraft MEL'd with one operational pressurization controller which failed resulted in a divert and an overweight landing.

We ran the Electric Drive QRH, which instructed us to disconnect the #2 Drive and start the APU and connect it to the affected side. About 10-15 minutes later the APU had a fault and shut down. We re-ran the drive QRH, which instructed us to land at the nearest suitable airport due the single power source condition. After that, we ran the APU fault QRH. At this time, we were about 140 NM from ZZZ, and we determined that was our nearest suitable because we were still in cruise at FL380. We [requested priority handling] and requested direct to ZZZ.  ATC gave us direct, and we relayed our Souls on Board and fuel status. I sent a message to Dispatch about our status and that we were continuing to ZZZ. I then informed the Flight Attendants of our status and had them clean up early. I didn't inform the Passengers about our #1 Generator status after discussing it with my FO and Jumpseater. We were all in agreement that we shouldn't cause any extra stress for the Passengers. The weather was VFR in ZZZ, and we were also very busy coordinating with ATC. The rest of the flight was uneventful.				B737 Captain reported a failure of the #2 Generator Drive, followed by an APU auto-shutdown due to a fault. Flight continued to destination.

The QRH Checklist was completed, which directed us to disconnect the drive then start the APU. The APU was started, and the generator connected to the #2 side. After about 10-15 minutes, the APU failed, leaving us with one electrical generator. We reran the checklist for the Drive light without an operable APU. This directed us to land at the nearest suitable airport. The Crew, including a Company FO in the jumpseat, discussed and all agreed that ZZZ was the nearest suitable airport as we were only 140 miles out. We [requested priority handling] for a direct flight path to ZZZ. After this, we ran the APU fault QRH. The Captain briefed the Flight Attendants and we all agreed there was no need to brief the Passengers. We decided that would create unnecessary stress on the Passengers. The Captain informed Dispatch of the situation as well. We continued to ZZZ which was VFR at the time. We landed without any further issues. The airport did dispatch the emergency vehicles. We did not request this and did not need any further assistance from them. This was an aircraft malfunction and was handled per standards and procedures. I don't believe there is much else that can be done to prevent this from occurring again. It happens and I believe we are trained properly to handle these situations.				B737 First Officer reported a generator drive malfunction during cruise. The crew continued to the destination, which was the nearest suitable airport, and landed.

Aircraft X had previously flown in the morning, but it was the first flight on the aircraft for us. We started #2 and single engine taxied to Runway XX. We started #1 and had our two-minute warm up requirement. This takeoff was planned with Windshear Advisories in effect and was a max thrust takeoff at around 102.5 N1. Takeoff was uneventful. About 25 to 30 minutes after departure climbing through FL260 we experienced a #2 engine failure. First Officer was the Pilot Flying and I, Captain, was the Pilot Monitoring at the time of the occurrence. The #2 Engine banged loudly followed by vibrations. I quickly scanned our engine gauges and observed a red EGT indication and Engine Failure Alert on the #2 Engine. I directed FO to continue flying while I further analyzed situation and announced the condition and appropriate QRC. Due to the loud bang and vibrations as well as red EGT digital readout, I suspected that we had severe engine damage. I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center, briefly described our situation, and requested them to stand by. We performed and completed the QRC "Severe Engine Damage," as trained. We did not have a fire indication or overheat so we did not fire the bottles. At that time, I questioned the severe damage, due to the fact that we had N1 and N2. My initial assessment was that it was severe, so I proceeded with the most conservative option. We then proceeded to the QRH. We, at that point, assessed our position and diversion plan and determined that ZZZ was the nearest and most suitable airport with weather and NOTAMs.I requested delayed vectors to continue our preparations and checklists. ATC began to vector us (heading and altitude) for landing at ZZZ. Once we completed the QRH critical items, FO and I transferred controls and I became the Pilot Flying, FO the Pilot Monitoring. FO did an exceptional job completing the remaining QRH Items and required performance data for the diversion preparation and brake cool module. During the vectors, ATC brought us parallel to our final approach course with anticipation of vectoring us around until we were ready. This caused the FMC course to dump the approach. We noticed this and had to reload and re-brief the approach adding additional work and possibility of errors. FO did a great job in quickly reprograming and verifying its accuracy. Once our checklists were completed and all notifications to Flight Attendants, Dispatch and Passengers were completed we advised ATC that we were prepared to continue for Single Engine landing in ZZZ, with emergency vehicles standing by. We were at this time in contact with ZZZ Tower, who vectored us very close to VFR traffic in the area. This caused a TA. Knowing that I would not receive RA guidance (QRH step), I elected to react prior to ATC instructions and immediately deviated left of instructed heading to avoid traffic that was climbing and indicated 700 ft. below us. FO quickly advised Tower of our new heading in which ATC had no problem with. We were re-vectored to final and had an uneventful landing on Runway YY. We exited and requested Fire Assistance to walk around our aircraft and assess any other conditions that we may not be aware of. We got the "All clear" and we parked uneventfully at the gate in ZZZ. Maintenance Logbook entries were completed.		I was the Pilot Flying on Aircraft X on (Day 0). This was our third flight of the day, ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. Departure from ZZZ1 was normal with VFR weather conditions. Our incident occurred approximately 25 minutes into the flight. While climbing to our filed cruise altitude we experienced an engine failure. Climbing through FL260 we heard a loud bang, followed by airframe vibrations. The aircraft yawed to the right. As Pilot Flying, I immediately took control of the aircraft. The Captain immediately announced, "#2 Engine Failure". I Disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles and leveled off at FL260 to stabilize the aircraft. The Captain notified ATC and assessed the indications. I observed a red EGT gauge, no N1 and no N2 on the #2 Engine gauges. The Captain began to run the QRC, and we followed procedures to secure the No. 2 Engine as we began a descent. The Captain then assessed our nearest airports. We were familiar with the weather and airports in the immediate vicinity. After checking the weather and NOTAMs we decided that ZZZ was the best course of action, as the weather was VFR, and it was also an online station. The Captain notified ATC. The Captain continued with the QRH while I handled the aircraft and took a vectored descent from ATC. The Captain finished the QRC critical items, spoke with the Flight Attendants and made a PA to the Passengers. Once he completed those tasks, we swapped PF and PM roles and began to set up for the approach at ZZZ. I then notified Dispatch through ACARs and requested Fire equipment to be standing by. We continued with the Appropriate QRH checklists and completed the Diversion Plan on the X section of the checklist card. We also ran landing data, brake cooling numbers, and discussed that it would not be an overweight landing. When we felt confident that we had completed all required tasks and made all necessary notifications we advised ATC that we were ready for an approach. On downwind ATC notified us of VFR traffic that was climbing in our vicinity, and that they were not in contact with them. We advised ATC that we would be making a left turn to remain clear of traffic to avoid a climb maneuver while single engine. Once clear ATC vectored us for the approach. We landed uneventfully. We then pulled off the runway and had Fire Rescue assess the aircraft's condition. Once we got the "all clear" from them, we proceeded to the gate. I would be interested in any findings on the cause of the engine failure.		B737-800 flight crew reported engine failure during climb. Diverted and landed uneventfully.

The airplane smoothly rolled left to about 25 degrees of bank. Assuming it might be a false localizer capture, I gave the autopilot a second to correct itself. We then received an aural 'roll authority' warning, meaning the autopilot was unable to correct. I immediately initiated an upset recovery and smoothly rolled back to the right.  In the process, we climbed roughly 200 feet and went slightly right of the RNAV course to get out of the wake turbulence. We notified the Controller of the occurrence. I then fully configured the airplane and flew a slightly higher approach at a slower speed to put more distance between the airplane in front of us. The remaining approach was uneventful.	Reporter stated they were surprised at the wake encounter since they were 4 miles in trail.	While proceeding direct to the GRITY intersection for the ILS 04R we encountered wake turbulence and an uncommanded roll followed by a verbal 'roll authority' annunciation from the aircraft.  Aircraft rolled to approximately 35 degrees and the Captain who was the Pilot Flying called 'upset', disconnected the auto throttle and the auto pilot and rolled wings level.  We reported this to ATC and they informed us we are in trail of a 757. Winds at the time, were very light and reported calm at the field. Once we recovered the aircraft, we continued towards GRITY and took appropriate measures to try to avoid encountering any other wake turbulence. We landed aircraft without any other incident.		Air Carrier B737NG flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence from a preceding B757 on approach into EWR.

We had just begun our descent with all briefings and checklists completed. Between 30 and 29,000 feet I felt and heard a small jolt. I thought the Captain had dropped a water bottle on the floor, but I also felt almost imperceptible yaw. We immediately looked at the ECAM and saw that engine 2 had automatically reduced itself to idle, with all other parameters normal at that instant. However, this was quickly accompanied by ENG 2 Stall ECAM. The Captain immediately assigned me to continue flying duties while he completed the ECAM. Because the EGT was climbing rapidly and out of limits, we followed ECAM procedures to shut down engine 2. [Requested priority handling] and we were cleared directly to the airport. The Captain checked FM non-normals for ENG 2 Stall and reviewed notes warnings and cautions. He then notified Dispatch, completed a briefing with the flight attendants, and made a passenger PA. After a discussion with the Captain, we decided that he would be pilot flying for the landing. We were set up originally to land on runway XL, however they offered us landing on XX to expedite our arrival. We accepted this, and I verified on the landing distance non-normals table that this would be acceptable with the wind component. We were cleared directly to a fix on the ILS, which we briefed. However after arming the approach, it became clear to me that the localizer was not reliable. I loaded the RNAV XX in the box to give the Captain backup guidance, although we were visual with the runway at this time. We were cleared for a visual approach. I queried ATC if the localizer was active for XX, and they turned it on. After receiving positive identification, I reloaded the ILS and used this to backup the visual approach. After landing, we exited the runway and asked airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) to inspect the number 2 engine for anomalies. After receiving word that nothing was out of the ordinary, the Captain made a PA to the passengers, and we taxied to the gate.				A320 First Officer reported landing safely after the in flight shutdown of the number 2 engine.

MSL on our initial climb to an assigned cruising altitude of FL320, the aircraft abruptly yawed left and then recentered itself. Autopilot two was engaged and remained engaged. Initial thoughts we're an engine one failure, however, all engine indications were normal. Approximately, 10-sec after the abrupt yaw left an 'Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) 1 OIL LOW PR' ECAM appeared on our lower ECAM screen. The Captain, also the pilot monitoring (PM), ran the ECAM steps and then verbally reviewed the Notes, Warnings and Cautions. As the pilot flying, I requested a level off with ATC, stopping our climb at FL300 and started the APU. The Captain and I briefly discussed the abnormal yaw we felt prior to the IDG ECAM and felt that was an abnormal indication, possibly indicative of some greater issues with the aircraft and we should consider diverting the aircraft for further inspection. To back up this judgement and our thoughts, the Captain contacted Dispatch and was patched though with Maintenance Control for a short discussion. Since we were due east on our flight plan route and would be overflying ZZZ, diverting immediately was the best course of action. Since the aircraft was stabilized and we had the APU providing additional electrical power, we elected not request priority handling. The Captain then notified the flight attendants (FAs) of our situation, whom also felt the abrupt yaw and initially lost galley power, agreed with the decision and began preparing the cabin for landing. The Captain then made a PA announcement as to the generator situation and the course of action we would be taking to divert to ZZZ in an abundance of caution. We then coordinated with ZZZ Center for a destination change due to loss of an engine generator. We reviewed the overweight landing procedures and I made a soft landing on XXR at a GW of 149k lbs at a descent rate of less than 100ft/sec. We then taxied to the gate and post flight met Maintenance to discuss the situation and ensure they had all maintenance requests and notes needed for their corrective action.		Climbing through approximately FL270 the aircraft yawed abruptly left then straightened out. (I was unaware an Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) failure could do that) My first reaction was that an engine had failed. Engines looked normal. Within a few seconds, ECAM ELEC IDG 1OIL LO PR appeared. I handed the First Officer (FO) the radios and aircraft and we accomplished the ECAM and disconnected the IDG. We started the APU for redundancy and the APU picked up AC bus one from generator two. I conferred with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and we made the decision to divert to ZZZ. FO and I discussed [requesting priority handling] and did not because redundant electrical power was available. We remained ready to do so if needed. ATC was very helpful and the arrival was uneventful and expeditious. We had to land over weight by approximately 6000 lbs. Dispatch was helpful to send landing data. The landing and taxi to gate were also uneventful. The IDG failure and overweight landing were written up. We also spoke to Maintenance about details. It can take a long time to get ahold of Dispatch and even longer to then get Maintenance Control on. 150 miles out is probably too close to initiate. They couldn't really help much and it was a lot of work for the FO to fly, talk to ATC and program while I was talking. It would have been safer for me to be with the FO from top of descent on down. The 'stuck mic' ECAM is not helpful in this case either.		Air carrier pilot crew reported the aircraft began to yaw after an integrated drive generator failed on the left engine.

The supplemental power test procedure was conducted which cleared the OFF lights as the system was working correctly.  A very short time later the crew was cleared for takeoff and prior to the PM 80 knot call the Master Caution illuminated for the windows again and the Captain rejected.   In hot conditions with the system working correctly we need a procedure that would allow us to takeoff. We are lucky it didn't happen again and again making it impossible to depart should we follow our reject criteria.		B737 flight crew reported a rejected takeoff due to the window heat overheating. Reporters stated this is a recurring problem during very hot days.

Flight Attendant's (FAs) were seated prior to top of descent because we knew it might be bumpy. Turbulence was moderate from 17k to 12k. Around 12k, the aircraft became uncontrollable at times and the autopilot disengaged itself. I requested with ATC an unrestricted descent to 6k. The CA was pilot flying and it was so turbulent that he had to maintain both hands on the yoke for control. I recall looking up at the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and seeing 8,800 ft. and 290 kts. When the turbulence finally lighted up at 4k in the downwind, I reported the previous severe turbulence to ATC.				B737 flight crew reported they experienced moderate/severe turbulence on descent resulting in the aircraft being uncontrollable at times until descending below the turbulence.

Given direct KLEET which is on GAWKS transition. We started to get busy at this point while bouncing in and out of cumulonimbus build ups. Switched over to Approach and were told expect visual 8L. We had planned Runway 9 as is usually the case from this arrival. I told the First Officer (FO) I would set us up for that since we were bouncing around pretty good and he had his hands full with misc. ATC instructions like change in airspeeds. As soon as I was done reprogramming the FMC and aircraft for the RNAV 8L, ATC switched us back to ILS 9. This caused a hurry as we were approaching LLEGG intersection which changes the arrival. The ATC instructions were to proceed to LLEGG and intercept localizer. This created a higher altitude situation and the FO was trying his best to get down and slow down per ATC instructions. In this situation we were down going down the glide slope and trying to slow down asap. FO was calling for flaps and gear as needed and called for flaps 15' at 208 kts. (200 max) and since I was finishing up FMC HUD check, I just reached over and selected the flaps from 5' to 15'. I immediately knew what I had done and returned the flap lever to 5'. I don't think the lever was in the 15' slot for more than 1-2 seconds. Flew rest of approach without incident under stable approach criteria.Cause: We got task saturated in busy airspace and rough ride conditions, therefore I got ahead of company procedures to look and say speed verified.Suggestions: Strict adherence to company SOP.		ATC send us direct KLEET for the FROGZ4 arrival for Runway 8L RNAV all of a sudden they told us to expect Runway 9 we were high and they told us to slow down which did not help we exceeded the flaps 15 speed 8 kts. faster at 208 kts. next time I would ask for vectors to avoid the mistake that I did for asking for flaps 15 my Captain put the flaps back to flaps 10 in 1 second when he realized that we where 208 kts. we contacted Maintenance and reported I will be more careful in the future. Cause: We where in rough air and were cought in the wake turbulence from an aircraft in front of us and ATC giving us a last minute change of runway which ultimately played in beeing behind on a stable approach it was my mitake to accept the last minute change of runway.Suggestions: I would not accept the approach and ask for vectors to not be in a rush.		B737-800 flight crew reported exceeding flap extend speed when ATC changed their runway assignment late in the approach. Wake turbulence was also cited as contributing.

The autopilot was disengaged and I leveled off to clear the wake and slowed to gain distance from the A350. We advised ATC who then gave us a vector and eventually put us back on course. We had no further issues and the rest of the flight was uneventful.		We were in the descent into Newark on the Williamsport Arrival. We were following a heavy A350 in front of us. Around 17,000 ft., we hit wake turbulence. The aircraft rolled hard right to almost 30 degrees and "roll authority" appeared on the PFD (Primary Flight Display) along with a verbal alert. The Captain was flying, and disconnected the autopilot and took control. We pitched up to get above the wake and got vectors to the right to get out of it.

This occurred at about XA:00am. We flew ZZZ-ZZZ1 and this was the return flight. While tracking localizer inbound to Runway XXC into ZZZ, I called for flaps 2. At that time we received a master caution, with associated single chime and ECAM. Flight Control (F/CTL) Flaps Locked, Alignment Fault. We executed a successful go-around. We [requested priority].I transferred controls and radios to the First Officer (FO). I coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The FO flew delay vectors, so we could run the checklist.We completed a safe landing and followed SOP and QRH procedures.		Operated XXXX to ZZZ1 then flew another Airbus from a 2 month heavy check back to ZZZ. Was a late flight back arriving at XA:30am. Flight was completely normal up to Captain (CA) asking for flaps 2. We flew the ILS XXC and at flaps 2 we received a master caution and the associated ECAM for a flight control fault/flaps locked. We then told tower told that we would be going around and [requested priority]. After we switched to departure we asked for vectors to run the ECAM and Flight Manual (FM). The CA transferred aircraft to me as he ran ECAM and talked to Dispatch etc. After briefing what to expect such as the high pitch attitude and that we would be flaps 3 etc. we told approach we would like to come back to shoot the approach back in. We had Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) standing by in case of hot brakes. We landed safely cleared runway and brake temperatures stayed normal.		A320 flight crew reported during final approach they selected flaps 2 and received a master caution ECAM for a flight control fault /flap locked message.

I stated continue. Shortly after rotation, FO Noticed and stated airspeed wasn't right. I saw his airspeed was indicating approximately 120kts and rolling back. I did a crosscheck against both my airspeed and the standby instruments. Noticed the standby speed tape was also at approximately 120kts and rolling back. My airspeed indications were increasing and matching ground speed. I took control of the aircraft and pitched 10* and n1 80%. Airspeed unreliable memory items were actioned. The FO then sourced the QRC FOR AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE. At approximately 1500 ft. we [requested priority handling] with Tower and requested vectors for the ILS XXL. We then went to the FM (Flight Manual) Airspeed unreliable check list.  Climbed to 5000 ft. per ATC.  Upon level off noticed FOs airspeed around 110kts and altimeter reading 300-400 high. Standby speed indicating 60kts. Verified my airspeed with a crosscheck of both ground speed and ATC. Sent a diversion report to dispatch and briefed the Flight Attendants.  We then re-recruised the aircraft and performed the descent checklist, followed by landing checklist. On final approach noticed standby airspeed at 0kts and FOs IAS at 60kts. Landed ZZZ [airport] ILS XXL.Upon arrival at the gate we did a parking checklist. We were then meet by a mechanic and discussed our situation. He mentioned that there were a lot of bugs flying around, today. I then tried to enter the manual code for AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE, however, I kept receiving a fault message. I then followed up with dispatch and the Chief Pilot.  After consultation with the Chief Pilot, we were informed that there would be a crew swap. We remained on the aircraft for approximately 30-45 minutes. During, this time we kept the passengers apprised of the situation, and that a new crew was inbound to take the flight to ZZZZ [airport] in approximately 1-1 1/2 hours. Upon leaving the aircraft I went outside to talk with the mechanics and inform them I was unable to enter a manual code. I used one of the mechanic's tablet and wrote up, airspeed unreliable, FOs and standby indicator.		I did the walk around prior to this flight. I did not see anything on or around pitot tubes. I was PM on this segment. On the take off roll above 100 knots the auto throttle tripped off. The Captain reached up and tried to reengaged it at that point, but it did not reengage. He called continue, so we continued take off roll. Shortly after taking off, I noticed my airspeed was not reading right.  it was right above berber poll. I cross checked with my Captain's instruments and his instrument was reading reasonable airspeed, so I handed him the control. At some point of this process of accessing whats going on, the shaker started vibrating. We quickly executed memory items for unreliable airspeed, and communicated to ATC that we were [requesting priority handling] and needed to come back to ZZZ [airport]. We requested vectored for ILS XXL at ZZZ. We requested to maintain 5000 feet, and as the airplane leveled off, we noticed that my side of altimeter was reading about 300 feet higher than the Captain side. While we were being vectored around, we accomplished QRC and QRH.  Captain also communicated with FAs and passengers around that time. Then we set it up for ILS XXL and did a quick briefing on that, and accomplished descent checklist. On the final, my side of airspeed went into the berber poll and the shaker was reactivated until we touched down. The landing checklist was accomplished in timely manner as well. Because we contacted ops before initiating the approach and told them that we were coming back, the ground crew were all ready to have us into the gate. After we parked, we did the parking checklist and started communicating with FAs, passengers, Gate Agents, Mechanics and the Dispatcher.		B737-800 flight crew reported unreliable airspeed indications on First Officer's and standby indicator during initial climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

Very soon after the Packs were turned back on (maybe 5-7 seconds), I noticed the 'Pack L + R' EICAS caution appear, then extinguish about 3-4 seconds later.  About 10-15 seconds later, there then seemed to be a simultaneous illumination of the 'BLEED LOSS WING R', the 'BLEED OFF ENG R', and the 'PACK R' EICAS caution messages. The Pilot Flying (PF) engaged the autopilot and assumed radio communication duties.  The PM (Captain) then started to run the activated EICAS Non-normal checklists, with help from the 2 Relief Pilots.  We continued to climb as the checklists were completed. The Left pack, powered by the Left engine bleed, air seemed to keep the aircraft pressurized normally.  The Captain initiated a SATCOM call with Dispatch, who quickly brought Maintenance Control in on a conference call with the Captain, with both Relief Pilot's listening in. I don't recall the specifics of the conversation; I just remember that Dispatch did not find anything in any written guidance or policy that would forbid a continued flight into ORCA (Oceanic Route Clearance Authorization) and ETOPS airspace with this specific problem (that is, only one Pack available). The flight crew's interpretation of the Non-normal checklist verbiage was that the Right isolation valve (now apparently closed by system logic) was never going to let either of the remaining bleed sources power the right pack in the event of left pack failure. Maintenance Control couldn't seem to provide any further guidance to our situation.  At one point the Maintenance Control representative asked if there wasn't a procedure to try to reset the inoperable valve.  We reminded him that there was--but only if this non-normal procedure (BLEED OFF ENG R) was being run while the aircraft was still on the ground.After a quick discussion amongst all four pilots, it was clear that none of us were comfortable continuing on a 12 hour flight with this malfunction. The Captain informed Dispatch of our intent to return and asked if the company wanted us to land at ZZZZ or ZZZZ1. Dispatch asked us to take the aircraft back to ZZZZ. We explained our situation to ZZZZ Control and received immediate clearance back towards the airfield. We initiated the procedure to get our landing weight back below max landing weight. This was done over the ocean east of Country X between the altitudes of 29,000 and 16,000 feet (approximately). We did not feel a need to [request priority handling] from ATC, and were actually given about 3 or 4 turns in holding to ensure we were done dumping fuel while still over water. ATC gave us vectors for an approach to Runway XXR. The approach, landing, and taxi to park proceeded without further incident.		We departed XXX with packs off by referencing the supplementary procedure and turned the packs off at least 30 seconds prior to adding takeoff thrust. After the first thrust reduction, 1,500 ft., we turned the packs back on roughly climbing thru 2,000 ft. Shortly thereafter we received two EICAS messages, BLEED OFF ENG R and BLEED LOSS WING R, and a STATUS message BLEED FAMV R.  After noting these I turned the autopilot on to help with workload management. The captain/PM ran the corresponding checklist which configured the aircraft with the right bleed valve switch in the off position, the right isolation valve closed but the switch still in the auto position, and the right pack off. After we cleared the terminal area I took over the radios and the PF roles while the captain and relief officers called Maintenance Control and Dispatch. It was decided and agreed by all that the best course would be to return to XXX. While still at F290 near ZZZZZ we coordinated with ZZZZ Approach the dumping of 154,100 lbs of fuel, which ended at F160 while holding at MILIT.  We didn't [request priority handling] and didn't have any equipment standing by in XXX. We were cleared on the ZZZZZ STAR and RNP Rwy XXR approach. A normal flaps 30/auto brakes 4 approach was selected and executed.		B777 flight crew reported malfunction of bleed air system which resulted in single pack operations during trans-oceanic flight. Flight crew returned to departure airport for precautionary landing.

We performed the ECAM actions. As expected, the ECAM switched from LO LVL to LO PR. Since there was no applicable QRH, we went through the manual procedure (HYD Y RSVR LO LVL, since that was the main/root issue). The manual pointed out the possibility of losing yellow accumulator pressure, so we started a timer (as per the manual procedure) to check the accumulator pressure later. It turned out that the accumulator was holding pressure normally. The manual procedure also stated there was a possibility of fuel consumption increased, if the spoiler's panel lost (2 and 4) were not completely retracted. On the F/CTLs synoptic page, the depiction indicated that the failed panels were in the completely retracted position and there was no 'FUEL CONSUMPT INCRSD' in the ECAM Status, but we wanted to be sure. We called the Flight Attendant (who was already aware of the issue since she called us to report service was done) and asked if they could verify if the spoilers were flush. Because they were not assertive in their answer, we decided that I should go back to the cabin and verify it. I did it and we ruled out the fuel consumption increase/fuel penalty factor. We kept track of the fuel consumption fix by fix and it was consistent with the flight release. We ran landing performance numbers on our EFB and the results were compatible with landing in ZZZ [airport]. We then decided to continue the flight to destination and communicated the issue and the decision to Dispatch, asking them to make arrangements for our tow to the gate. The captain made a PA to the passengers letting them know we would have to be towed to the gate after landing. Meanwhile, we started to get repetitive ECAM alerts (HYD Y RSVR LO LVL), so we decided to cancel it. Later on the flight, we decided to call dispatch and ask for ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) services to be standing by, just as a precaution for the (remote) possibility of fire from dripping hydraulic fluid onto the hot brakes. We descended to ZZZ and landed safely, stopping on the runway. We got towed into the gate uneventfully.				A320 Captain reported receiving a hydraulic fluid low level message during climb. Flight returned to departure airport and aircraft was towed to the gate.

We checked the synopsis page and it was zero. We quickly performed the QRC, and completed the ECAM actions and QRH. We were over waters airspace so we looked at suitable airports if we needed to land. I decided to contact dispatch and Mx (Maintenance) control over Sat phone to formulate a final plan and have them contact the appropriate ATC to [request priority handling]. ZZZZ airport seemed like a more suitable place for us to land based off the aircraft's condition and the facilities available to us there. I then notified the inflight crew of the situation and used condition yellow. After that I notified our pax (passengers) we had an indication one of the aircraft systems was out and we would be diverting. We had a normal approach and landing but stopped on the runway to get towed off because we had inop nose wheel steering. We had no further problems.				A320 pilot reported receiving a message for low level of hydraulic fluid. Flight diverted and after landing was towed off runway.

The autopilot (CMD B) and autothrottle were engaged, and we were climbing at Mach .79. The event began with aircraft buffeting that started light and increased to moderate, followed by the aircraft starting to roll to the left and then right. The First Officer who was the PF disconnected the autopilot, lowered the nose slightly which stopped our climb and began to regain positive aircraft control. The buffeting and rolling action stopped and we began our climb again only to encounter the same event again. This time we decided to descend the aircraft in which the buffeting and rolling actions stopped and we leveled at FL310. While descending to FL310 we received clearance from Center to level at FL310. Once level at FL310 the autopilot (CMD B) was re-engaged with no issues. The total event time was approximately 2 minutes. At this point we began to troubleshoot, there were no abnormal systems indications, engine indications, or annunciation lights. We transferred aircraft control and I disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle to feel the flight controls and how the aircraft was responding. Everything felt to be normal. We had the flight attendants take their jump seats at the beginning of the event, so at this point we had them check in. I utilized the function to get a patch through to Maintenance Control. I debriefed them on the event, they were unaware of any other similar events and believed it to have been a wake turbulence encounter. The First Officer and myself made the decision to continue the flight, but if we experienced the same event again to consider a landing at the nearest suitable airport. The remainder of the flight was uneventful, and roughly 10 minutes after the event we resumed our climb to our cruising altitude without further issues. Upon arrival into DEN I was still unsure on the cause of the event and felt it necessary to make an ELB (Electronic Log Book) report to have the aircraft inspected before a further flight. At the beginning of the event it felt like wake turbulence, after querying ATC the only aircraft above us was another B737, as well a B787 who was further ahead of us. As well there were no reported turbulence events in our vicinity. There was never an indication of a systems issue, however we both agreed the event to have seemed abnormal.

We reviewed the MELs, most were just placards, but one: 36-11-XX-X specified a unique procedure regarding the high pressure valve. We briefed the OEB61 Issue 1.0: CAB PR EXCESS CAB ALT and determined that if an excess cab alt alert appeared that we 'may unduly disregard the CAB PR EXCESS CAB ALT alert, or delay the start of the emergency descent when recard. The captain performed pilot flying duties while I performed Pilot monitoring duties. We followed the procedure for the MEL's procedure on taxi and takeoff, and climbed out normally. We reached cruise at FL340, shortly after cruising for a few minutes, a CAB PR SYS 2 FAULT message appeared on the ECAM. We evaluated the message, compared it with the OEB (Operations Engineering Bulletin), determined the message differed from the OEB. Within about 20 seconds of this message, the Flight attendants called: the captain took the message in which the flight attendants indicated that their emergency light for pressurization was going off, aural warning for depressurization was going off, and it was communicated that they might be having a depressurization issue in the cabin. Following this information, we immediately put our oxygen masks on; the captain indicated for me to take the flight controls, descend, and request that ATC give us a descent and a turn back towards ZZZ.  We came to the conclusion that based off the CAB PR SYS 2 FAULT, the aural and visual warnings in the cabin, and the desire for the safest outcome, we agreed to descend to 10,000 feet to assure the safety of our crew and passengers. We were overflying our OA1 point and decided to [advise ATC] to remove any altitude or heading restrictions and allow us to return back to ZZZ rather than diverting towards ZZZ1. We agreed that given the stress of the situation and the possible safety risk of our passengers that reconvening in a holding pattern at 10,000 feet would be the safest decision to safely aviate the aircraft, determine our best course of navigation, and later inform ATC of our plan. Once we reached 10,000 feet, ECAM messages cleared and our pressurization gauges indicated normal operation. We held for about an hour to burn off enough fuel to get the aircraft below the max landing weight. We briefed over our plan, updated our route, and checked in on the well-being of the each other, our flight attendants, and the passenger on board. We notified dispatch, ATC, and made sure all of the appropriate sources were properly notified. Once below our max landing weight of 145,505 lbs, we notified ATC that we would like to head back to ZZZ. They rerouted us to allow us to safely navigate back to the airport at 10,000 feet, and joined the ILS via a few fixes and radar vectors. We landed safely and taxied back to the gate as if it were a normal operation. We debriefed the situation and determined that heading back to the airport was still the safest decision and were ultimately happy with the outcome of our decision-making.				A320 First Officer reported a pressurization alert resulted in a diversion to a safe landing. First Officer also indicated an operations engineering bulletin confused flight crew about the validity of ECAM alert.

Just past FL330 the aircraft began a subtle shake for approximately 10-15 seconds after which the aircraft began to drop the right wing. I disconnected the autopilot and corrected with approximately 1/2-3/4 scale deflection on the control wheel back to the left which resulted in the aircraft to enter a left wing low state. Finally correcting back to the right, the captain and I agreed to lower the nose and level off the vibrations subsided. Still hand flying I tried a climb once more to FL370, the aircraft once again began to shake and we agreed to descend to FL310. On the descent the vibrations stopped and I reengaged the autopilot in level flight, once level the CA assumed control of the aircraft to feel out the flight controls and could not replicate the unstable aircraft state. We agreed to continue to ZZZ and landed uneventfully.	Reporter stated that he checked with Maintenance the day after the event, but no cause was found. Reporter further stated he considered the possibility of a wake turbulence encounter, but this buffet/vibration did not feel like other wake encounters, it was more gradual and subtle. The only reported traffic in their area was a B787 about ten minutes ahead of them. Cause remains undetermined. Aircraft type reported as B737-800 or B737-900, not a MAX.			B737 First Officer reported during climb aircraft began a subtle shake followed by a right then left wing drop resulted in pilot descent which stabilized aircraft.

We had an FAA inspector in the Jumpseat. After setting takeoff thrust, everything appeared to be operating normally. Thrust was set and the takeoff roll began. First officer called out rotate at rotation speed and liftoff occurred. As soon as we were airborne, I immediately noticed the left engine EGT was red and reached 990 if I remember correctly. At thrust reduction, it went back to normal range. I then ordered the first officer to notify departure and ask to stop climb at 5,000 feet for the possibility of return. After receiving the ok to stay at 5k, I transferred controls to the first officer. I then contacted dispatch via sat phone and maintenance was also patched in. The maintenance controller said this was a reoccurring event. It had happened a few times in the very recent past. We ran the QRH, did the landing assessment and I contacted dispatch again to verify and back up our landing distance calculations based on current weight. We [requested priority assistance] and requested runways XXL. ATC obliged. The Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was also dispatched. We landed about 8,000 lbs over weight at about 200 fpm. Pulled off the runway and had the emergency vehicles do an exterior inspection. They said everything looked normal and the ARFF folks notified us the brakes were less than 200 degrees. We then performed after landing checks and proceeded to the gate and logbook entries were made. Aircraft was removed from service.Cause: Recurring event that was not attended to.This was a repetitive fault. According to MX, this had happened I believe three times in less than three weeks. Maybe fix it first or second time?				B737-800 air carrier flight crew reported an engine over temperature malfunction during takeoff and initial climb. The crew returned to the departure airport and landed overweight.

Vectors included a descent to 3000' and towards ZZZZZ1. As we approached ZZZZZ1 from the east at ~ 3000 and 250 KIAS, we were cleared the visual XX. Due to the non-ideal direction to ZZZZZ1, pilot monitoring (PM) suggested direct ZZZZZ2, and I concurred. Autopilot started the turn to ZZZZZ2 and I input a decent to 2600 with 1500fpm (as we were still high), but due to airspeed the Autopilot overshot and had us on the east side of the river. I decided to correct manually so I disconnected the Autopilot and hand flew the remainder of the approach. I failed to request to have the Flight Director (FD) turned off and fixated outside to fly the runway. As a result, we descended to ~1,000', prior to ZZZZZ3. Being off the anticipated glide path with FD on the Autothrottles added power resulting in increasing airspeed. I elected to disengage Autothrottles at that time. As we were low, a terrian cation annuciation was activated. A couple seconds later, the PM directed a go around (GA) as we descended through 800'. At that time we were configured flaps 20 and gear down. The GA was non-standard as it was initiated at 800', as such I incorrected did not apply standard GA procedures. Instead, I pushed the throttles up (not to TOGA) and started a climb. PM reported the GA and we were immediately given a heading and altitude to fly. With positive rate I directed Gear UP and Flaps 1 passing F speed and directed the PM to bug 200 KIAS. At that time I engaged the Autothrottles. We then received vectors for the visual XX which was flown without event.Cause: Over-reliance on Automation, leading to decay in hand flying skills and scan. I try to handfly with Autothrottles off at least on approach per trip. They are always non-challenging ILS approaches. Last leg and 2 members of crew (1 P and 1 FA) had tight connections. This was discussed in the Arrival Brief.Suggestions: The chain of errors started on the arrival. As pilot flying (PF), I was flying faster than standard in order to give the crewmembers with tight commutes a better chance to make it. Approaching ZZZZZ1, we were still at ~250 KIAS, and as soon as we were cleared the visual, I should have immediately slowed to below flap extension speeds. I also should not have descended at 1500fpm approaching ZZZZZ2, but should have stayed level, slowed and configured prior to descending. On the GA, as we were below 1000' I should have applied SOP		We were set up for a left-turn to ZZZZZ1 on the visual XX at ZZZ. We were number 1 for the approach, and the pilot flying had his speed at 250kts. We turned inside of ZZZZZ1 to ZZZZZ4 and the PF tried to slow the aircraft, configure flaps, and fly the visual approach procedure. As the PM, I was heads-down monitoring our flap speeds as I knew we were fast and it was going to be a challenge to configure. Approaching the waypoint ZZZZZ2, the Airbus did not execute the required right turn to the next point, I think it did not hack the turn because we were too fast. We might have had flaps 1 out at this point. The PF kicked off the Autopilot and intervened. He started flying the approach visually, but the approach mode was no longer engaged, so the PF did not have any vertical guidance to go with his visual lateral guidance. I looked up and noticed we were low. I am not sure how low, but based on my experience, probably 200-300 feet low. as the PM and Captain, I told the PF we were low and to climb or level off. We continued to descend with flaps in setting 2 now. The PF called for flaps 3 at 800', I directed a go-around at this point as we were not stable on the approach. We executed a normal go-around and returned for an uneventful 2nd approach. There were several causal factors: 1. Perceived pressure by the PF to land quickly. We were both commuters and had talked about that we had a tight timeline to make our commutes. However, as the Captain, I never explicitly said, 'let's keep your speed up' or anything like that. In my own review of the event, it was clear to me the PF felt pressure to be 'fast' when it was not required or requested. 2. Energy management was poor. The PF had too much speed as we started our turn towards ZZZZZ1. It was salvageable if we configured early to bleed the speed off, however, as a crew we did not, and the excess energy led to time compression and eventually an unstable approach. 3. Flight Mode Awareness. The PF kicked off the Autopilot, but in the course of the events, also lost the approach mode, which provides vertical as well as lateral guidance. Without the vertical guidance, we carried too-high of a rate-of-descent and ultimately were low on the approach. At one point, the PM had to tell the PM to level off or climb based on visual cues that we were too low. 4. Get-there-itis. The PF continued to press the approach, calling for Flaps 3 below 1000' (unstable) and most-likely cause was trying to hack the approach because if we did a go-around, he might have been concerned we would miss a commute. There was never any direction to 'make the commute' but in retrospect, the PF seemed to internalize perceived pressure and this led to a decision to continue a bad approach in order to not do a go-around. Suggestions: A clear discussion about expectations during the arrival brief that there is no pressure at all to get the aircraft on deck 'quickly'. Second, as the Captain and PM, I could have directed the PF to control his energy better on downwind, to get to Flaps 1 prior to the turn towards the approach. Thirdly, if you are unstable, and we were low which is unstable, then execute the go-around then.		Air carrier flight crew reported unstable approach and CFIT alert. They performed a go around and landed uneventfully.

Captain was the pilot monitoring and the first officer was the pilot flying. These duties remained for the entire flight. Climbing through 10,000' MSL Master Caution light illuminated with ENG and associated ENG 2 OVERHEAT. QRC procedure was executed and the light extinguished at roughly 50% n1. We [advised ATC] an immediate turn back to the airfield. The QRH was then completed with the #2 engine planned to remain at 40%. The aircraft remained at 11,000' receiving radar vectors while the remaining checklist were completed. During this time the Non-Routine Landing Considerations Checklist was accomplished. ACARS code was used to notify dispatch of the situation and the airfield returning to. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was requested with ATC. The flight attendants received their brief of a Precautionary Landing, and the passengers were given a brief PA of the situation and that safety vehicles would be present for an inspection upon landing. The aircraft was then prepared for the RNAV (RNP) X Rwy XXR from ZZZZZ [waypoint]. Due to the high airfield temperatures and elevation, a flaps 15 landing was planned for incase of a go around with reduced thrust from the #2 engine. ATC gave a descent to 8,000' and clearance was given for the approach. Shortly after the aircraft slowed below commanded flap speed and the increased thrust was not sufficient in level flight. The aircraft descended to regain airspeed, and ATC gave a new clearance to maintain 7,000' until ZZZZZ still cleared for the approach. Airspeed was quickly regained and not a factor for the remainder of the flight. During short final the crew received several 'glide slope' aural warnings. This was due to having an ILS frequency tuned to a runway not in use. This was acknowledged, disregarded, and the aircraft never left stable criteria. An uneventful landing was made with the aircraft stopping next to the '3' board where ARFF was positioned. A PA was made to reassure the passengers of a brief inspection and to remain seated.  There was a brief delay in being able to reach the fire commander, but eventually the aircrew and fire command were able to establish communication on a dedicated frequency. Fire command used thermal cameras to verify there was no fire threat and the aircraft was able to safely taxi back to the gate with 2 engines. The aircraft executed a 180* turn on the runway per ATC's instruction and fire command followed the aircraft back to the gate uneventfully. This was a repeat write-up with the exact scenario occurring just two flights before. This was the first time we were operating this aircraft and upon preflight inspection we found loop B on the ENG 2 OVERHEAT inoperative. Contract maintenance was brought out and MEL'd loop B with loop A still functional. We had the discussion in our departure briefing to be prepared for this overheat condition, since no actual bleed air leak was found or fixed in the logbook; only the engine core fire detection system was replaced. After the flight, we were able to go outside with the mechanic and see the engine cowl. The QRC/QRH procedure was adequate for the most part. Had the OVERHEAT light remained illuminated the QRH directed to 'Go to the ENGINE FIRE or Engine Severe Damage or Separation Checklist.' It is unclear if that meant to execute that checklist, or to just go there and wait for a condition of that checklist and if such a condition was met, only then do you execute it.

A minute or two after the Relief Pilot buckled in, we hit moderate wake turbulence from a 777-300 at FL350 ahead of us. It was very strong with a hard rolling moment. I remembered that we can never slop left, so I asked the Relief Pilot to give me a mile offset to the right, which we did, and instantly got out of the wake turbulence. As soon as we rolled wings level however, I then remembered that we had already offset R2 several hours earlier as we entered the tracks. We discussed it and decided to offset back left to 0. We were probably only wings level offset R3 for about 3 minutes until we realized the error and corrected it. There was no other traffic in our area according to SkyPath.

It was at least 10 miles in front of us and well above us but there was no wind. I was hand flying at the time.The amber low speed awareness band was only about 15 knots below our current speed as we were heavy and on an NADP-1 (Noise Abatement Departure Procedure) departure, having just raised the flaps to zero and accelerating to clean maneuver speed, I slightly lowered the nose to gain some speed and give us a bigger speed margin. Shortly thereafter the wake increased and we received a momentary stick shaker (less than a second). We were not slower than the amber band and the wake was not that bad (15 degree Angle of Bank oscillations). I called "UPSET", lowered the nose further and kept the wings level. By the time I could even consider increasing thrust we were out of the wake and accelerating.		On the climb out of SFO at roughly 4,000 feet we encountered what we think was wake turbulence from the B777 that took off in front of us prior. My estimate is that the B777 was around 8-10 miles in front of us when we encountered it. Since this was an NADP-1 (Noise Abatement Departure Procedure) departure we had just cleaned the aircraft up and was accelerating to climb speed. This was a vulnerable situation to hit wake turbulence in. The CA was flying and announced 'UPSET', lowered the noise and got a brief stick shaker (less than a second) and we were quickly out of it. It happened quickly and the whole encounter lasted around 5 seconds. The autopilot was still off, and the auto throttles were on and never shut off. Since it happened so quickly, I think that is why we never shut them off, and having the autopilot off may have resulted in forgetting the auto throttles as well.		B737NG flight crew reported an inflight upset and momentary stick shaker after encountering wake turbulence departing SFO 10 miles in trail of a B777.

At approximately 2.5 mile final, a Company 737 who was holding short of the runway was cleared for takeoff on Runway XX. The flight crew believed that this was a possible go around situation immediately if the 737 was slow to take the runway. I should note here that our flight and the Company flight were the only two airplanes moving on and around the airport- it was not busy at all. We continued our approach, flying a flaps full configuration with a relatively slow approach speed, while keeping a close eye on the Company 737. As we approached closer to the runway, we believed that we had been backed into a corner by the Tower's takeoff clearance to the 737 and a go-around would have put us climbing directly over the top of the departing airplane while performing the go around procedure. The Captain chose to continue while I monitored the exact progress of the 737 on their takeoff roll. As we were in the flare, the company aircraft rotated several thousand feet down the runway in front of us, and we touched down approximately 1-2 seconds after their wheels left the runway. The landing, rollout, and runway exit were uneventful. After clearing the runway, I asked Tower "Do you think that was close?" To which the Tower controller responded, "that's what we aim for" or something close to that quote. Both the Captain and I have never experienced traffic separation that close, even at the most congested airports we fly to. We were both caught off-guard by the controllers response and as if nothing really occurred in their mind. In hindsight, we probably should have conducted a go-around earlier when we truly realized we were not going to have adequate separation. This could have allowed us to deconflict the two airplanes by turning and climbing earlier than getting into a situation where a go-around would have put us dangerously close and potentially over top of the departing 737. I believe the major causal factor in this situation was Tower clearing the 737 for takeoff while we were on short final to Runway XX. Had they been in a "line up and wait" position, then cleared for takeoff, we believe that we would have had comfortable separation from them. However, this was the closest I have ever seen two airplanes almost being on the runway at the same time, and a go-around in a late stage phase of landing would have created a dangerous situation and complete loss of separation between the two aircraft. If the Tower Controller "aims" for that close of spacing between arriving and departing traffic, then I believe that their safety mindset and ATC aircraft separation requirements need to be revisited for safety reasons.				Air carrier First Officer reported they touched down only seconds after a departing aircraft lifted off the runway. Reporter stated that ATC cleared the departure for takeoff with inadequate separation which could have put the two aircraft in unsafe proximity to each other in the event of a go-around.

Shortly after it stayed on with a HYD light. We looked up and noticed the ENG1 low pressure light and referenced the QRH which instructed us to turn it off. We called Dispatch and Maintenance Control and came to an agreement that with the psi still showing 3000 it was most likely a bad quantity sensor and we continued. About 45 min to an hour later we got both low pressure lights indicating a loss of system A. Again referencing the QRH we followed the procedure. It was as at that time that we decided to divert to ZZZ and [requested priority handling]. We were very aware of our max landing weight and took extra precautions to land under max landing weight. I as the flying pilot made an uneventful landing and came to a stop on the runway here Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was rolled and Maintenance installed the gear pins as directed by the QRH and towed us to the gate. As this was my second leg off OE I was very familiar with this situation from the sim and never got out of performing normally.

We were asked to provide our best forward speed on arrival. We slowed to 250 kts below 10K and then slowed to 210 kts at ZZZZZ1. We were cleared for the approach XXR passing ZZZZZ2. Approach asked us to maintain 170 kts until a 5-mile final. Prior to the turn on to the LOC the CA turned off the autopilot and stated he was going to NAV to the final approach course. After arriving on final the CA asked me to arm the LOC and LOC was captured. At that point the CA turned off the auto thrust. At approximately 2000 agl the CA called for flaps 3 APPR arm and managed speed. I did not understand the "managed speed" and asked him to repeat what he said. I selected flaps 3 and armed the approach. We had the speed brake out and were descending to capture the glide path. We flew below the glide path and still had the speed brake extended. The CA asked again for managed speed, and I selected managed speed. At that point we received a "Speed, speed" warning and a "Glide path, glidepath" warning. The CA executed a go around at approximately 1000 AGL. We did not execute the go-around. I was coordinating with Tower for our climb out instructions and was asked why we executed a go around. We were told to fly 190 heading and maintain 3000 msl. The CA asked me to reprogram the approach. While reprogramming the approach XXR the CA asked for the after TO checklist. I read the after TO checklist and said the gear was up when it was down. We cleaned up the flaps on schedule as to not overspeed anything. We then continued for an uneventful approach and landing on XXR ZZZ.				A320 First Officer reported that during approach the aircraft descended below glide path and a speed warning annunciated. Flight crew conducted a go-around and returned to landing.

On taxi out to the runway, everything was normal and the aircraft was properly configured for takeoff - the flaps were set to 5, the parking brake released, the spoiler handle down and the trim set in the green band. When TOGA was pressed we immediately got a takeoff configuration horn and we subsequently rejected the takeoff around 40 knots. We then got a Master Caution Proximity Electronics Unit (PSEU) light on the overhead panel. After we exited the runway we double checked to make sure the plane was properly configured and we both agreed it was. We called Maintenance Control and they told us to return to the gate and have the plane looked at. While investigating the issue maintenance determined the speed brake lever caused the takeoff configuration horn. It was passing the tests and the plane was going to be returned to service. While looking at the speed brake handle closer at the gate the Captain noticed a tiny part hanging from the base of the speed brake handle. We showed maintenance and they determined it was part of the micro switch for the speed brake handle that had broken away and likely caused our erroneous takeoff configuration warning. From our understanding, maintenance fixed this issue and was later returned to service. The likely cause of our erroneous takeoff configuration warning was a broken micro switch on the speed brake handle. Following SOPs, verifying configuration as a crew and making sure both crew members are fit to fly are the best mitigation for takeoff configuration warnings.				B737-800 pilot crew reported a takeoff configuration micro switch malfunctioned causing a warning and a rejected takeoff.

A moment or two later, I again quickly crosschecked the engine display. When I returned to the airspeed indicator, I observed 125 KIAS. I crosschecked that with the Captain's and noted the same on his side, then made the '100 knots' callout (assuming my crosscheck that day was just slower than usual). I added 'that was late, sorry.' But as my scan went to the ISFD (Integrated Standby Flight Display) (standby instrument) the CA and I both noticed approximately 85 knots indicated (a discrepancy of 40 knots slow). We rejected the takeoff via the QRC then QRH procedures. We interpolated the checklist to see that we were right on the edge of the Warning zone for brake temperatures. We elected to have fire response come out and take brake temperatures out of an abundance of caution. They informed us of 715° as the hottest. (In debrief, CA reported that my late callout caused him to increase the vigilance of his scan and then he noticed our large airspeed discrepancy. I'm still not sure if my crosscheck was just slow or the airspeed jumped quickly on us while I was glancing at the engine display. We taxied back to the gate after talking to Ops and Maintenance. Maintenance informed us to leave the brakes off when chocked. We later saw a new Maintenance write up that this aircraft was a repeat offender for a 40 knot airspeed discrepancy on the ISFD.		FO was 2nd trip off IOE. During flight preparation, a maintenance entry was noted that stated "A/S (Airspeed) flag shows on standby ATT (Attitude Indicator)". The write up was closed with a CB (Circuit Breaker) cycle and noted that the flag had disappeared". This didn't stand out at the time. Captain was PF, FO was PM.The initial takeoff was normal. 100KIAS on the Captain PFD (Primary Flight Display) passed without the "100 knot" call being made by the PM (probably due to him digesting the indication disagreement). I glanced over to cross check the ISFD (Integrated Standby Flight Display) (standby) airspeed and found substantial disagreement (low indication), then further checked the FO PFD airspeed which agreed with the CA side. I made a decision to reject the takeoff. My delay while analyzing the problem took us to a 125 knot reject speed. I had briefed the FO that in the event of a rejected takeoff to back me up on all the mechanical steps, make the 80 knot call, then announce the reject to ATC. In this case, the Tower noticed the reject very quickly and the pilot initiated ATC call became unnecessary. I had also briefed that in the event of a high speed reject or any fire indication for the FO to request ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) with the ATC call. The fact that ATC initiated the call first, threw us off that plan. I was aware that the call for ARFF hadn't been made but I also felt that this really wasn't that high-energy of a stop and thus wasn't urgent. I exited the runway on a high-speed taxiway and stopped on the parallel taxiway. After executing the QRC/QRH and referencing the brake cooling chart, we found ourselves in the Caution area but very close to the Warning area. We had a discussion and decided to err on the side of safety and call ARFF for an inspection. ARFF arrived quickly and found no smoke/fire/damage. They took infrared brake temp readings at our request and we passed that and all other pertinent info along to ZZZ Hub Maintenance who recommended a return to gate at that time. Airport Ops followed us to the gate. After the parking checklist was complete, we debriefed the event, made the required ELB (Electronic Logbook) entries, debriefed with Hub Maintenance, Dispatch, then called the Chief Pilot. A report was filed. As an additional note, I conducted a post-flight inspection of the pitot tubes and found no visible obstruction. Post-flight we discovered another entry made for this even by (I'm assuming) Maintenance Control in the ELB log that stated this was a repeat writeup (specifically the ISFD airspeed reading slow). The only relevant maintenance history we saw during preflight was the ISFD airspeed flag which was cleared by power-cycling. So perhaps there was more history than we were able to see from the app and app interface. The single writeup on the ISFD airspeed flag didn't stand out to me enough to include it in the threat-forward brief. It looked too much like other spurious faults that are commonly cleared in this age of magic by power-cycling. Perhaps if I had put more weight on that detail, I could have shortened the problem analysis time and executed the reject sooner.		B737 flight crew reported airspeed indicator disagreements and late airspeed callout, resulted in a high speed rejected takeoff. Crew reported this was a recurring maintenance event.

He transferred control of the aircraft to me while he attempted to close it. He realized he couldn't close it because his headset cord got stuck in the track and by then we were already in the high speed regime. Since his headset cord was snapped in half he was unable to communicate through our radios and was unable to be heard over the wind. We continued the takeoff and leveled off at 4000 with gear and flaps down. I notified ATC that we need some time to run through things and that we were not declaring an emergency. The CA and I were able to communicate through pen and paper that I would keep the airplane and the radios while the CA checked in with Flight Attendants. After checking in with the Flight Attendants the CA started working on his window and was able to remove the cord and close the window. We reassessed the situation and felt that with the aircraft returned to normal and us both feeling well we could continue but after reevaluating with flight attendants the state of the cabin seemed to be under duress so we decided to return to the field. We burned fuel for 25 minutes and landed without any issues.		Captain takeoff. During preflight I checked for full operation of the window, opening and closing. On take off roll at approximately 80 knots Captain's window came open violently and severed Captain's headset cord. Wind noise was relatively light at the time so I transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer and attempted to close the window. Unbeknownst to me the remainder of my headset cord was jammed in the window track, so I was unable to close the window. I returned focus on the takeoff roll and we were already in the high speed regime, so I elected to continue the takeoff. First Officer took off normally, and climbed to 4000 feet, and let ATC know we had a problem and might have to return so we descended back to 3000'. At that point it was too loud in the flight deck and I was writing notes to the First Officer to communicate. I attempted to close the window again and was unable to. I communicated to the First Officer that we were going to return immediately and called up the Flight Attendants to inform them that my window was open and I couldn't get it closed and we would be on the ground in about 10 minutes, and asked if they could let the passengers know since the flight deck was extremely loud. I started set up the aircraft for arrival and informed Dispatch. We were straight and level with the autopilot engaged so I took the opportunity to try and close the window one last time. I saw that the problem was part of my headset cord (specifically the battery pack) was jammed in the track so I gave that a good tug and pulled it loose and was able to close the window. At that point I tugged on the window firmly and was confident it was seated properly and pressurization was already keeping it from coming open again. I felt comfortable continuing the flight but after discussing it with the flight attendants, many people in the cabin were very unsettled and extremely nervous about continuing, so I elected to return to ZZZ. I didn't feel an overweight landing was justified at that point so we burned off fuel for approximately 25 minutes and landed 40 flap to be more gentle on the brakes, approximately 1000# below maximum landing weight and taxied in uneventfully.		B737 flight crew reported the Captain's window opened on takeoff and a headset cord was lodged in the window track. After removing the cord and closing the window a return to the departure airport was made due to passenger duress.

There was 39% fluid remaining with a loss rate of about .01 per 10 min. We determined the loss rate would not allow continued flight into oceanic airspace. Consulted with Dispatch and Maintenance Control for the best diversion airport. Maintenance Control cautioned do not let the hydraulic pumps run dry as it could cause a fire. We [requested priority handling] and received clearance directly to ZZZZ. Although low pressure had not developed on the right hydraulic system yet, after consulting with the crew, I elected to turn off the pumps to retain as much fluid as possible. We briefed loss of right hydraulic conditions for the landing. With 37% fluid remaining, on final approach, pumps were switched on for a normal landing. ZZZZ safety checked aircraft after landing, finding no issues we taxied to the gate.Cause: As pilot in command (PIC) I made the decision to turn off the pumps before low pressure developed.

After discussion we decided to Monitor, get the checklist ready and begin looking for possible diversion airports. We also sent a message of Dispatch to keep them informed. Shortly thereafter the quantity dropped to 5, the reverse coloring appeared on the display and we began to notice a fluctuation of about + - 10 PSI of the oil pressure. We [notify ATC of our situation] and requested to vectors to ZZZ. I began to read the Low Oil Quantity Checklist but had to discontinue it due to our close proximity to ZZZ and the amount of tasks left to handle. The quantity dropped to 4 just a minute or two after and the Captain asked me to [request priority handling]. We were given radar vectors to ZZZ. The Captain continued to fly and communicate with FAs (Flight Attendant) and PAX (Passengers) while I handled ATC, Dispatch and the box. Dispatch was able to send us a release and weather for ZZZ. All normal checklists were completed on schedule. As we were below 10000ft, the quantity dropped to 1qt. I elected to have the ENG Shutdown checklist up on my iPad ready if we have to shutdown. We also started the APU. We quickly discussed the possibility of delay vectors if we had to shutdown but continued towards the airport. At some point below 1000ft the oil quantity blanked out. We touched down shortly after uneventfully and ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was waiting for us. Once we exited the runway they approached the aicraft and confirmed oil streaks along ENG 1. We shutdown the ENG immediately upon confirmation. We taxied to Gate XX and accomplished normal shutdown procedures. After shut we noticed that Oil quantity on ENG 1 increased to 3qts. The difficulty with an unplanned diversion and lack of time cannot be overlooked. It was difficult to accomplish all tasks in a short amount of time. It also felt like we were racing against the oil quantity. I feel that one thing we could have done to help the situation was reduce ENG 1 to idle. That may have bought us some more time and reduced the "racing" or "running out of time" feelings I'm sure we were both feeling. The idea had come through my mind but I didn't speak up as we were both heavily task saturated and I did not want to stress the Captain any more.				B737 First Officer reported loss of engine oil quantity during cruise. Flight crew diverted and after landing found evidence of oil leak.

[Requested priority handling] with ATC and completed flight manual procedures followed a mostly uneventful overweight single engine landing at ZZZ on Runway XXL. Aircraft was stopped on the runway and immediately visually inspected by ZZZ Fire Fighting. After verifying no externally visual issues the aircraft was taxied to the gate for normal shutdown and passenger deplaning. FO was PF and did a superb job. ATC used a single frequency for approach, landing, Fire Fighting and Taxi which was a great help in reducing workload. It's important to note that the airframe vibrations noted above were very mild and the engine overheat indication was a mild EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) exceedance. Immediately after the engine was secured all abnormal engine indications and very mild airframe vibration ceased. Also, as the CA, I made the decision to make the FO the PF for the single engine landing not because he was the PF when the event happened, but because it was the best decision in this situation. I would have assumed PF duties if at any time I felt this particular FO was not up to the task, but he most definitely was up to the task in this situation. This allowed me to better monitor aircraft systems while completing all required checklist items and communicate the situation to all entities, both inside and outside the aircraft. We train this way at [our] Company and that training paid off.		Right engine failure during climb around 10,000 feet. 250 knots indicated. Normal climb power. [Requested priority handling]. QRC/QRH procedures completed. Smooth successful single engine landing at ZZZ on RWY XXL.		B737 flight crew reported engine failure and airframe vibrations during climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and performed a single-engine landing.

The first officer and I would describe the abnormality as if you were to abruptly step on the left rudder pedal and create a quick, hard yaw to the left. There were no ECAM notifications and we checked that there were no abnormalities to any of the system pages.  The only "normal" indication we noticed was whenever the aircraft yawed to the left, the rudder on the flight control page respectively moved with it.  The yawing moment started out with a frequency of every 10-15 seconds and our concern grew as the frequency became closer together.  The first officer took over the flight controls and radios and I called dispatch to notify them of the abnormality.  They instructed us to check both autopilots and manual flight and unfortunately the condition continued.  After disconnecting with dispatch, the frequency continued and we decided the safest option was to divert to the closest airport.  I spoke with flight attendants asking if they felt the disturbance and they said they felt it but wasn't that aggressive in the cabin.  ZZZ was roughly 50-60NM off our nose so we started the diversion by notifying ATC, going through the diversion checklist, notifying dispatch via ACARS, setting up for the approach, notifying the customers and briefing the flight attendants if condition escalated.  Due to it not being a flight control malfunction we did not [request priority handling] but notified ATC that it was an abnormality and we wanted CFR (crash fire rescue) as a precaution.  We landed with no incident and taxied safely to the gate in ZZZ.				A320 pilot reported the aircraft began to produce a yawing moment during cruise which continued to increase in frequency. Flight diverted and landed safely.

The PF was the FO. The CA and FO both were utilizing Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) procedures and independently set the altimeter setting on descent. They both independently set the wrong altimeter setting. I did not catch the error as I was attempting to tune and turn on the pilot controlled lighting at the field. They made all the correct altimeter related call outs to include the FAF crossing which they called accurate/checked. However the altimeter was set with the incorrect information and we were low on profile. This caused a low terrain warning on approach and a subsequent go-around. Further ops were normal.				A330 Captain reported crew set incorrect altimeter setting resulted in low altitude alert and a CFTT event.

Noted RA compared to Altimeter was at 2500 on first automated audible as well as at FAF and 1000' were consistent as a carry over from 5G AMOC (Alternate Means of Compliance) procedures however in review noted that the normal splits observed at those positions did not exist (first non-OEM procedure opportunity to trap an error in altimeter settings). The altimeter observation at FAF was exactly 2,300' as published. PAPI showed solidly 2-white/2-red. The outline of the hill was observable and the flight path trajectory appeared to clear the hill; however, the flight path angle seemed a little flat (second non-OEM procedure opportunity to trap an error in altimeter settings). Approaching the hill the PAPI trended toward 4-red but all electronic guidance appeared normal (third non-OEM procedure opportunity to trap an error in altimeter settings). Even when on the appropriate glide path, the PAPI in ZZZ is well known to show pink instead of white on a very consistent basis presumably due to refraction of the light due to moisture conditions, thus this non-normal PAPI presentation has become normalized. As we approached the ridge of the hill we received a GPWS alert TOO LOW TERRAIN and immediately executed a missed approach. Obtained a new updated METAR, corrected the BARO (barometric) settings, and executed another approach without further incident. Had we not executed the missed approach we likely would have crossed the top of the hill at 165' AGL however the actual minimum RA was not noted. The lowest RA I observed was above 300'.				A330 pilot reported receiving an aircraft terrain alert during approach and executing a missed approach.

During the prior day's flight, we operated under two lav-associated MELs.MEL XXXXT (Defect: Forward lav waste blower inop with Circuit Breaker (CB) Z-1ON P110 PNL popped; vacuum blower(s) inoperative and deactivated. Associated lavatories will not flush on the ground or in the air below 16,000' Actions - associated lavs mut remain secured closed on the ground and below 16,000'; above 16,000' advise FAs to unlock lavs; before descent below 16,000' advise FAs to lock all (associated) lavs). The following toilets inoperative below 16,000': 1R, 3LC, 4R.MEL XXXXL (Defect: One or more lavatory toilet flush system(s) inoperative and deactivated. Associated lavatory(ies) is not useable. Toilet 1R will not flush. Note we called station operations at ZZZ1 prior to departure In Accordance With (IAW) MEL to 'confirm with station control that approval for flight has been obtained from Company Communications System - operations manager.' We were told by ZZZ1 station ops that the flight was approved.During the flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ, all toilets operated as advertised with MELs (1R was blocked off, and would not flush, 4R and 3LC were blocked off below 16,000' but were used and operated above 16,000').For the event flight, the initial release (XXXX Release 1) included both MELs (XXXXT and XXXXL). However, prior to pushback, the release was updated (XXXX Release 2) for removal of MEL XXXXT, but MEL XXXXL remained in effect. This meant there was no longer a blower restriction and only toilet 1R was inoperative and blocked off/closed because it would not flush. We called ZZZ station operations IAW MEL to 'confirm with station control that approval for flight has been obtained from Company Communications System - operations manager.' We were told by ZZZ station ops that the flight was approved and the ops manager's initials were 'Taxiway 1 2.'While in cruise after departing ZZZ, FAs called CA to report that only 2 toilets were working (one at 4R and one of the three at 3), all other toilets would not flush (with bowls full), with long passenger lines for the two operating toilets. Another call back from the FAs a couple minutes later clarified that there were three working toilets; one at 4R and two at 3 (3L and 3C; 3R was inoperative). Later (after we had talked to Maintenance Control and trouble shot the issue) the FAs called again to state only two toilets operating, 4R and 3LC.The Captain called Dispatch and had a patch with Maintenance Control to relay the issue. Maintenance Control suggested that we try to close the manual valve for one of the inoperative toilets and then try the other inoperative toilets to see if that restored operation. If operation was not restored, we were to return the manual valve to its original position, and then try moving the valve on another inoperative toilet, and again checking if operation was restored on the other toilets. The CA took over all flying duties and I went to the cabin to attempt Maintenance Control's fix. I first moved the manual valve at 1L and then checked inoperative toilet operation, starting at 3R (1R would not flush in any case and was not to be used per MEL XXXXL). No toilet function was restored. Due to the time required to move a valve (one at a time) and then check remaining toilet operation, I showed one FA how to accomplish the procedure, then had her demonstrate the procedure to me and returned to the flight deck while she trouble shot the remaining inoperative toilets. The trouble shooting resulted in no change - no toilet operation was restored and it appeared only the toilets at 3LC and 4R were working. We also learned from Maintenance Control that the operating toilets were all using the same waste tank - 'Waste tank 1.' While trouble shooting the toilets I also viewed the Lavatory/Waste tank status page and observed that the waste tank 1 was 'yellow' and indicating approximately 3/8 full. Tanks 2 and 3 were indicating completely empty.During the trouble shooting period we continued on course passing ZZZ2. CA and I talked about diversion options and considered ZZZ2 and ZZZ3. Maintenance Control advised that for the number of passengers (>300), the single waste tank might have enough capacity for us to continue to ZZZ1. However, at the same time, the FAs were expressing that the passengers were becoming very impatient and upset with the situation, that there were as many as XX people in line to use the lavs and that they were 'nearing a mutiny.' The CA and I agreed that the safest and most caring course of action was to divert. While it was possible that the single waste tank might not be the limiting factor, the long lines of passengers waiting to use the lavs was not ideal. We also agreed that continuing to ZZZ3 versus turning around to ZZZ2 was the best option (we were slightly closer to, but past ZZZ2 at the point of decision).CA told dispatch the plan, then briefed FAs, then made a PA to the passengers. We then advised ATC and received clearance to ZZZ3. We prepared for the arrival, approach, and landing and reviewed the diversion guide. The rest of the flight was uneventful. Accomplished diversion recovery guide at ZZZ3 and accomplished flight to ZZZ1 from ZZZ3.In hindsight, I'm not sure why the MEL for the inoperative blower (XXXXT) was removed between release 1 and release 2 - I question if it (blower) really was really fixed as these associated toilets (with the exception of 1R for known inop flush) were the only toilets that seemed to work.In order to secure their turn for the limited lavatory use, passengers were cueing at the toilets. While we were fortunate to have a smooth ride, had there been turbulence, this could have been a safety issue with passengers deciding using the lav was more critical than remaining seated with the seatbelt fastened. Another consideration for operating with limited lavs - but not something we foresaw on this flight as the MEL in effect (XXXXL) was only for a single inoperative toilet.				B777 First Officer reported several lavatories on the aircraft became inoperative during cruise in addition to those already on MEL. Flight crew diverted, then completed flight to original destination.

We were following the visual approach to Runway XX, and ATC instructed us to maintain 170 knots until 5 nautical miles (NM) from the Runway.During the arrival phase, we were cleared for an unrestricted descent to 2500 feet. The FO ( pilot flying) selected level change to manage the descent. Approximately at 3000 feet, we received a vector to intercept for our approach. Pilot flying selected. L-NAV to fly direct to ZZZZZ (IF) and then engaged V-NAV, to which I (Pilot Monitoring) saw the FO pressing the button but did not confirm the engagement with the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA). First Officer missed double checking VNAV activation because he was trying to get configure to flaps 40 while ATC had requested 170kt till 5NM.The FO set the altitude to 500 feet, which was immediately corrected to 600 feet by me to ensure it met the Minimums (550 feet).As we continued descending and configuring the aircraft, we were running the landing checklist. I was heads down while the FO was flying the aircraft. At around 900 feet, ATC called our flight number and followed with a low altitude alert. Shortly thereafter, a GPS Warning (GPSW) alert appeared. The FO had disengaged the autopilot and leveled off the aircraft at this point.ATC instructed us to continue the approach and expect landing clearance short final.At all times we were in visual conditions and were able to continue the approach safely. I noticed that VNAV was not active, so I worked to re-engage VNAV and ensure proper vertical guidance. We received landing clearance and successfully landed at ZZZ.Cause: The landing checklist and aircraft configuration tasks led to a temporary lack of situational awareness regarding altitude and VNAV status. The original FO reported fatigue due to extremely loud conditions at the hotel the night before, and while I (Captain) did not specifically call out fatigue, I also did not have a good night's sleep, which may have affected overall alertness and performance. The busy nature of the ATC workload, particularly with vectoring and managing multiple aircraft, may have contributed to the timing and frequency of instructions and alerts, potentially affecting our response and situational awareness. With ATCs request to maintain 170kt until 5NM, getting configured was a worry both pilots had. Upon noticing VNAV was inactive, I promptly worked to re-engage VNAV and ensure proper vertical guidance. We maintained visual reference and continued the approach safely, leading to a successful landing.Suggestions: Complete checklists and aircraft configuration tasks with minimal distraction and ensure continuous situational awareness, especially during critical phases of flight. Autopilot and VNAV Monitoring: Ensure proper engagement and monitoring of autopilot LNAV and VNAV systems to prevent altitude deviations and potential alerts. Maintain awareness of minimums and approach altitudes throughout the approach phase to avoid altitude-related alerts. Address and mitigate factors contributing to fatigue, including ensuring adequate rest and reporting any fatigue-related issues that may affect performance. Consider enhanced coordination and communication with ATC, particularly during busy phases, to ensure clear and effective handling of instructions and alerts. The approach and landing were completed safely despite the low altitude and GPS warnings. The prompt re-engagement of VNAV and continued visual guidance by pilot flying ensured a successful outcome. Addressing fatigue, improving alertness, and managing ATC workload can further enhance overall performance and safety.				Air carrier flight crew reported while on a visual approach they descended below the glide path resulting with ATC issuing a low altitude alert and flying towards terrain. The flight crew rejoined the glide path and landed safely at the airport.

We operated ZZZ1 to ZZZ to ZZZ2 to ZZZ3 (diversion). When we diverted to ZZZ3 due to ZZZ weather, our duty period was not going to allow us to refuel and depart to ZZZ. The FO and I agreed to a FDP (Flight Duty Period) extension.We knew there was a significant line of convective weather along the route to ZZZ. Once airborne, we used onboard radar in conjunction with WSI (Weather App), FDPro, and ATC to evaluate the weather confronting us. Initially we considered a gap a little north of our route. As we neared the target gap, it became apparent that we could not safely pass though. The gap had 70,000' cells on either side, both producing hail, one of which was moving towards the gap. Time for a new plan. Further discussion and data evaluation lead us about 50 miles southwest towards a gap that was larger than the first one. It looked like a passable route based on information we gathered.For a 2nd time, I called the flight attendants and advised them "Moderate turbulence procedures in effect until I call back", I also made a PA to the passengers that turbulence is expected and they must absolutely remain seated. I expected turbulence to be present, but brief, between cells. The line of storms was wide, but not particularly deep.As we neared the second possible gap, we reiterated to one another that returning to ZZZ3 was a viable option if we were unable to safely pass through. Using all our sources of information, we decided to fly into the gap between storms and continue to ZZZ. Airspeed was decreased and we made a right turn towards the west-northwest to enter the gap.Almost immediately, we encountered turbulence, hail, and lightning. Both front windshields sustained damage. The autopilot did not self disconnect. Non-Normal methodology and the company strategy were utilized per SOP. The inner portion of both windshields were confirmed smooth. The QRH procedure indicated no limitations for this condition. Once we were clear of the weather and the non normal situation stabilized, I [advised ATC] and requested direct to ZZZ. As a precaution, we descended to 11,000.I informed Dispatch of our situation via the app. I briefed flight attendants on what happened and what to expect with our precautionary landing. The CA windshield sustained minimal damage so it was decided that I would assume PF duties prior to approach. After crew discussion, we setup and briefed an autoland approach to Runway XXC. The autoland approach would serve as an added barrier in case the CA windshield degraded and became obstructed during approach, landing, or rollout.Weather was VFR in ZZZ. The autoland approach to XXC was completed. We waited a while for a gate once on the ground. I used the Tarmac Delay app to track this delay and comply with necessary actions. Parked at the gate, logbook entries completed. Report completed. Presently, no injuries reported.Cause: It was a long day. Fatigue was starting to become a factor. I suspect we traveled further south than desired while in the right turn to enter the gap. I considered intervening by turning off the AP (Autopilot) and increasing bank, but I felt the added risk of potentially entering the storm at 67 degrees of bank with AP off outweighed the benefit.				A320 Captain reported a windshield malfunction during cruise after flying near an area of turbulence, hail, and lightning. Both front windshields sustained damage and the flight landed safely.

First two legs were uneventful.  After we held for a few minutes, we diverted to ZZZ3 on the ZZZ2-ZZZ1 leg due to weather conditions at ZZZ1 during our landing time.  Given that our 12 hour duty period was ending and the refuel and redispatch was quick, the CA and I agreed to a short FDP (Flight Duty Period) extension.During our ZZZ3-ZZZ1 preflight discussion and briefing, we noted the line of convective weather which stretched from the northeast to at least northern Location A and it was moving northeast.  Our original route of flight was ZZZ [VOR] ZZZZZ.  The WSI (Weather App) and other apps showed a gap in the weather on this route.  Once we were airborne, we used the radar, discussion with ATC as well as the aforementioned apps and determined that the gap in the weather on the ZZZZZ arrival was not sufficient and the cells were in excess of our ability to climb over them.We discussed our options and using the information from WSI, apps and ATC, we decided to try for a gap that was approximately 50 miles southwest of our position, near ZZZ4.  If it was not passable, then return to ZZZ3.  This gap appeared to be larger than the first gap based on what the radar was showing as well as the apps.  As we approached the gap, I noticed another aircraft on TCAS 1000feet above us proceeding into the gap we were trying for.  I briefed the captain that I intended to turn the aircraft towards the gap and evaluate the radar return and if it changed for the worse from what we were currently seeing, that I would turn around to avoid any severe weather.  We also both mentioned that there was no need to push it and that ZZZ3 was a suitable alternate with no significant weather near it.The CA notified the FAs (Flight Attendants) that moderate turbulence procedures were in effect and he made a PA to the passengers to expect turbulence and remain seated with seatbelts on.   As I turned the aircraft towards the gap, I slowed the aircraft for turbulence and checked the radar for significant changes in the return.  Almost immediately we encountered lightning, turbulence and hail.  Both front windshields were cracked.  The autopilot remained on throughout the turbulence.  We used the non-normal methodology and strategized to work towards a course of action.  We noted that neither windshield had cracks on the inside; they were both smooth using the fingernail test.  Given this, the QRH noted that there were no limitations for this condition.  When we cleared the weather and the situation was stable, the CA [advised ATC] and requested direct to ZZZ1.  We descended to 11,000 feet out of an abundance of caution.  Additionally, we decided that the CA would take the landing since his windscreen had better visibility/less cracks and we set up for an Autoland approach in case the CA windscreen cracked more.  The captain spoke to dispatch and the FAs.  I monitored the engine parameters to ensure no rise or fluctuations in vibes or EGTs as I continued to fly.The CA executed an Autoland in VFR conditions, we taxied clear of the runway and had a lengthy tarmac delay (over X hour and XXmins).  To my knowledge,  no injuries were reported.Cause: Severe weather and potential loss of situation awareness of the true extent of the weather.  While the CA and I used all available information at hand to make the decision to try for the gap in the weather near ZZZ4, we didn't have the specific information regarding the severity of the weather on the exact route of flight.  The lesson learned in this situation is to divert to the stated VFR option instead of trying to pick our way through a line of weather.				A-320 First Officer reported a cracked windshield on both cockpit window outer panes during cruise flight in an area of lightening, turbulence, and hail. The crew performed an autoland at the destination and landed safely.

At 7000 ft ENG 1 surged multiple times with several loud bangs and then stopped. When the engined surged the only indication that I saw fluctuate was N1. The vibration indication stayed right around .4 and all other indications remained normal. Just before glide slope intercept the engine surged again disengaging the autopilot and so immediate actions items were performed. Thrust was reduced till surging subsided and again other than N1 fluctuating all other indications were normal and so the FO continued the approach and landed. After landing we noticed on the overhead panel that the ENG 1 CONTROL light was on. After parking at the gate I contacted Maintenance Control and gave a detailed debrief on what happened. No engine exceedences were observed on the displays. I made the necessary maintenance write up. I also contacted the Chief Pilot out of caution for a debrief.		While being vectored on approach to XXR into ZZZZ, the number 1 engine surged. The engine indications were fluctuating rapidly while we felt momentary jolts and heard bangs from the engine. I began hand flying on the vector inbound and the captain completed the immediate action items. The captain continued to monitor the engine indications while I flew the aircraft. Soon after the jolts, the flight attendants called up to check-in since they felt and heard it in the back. The captain ran through the remainder of the engine surge checklist. Additionally, he input the single-engine missed approach procedure in the fix page for reference. We were cleared for the approach and we did not declare an emergency. After bringing the L engine thrust back to its engine indication's normal levels, the engine remained stable. We landed and during the taxi noticed the number 1 engine control light was illuminated. Once at the gate, the captain called Maintenance Control as well as the Chief Pilot and submitted a maintenance write-up. Station operations met us at the aircraft and were told of the write-up as well.		A Boeing 737 flight crew reported the #1 engine surged several times during the approach phase of flight, which necessitated reducing power on the engine for the remainder of the approach and landing.

As I advanced the throttles I called for check thrust, the FO said thrust checked at that time the aircraft veered right and I heard 2 bangs and an Engine fail EICAS at about 40-50 KTS with a shaking to the aircraft. After applying the brakes and centering the plane on the runway we came to at stop, my report made an announcement to remain seated on the PA. I looked down at the engine indications and everything was normal with both engines running. My FO told the tower we had rejected on runway XX and told them we would like to taxi off the runway, they asked if we needed any assistance and with everything being normal she said not at this time. We ran the checklist, called the flight attendants to see if they had anything in the cabin they said they heard the loud bangs but everything was okay back there. We taxied off Taxiway 1 and stopped on Taxiway 2 as instructed by tower we took a deep breath and accessed the situation, my FO stayed with tower my report talked to the FAs and I called Dispatch with a phone patch to Maintenance Control, they confirmed we had an engine surge and engine fail. They recommended going back to a gate we coordinated with operations and taxied to handstand, the right engine would start getting to approach over temperature with any input so I taxied with 1 engine. We all commented that it seemed like a perfect solution to a problem. Mechanics came on board looked at the bleed valves and told us that they needed to do more work and it could be days to repair the problem. My report and myself made several announcements keeping the passengers and flight attendants informed.				B777 Captain reported an engine failure during takeoff roll.

Start and taxi normal. Cleared for takeoff on Runway XX, from Taxiway 1. The Capt taxied us onto the Runway, aligned the nose. While holding the breaks, he pushed up the throttles to allow them to stabilize. The left engine was slow to spool up but reached a stabilized setting. The Captain then released the breaks and pushed up the throttles and called to check thrust. I confirmed thrust was set. Shortly after, it felt like we hit a divot in the concrete followed by a loud bang, slight shutter to the right, audible 'Engine Failure', and master warning annunciation and EICAS. We were around 40 kts when this occurred. Pilot Flying initiated the rejection while I called Tower. The Relief Pilot made the 'remain seated' PA. We cleared the Runway and sat on a parallel taxiway while we ran checklists and made radio/phone calls. Maintenance Control said they saw the engine failure in their system. Check-in with the FAs validated the loud bangs and they confirmed no other visual issues with the engine. The engine remained running and only indicated an issue when we began taxing to the hard stand. The EGT would spoil up very quickly and very high, especially in contrast to the left engine. We parked at a hard stand, shutdown and Maintenance began looking into the issue while we coordinated to get the Passengers back to the terminal. Capt did a fantastic job delegating duties and keeping everyone informed. Training definitely kicked in as designed.				B777 First Officer reported an engine malfunction st the start of the takeoff roll. The takeoff was rejected and the aircraft taxied to parking.

At about 1,500 feet the nose gear and right main gear were down. However, we got an indication that the left gear door was open. That was followed by the left gear showing unlocked on both the ECAM and landing gear panel.At this time, we advised the tower we would like to execute a missed approach. We had several seconds to discuss what we would do and then we went around. We elected to keep the landing gear down. On the go-round, tower, advised us that the left gear did look down. Also while on the go-around, the left gear door closed and the left gear went from unlocked to down and locked and green.Who are you contacted ZZZ departure and they vectored us for a close and left downwind. ZZZ1 Tower was able to visually inspect our gear and didn't say it. It looked down. We continued on and landed visually in ZZZ1 with no further incident.However, after landing, received a caution for landing gear system disagree. I wrote this all up in the logbook and maintenance met the aircraft at the gate.				A320 flight crew on final approach reported main gear not down and locked.

We were able to stop the aircraft just as we entered the high speed exit but were not clear of the runway.After maintenance came out to inspect the aircraft, they stated the control arm pin was missing and the nose gear assembly was cocked 90 degrees. There were no cockpit indications that there was a failure of any systems prior to landing or after we stopped.		Captain made normal landing and touchdown. On rollout, we heard a clanging noise and verbally both acknowledged it. As the aircraft rolled towards the M4 high speed on [Runway] XXC, we heard a 'clang' and began to feel vibrations and heard thumping noises coming from the nose wheel. Captain verbalized he had lost nosewheel steering, so I came on the brakes with him, putting in full right rudder and both brakes. The vibrations and noises intensified as the aircraft rolled to a stop prior to the end of the pavement. We had made it about halfway through the turn on to M4 when the aircraft finally stopped. Captain made a prompt PA for the passengers to remain seated, and I made a call to tower to let them know we lost nosewheel steering and were stopped on the high speed. Trailing traffic was told to go-around and tower asked if we could move forward. Captain attempted to roll the aircraft forward and right to clear the runway, but we immediately stopped it when the vibration and thumping occurred again. I told tower that we could not clear the runway, and advised that I thought there was damage to the nosewheel, alerting them to the potential of FOD on the active runway. We coordinated with Tower, Port Control and OPS to have a maintenance inspection done, deplane the passengers, and get the aircraft towed to the hangar.Mechanical failure. Cause of the failure is unknown.		B737-800 crew reported a loss of control during landing rollout.  Crew reported nose-wheel steering failed along with noise/vibrations from nose-wheel area requiring a tow to gate.

When doing this I noticed that our pressure differential was into the amber band. I asked the Captain if this was normal as I have never seen this before on any aircraft type that I have flown. We then referenced the QRH only to find that there was no procedure for this issue. We referenced the limitation section of the Flight Manual, the plane had exceeded the pressure differential limit. We were around 100 or so miles from entering class II airspace and opted to do a hold to stay within the vicinity of ZZZ in case we needed to divert as well as stay in radio and radar range. At this point we spilt the flight deck, I remained pilot flying and took over the radios while the Captain contacted ops. Between talking with ATC when the worked load permitted, I would listen to the conversation between the Captain and operations. I was shocked to hear that they wanted us to continue to ZZZ1. I did not chime in, but I was completely floored that this was what we were told to do. The Captain repeatedly stated that you are asking us to fly with a known problem one that could lead to a structural issue which could cause a rapid decompression. While this is happening, we continued to request lower altitudes due the continued rise in differential pressure. After the Captain talked with Ops he concluded the radio patch and fully updated me on what was said. I only heard small parts on the conversation as I was only able to listen for a very short amount of time due to my workload as PF and talking to ATC. The Captain then said that they told us that we can continue to ZZZ1 with this pressurization problem. I asked the Captain why are you going back and forth with them you know what the right answer is. I feel he only second guessed his right decision for just a few moments due to the fact (we were told it was OK). There seemed to be a tone of pressure to complete this flight.  We exited the hold, another patch was made, and we were told to climb back up to our cruise altitude because this would allow for enough fuel to complete the flight to ZZZ1. I cannot understand why the captain is being told that it is OK to fly the plane with a known problem. The flight routing, the issue with the pressurization, the type of navigation all points to this is not a good idea. Continuing the flight to ZZZ1 only would have open the door for a multitude of problems that could have ended horribly. Once on the ground in ZZZ2, Maintenance told us there was an issue with the outflow valve, pressure controller computer and some grounding wires. They also stated that we would not have been good to continue to ZZZ1. In later research this same aircraft two days later had another pressurization problem forcing the crew to utilize the manual function of the pressurization panel. I am writing this not for myself and the Captain but for the tech who stated that it was OK to continue to ZZZ1. I feel the advice given was not well thought out. Climbing to a higher altitude with an over pressurized plane would only make the situation worse. If we have limitations in our Flight Manual we should adhere to them and not be told that its OK to continue when there is an exceedance. Safety and precaution should have been the focus.				B737 flight crew reported exceedance of cabin pressure differential limit in cruise. Flight crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

Refer to CA or FO report for more precise info. I had almost started to sleep as relief pilot on first break in the crew rest area, when my fellow Relief Pilot 'wakes' me, and tells me they shut down an engine. He had not yet finished getting ready in his bunk, and re-entered the cockpit before me. I quickly dressed and re-entered the cockpit, hooked up headset, etc. as the CA and FO started the fuel jettison non-normal checklist. They had already shutdown the right engine, etc., before I re-entered the cockpit. I assisted by talking with Dispatch on SATCOM, relaying for crew. We decided not to pass over the suitable alternate of ZZZ. Dispatch provided ZZZ weather, and the previously requested landing data messages (LDM's). Because it took a while before the LDMs showed up on the printer, I referred to the 200B Non-normal landing distance table, calculating for ENG SHUTDOWN L, R (Flaps 20). I rounded up our actual gross weight to 480.0 to minimize extrapolation and derived a required landing distance of 4800 feet. My fellow Relief Pilot Q-C'd my calculation. We were happy I did the calculation, because Dispatch sent up LDMs only for flaps 30 and flaps 25. We compared my number to those from Dispatch for good measure and we agreed autobrakes 4 would be sufficient. (And they were.) I backed up the PF and PM, etc. and conferred with my fellow Relief Pilot as necessary. I also assisted communicating with the purser, updating our status and estimated landing time, etc. Our CRM seemed professional and effective to me and us as a crew. Our training kicked in very nicely. We backed each other up. The CA had set an open tone from the start of our flight brief and maintained it throughout the entire flight. He effectively managed time-critical tasks and delegated appropriately. As a crew we freely tested assumptions amongst each other. ATC; ZZZ tower, ground, all supported us in excellent fashion. Passengers thanked us for getting them to ZZZ safely.		The Relief Pilots had just left to start there break and we had leveled off at FL330. A few minutes had passed and we noticed a high oil temperature warning. Person 1 went to the checklist and started going through the steps. I had brought the thrust lever back slowly but the temperature keep getting hotter. Person 1 and I both looked at each other and decided we needed to land the plane at the nearest suitable airport ZZZ. Person 1 notified ATC we were [requesting priority handling] and going to ZZZ, I call the purser and told her we needed the Relief Pilot back up front and to prepare the cabin for a landing in ZZZ. We followed the checklist. We shut down the engine and started dumping fuel to get below landing weight. I believe it took between 25 and 30 minutes to get everything prepared before I made the landing in ZZZ. We told ATC to have emergency crews standing by. I made a single engine flaps 20 landing. It went smooth and we taxied to the end of the runway and then taxi to the holding area and ground crews had told us there was no fire just a little bit of smoke and a little fluid coming out of the right engine. There was no need to do an evacuation so we asked to passengers to remain seated until we could get things situated.  Coordinated with company to have buses come out to the aircraft and air stairs to deplane passengers which took probably 30 minutes. The crew was awesome!		Air Carrier flight crew reported while in cruise receiving engine oil temperature warning resulting with the air crew landing safely at the first available airport.

We looked for any abnormal which none was found.  The Captain then proceeded to contact Maintenance Control for any ideas.  A short time after at about 36,000 feet we had intense sparks and smoke at which time we donned the oxygen masks, established communication, and ensured the seat belt sign was on.  We decided to immediately divert back to ZZZ.  At this time we noticed the windshield overheat caution light was illuminated at which time we turned off the Captain's windshield heat.  In addition, the Captain notified dispatch, Maintenance Control, and prepared the flight attendants with the brief items.  He also advised the passengers of a mechanical issue and our intention of returning to ZZZ.  We returned to ZZZ without any other further incident.

Very quickly, smoke started appearing in the cockpit through the ceiling vents.  I turned the autopilot and autothrottles off and pulled the #1 thrust lever to idle.  We donned our oxygen masks and [asked for assistance] and requested to land at ZZZ1.  The smoke dissipated within 3 minutes although we could still smell it in the air.  I talked to the flight attendants, and they echoed what we experienced with the smoke in the cockpit - it dissipated quickly.  I tried pushing the #1 thrust lever up slowly and started to experience the vibration again, so I pulled it back to idle and left it there.  We had just passed over ZZZ1 so we were very close to the airport - because of this, there was no need to do a drift down analysis.  Because, in my opinion, [I had] such a sharp First Officer, I felt the safest course of action was for [them] to continue running the checklists while I flew the airplane and talked to ATC. I felt it would have caused more confusion to transfer controls. We requested a descent and vectors so that we could run checklists and prepare for an approach and landing at the ZZZ1 airport. Once we got the aircraft stabilized in a descent, I called the flight attendants to get a situation report - they assured me everything was good in the cabin.  I made an announcement to the passengers that we would be diverting to ZZZ1.  I also sent a diversion message to dispatch.  I told the FAs that we would stop on the runway and that we would not be evacuating.  We ran the Smoke, Fire or Fumes checklist followed by the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist.  The Smoke, Fire or Fumes checklist is lengthy, but I could see no reason to rush through the checklist since the smoke had dissipated and there was no evidence of a need to rush through any parts of the checklist in order to land more quickly.  Rushing is always a threat to safety so I did not want myself or [the F/O] to feel rushed. I asked for the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist so that we could start cooling that engine down prior to landing - the oil temperature was higher than normal.  We set up for a Flaps 15, single engine approach to runway XXR in ZZZ1, briefed the approach, and requested vectors to join the final.  Once we were fully configured for landing, I turned the autopilot off.  When I did, the flight directors disappeared from both sides.  It was a clear VFR day, and I was stabilized with the VASI in sight, so I felt the safest course of action was to continue the approach and land without the flight director. It was a stable approach throughout.  We landed in ZZZ1 and stopped on the runway allowing CFR trucks to observe the outside of the aircraft.  When they gave us the 'all clear' we attempted to taxi to the gate.  Unfortunately, one of the brakes had locked up, so we requested a tow tractor to pull us into the gate.  All the passengers were seen by the fire rescue team and no injuries were reported to my knowledge.The causal factor was a problem with the #1 engine.  I don't know how this could have been avoided.		We were passing through approximately 30,000 feet when we heard a loud noise followed by feeling high vibrations from the number one engine. As well as abnormal engine indications on the number one engine, at this moment immediately the cockpit and cabin started filling with smoke with a strong odor. We donned our oxygen masks, The CA turned off the auto-throttles and autopilot and brought the number one engine to idle while we [requested assistance] with ATC, requesting to divert to ZZZ1 airport and performed an descent while checking on the cabin. The smoke started to dissipate within approximately 3 minutes but the strong odor was still present. We performed the fire, smoke and fumes checklist. Starting the descent procedure the CA talked to the flight attendants that told us the same occurred in the cabin as we experienced in the flight deck with the smoke quickly dissipating. We identify the smoke was being caused by abnormal indications, high vibrations from the number 1 engine. The CA and I made the decision to run the engine failure or shutdown checklist. We shut down the number one engine following the completion of the smoke, fire and fumes checklists. We landed on the runway and as we were rolling out Fire and Rescue team reported no fire or smoke from our engines or aircraft. We stopped on the runway so Fire and Rescue team can get a closer look at the number one engine. They gave us the "all clear" to taxi to the gate to let the passengers deplane at the gate for further investigation. Unfortunately when we tried to move under our own power the aircraft did not move and we identified we may have a locked up brake, maintenance team and tow came to tow us to the gate. Once to the gate fire and rescue boarded the aircraft and assisted in the deplaning process. They offered passengers and crew the opportunity to be looked at by fire and rescue team. No injuries were reported to our knowledge. Once at the gate the maintenance team discovered a piece in between the fan blades has come off and damaged the fan blades as well as the outside of the core of the engine.		B737-800 flight crew reported safely diverting to an alternate airport after experiencing #1 engine issues that resulted in an inflight shutdown.

We accomplished the immediate ECAM action items and reviewed the affected aircraft system components.  I made the decision to land the aircraft given the weather conditions (VMC/dry runway) and the runway length for ZZZ XXR (11,000+ feet), our fuel status at the end of a mid-flight reroute (6,000 lbs), and most importantly, the lack of aircraft performance due to the high density altitude at ZZZ and the inability to retract the landing gear (associated with the hydraulic failure) in conjunction with the high terrain surrounding the ZZZ airport.  [Assistance was requested] with the ZZZ Tower and Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) responded to our aircraft.  The landing was accomplished without further incident.  The aircraft was stopped on the runway and our inflight crew members were instructed to remain seated while we coordinated with ATC/CFR and monitored the affected aircraft systems.  The passengers were informed of the situation and the aircraft was towed off the runway and to the gate (due to the loss of steering control associated with the hydraulic failure).  An ACARS message was sent to Dispatch informing them of the situation.				A320 Captain reported landing safely following an ECAM alert for low fluid quantity in the Green hydraulic system.

Since we were so close to the runway, we decided to continue to a landing. During rollout, we then got a light for #2 Electric hydraulic pump (both on system A). Landing rollout was normal, and we exited the runway at the highspeed taxiway 1. Steering and braking were a bit sluggish, but otherwise operable.  We held short of runway XXR for departing traffic. After we were cleared to cross runway XXR, I was unable to turn the tiller, so I stopped the aircraft short of the runway, and set the parking brake.  We informed ATC of our inability to move. Upon checking the SYS page, we noticed that hydraulic system A quantity indicated Zero.  We then informed ZZZ Company X ops that we would require a tow to the gate. While waiting for the tug and maintenance to arrive at the aircraft, a city vehicle approached us an noticed smoke coming from the #2 MLG (suspected to be hydraulic fluid leaking onto hot brakes). We decided to start the APU and shut down the engines. ARFF was dispatched to the aircraft, but no fire was detected. After about 25-30 minutes maintenance and a tug arrived. I handed maintenance the gear pin box through the window, gear pins were installed, then we were towed to the gate. Deplaning of passengers was normal.Cause: Mechanical failure - All parties involved performed required tasks very well.  The only thing that would have made our jobs easier would be for a more detailed QRH procedure for if a loss of hydraulic system occurs on the ground, since the QRH procedure mostly deals with a loss of a system in the air.				B737-800 flight crew reported on final approach receiving master caution warning for low hydraulic pressure resulting with the flight crew landing safely and being towed to the gate.

FO pulled power and cancelled T/O with ZZZ Tower. CA confirmed the light was off with FA1 and obtained T/O clearance from Tower. T/O was uneventful until FA1 called again during cleanup following Climb power setting. FA1 advised CA that the 1R door pressurization light was blinking red. FO continued flying and assumed radio duties while CA continued to obtain info from FA1. CA decided to return to ZZZ due to door issue. CA called dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss options and whether to conduct an overweight landing or burn fuel. After completing a landing assessment and finding the current conditions prohibited a landing option at ZZZ, CA decided to divert to ZZZ1 to avoid weather in the area. Due to runway closures at ZZZ1, CA determined that ZZZ2 was the closest suitable diversion airport. After [requesting priority handling] and taking vectors from ATC to burn down to a suitable landing weight, the FO landed at ZZZ2 without incident.Cause: Future situations like this event that arise while on the runway will result in exiting the runway and waiting on a taxiway to gather more data to confirm that no other issues are present before taking the runway again to depart.		Upon taking the runway for takeoff, FA1 called the flightdeck and said exit lights came on. We stopped the aircraft on the runway and informed the tower that we needed to delay. There were no other associated lights in the flightdeck or in the cabin, and after talking with Person A, and the FO, I continued the takeoff.Reaching 2500 feet MSL, the FA1 informed me that the R1 door red light was flashing at times. It would flash and at periods stop flashing. We leveled the aircraft and informed ATC that we might have a pressurization issue and requested to stay close to ZZZ airport. The FO flew and I began communicating with the FA's and passengers. Afterwards, I called dispatch and maintenance to discuss options. The aircraft did not have a pressurization issue, but decided to divert to ZZZ2 and declared a pan pan. The aircraft continued pressurizing for the entire flight. I informed the crew and passengers that we have an issue with one of our cabin doors, but the aircraft was safe. Also informed the passengers that we are not able to continue to ZZZ3 with the condition of the cabin door and we would be headed to ZZZ2 and that I would keep them informed along the way. We climbed to 6000 feet MSL enroute to ZZZ2. We held for an additional 20-25 minutes to burn fuel in order to land below max landing weight and decided to descend to 4000 feet MSL to burn more fuel as we were holding outside of ZZZ2. The FO continued flying and executed the ILS YY at ZZZ2. Upon landing. I taxied to the gate and shutdown with the safety vehicles standing by.Cause: I will not takeoff with any exit or cabin lights that illuminate. It could be associated with an electrical or pressurization issue. And depart the runway and make the decision on the taxiway to allow more time for decision making		Air carrier flight crew flying A320 aircraft reported cabin door malfunction inflight. Diverted and landed uneventfully.

We were given instructions to descend and maintain 3,000 until established and clear for ILS XX approach.  We were on a vector to intercept the localizer outside of the IF prior to the FAF.  FO suggested dialing in the next altitude for the FAF which was 1,600.  I approved, confusing VNAV procedures with the level change mode we were in.  Instead of leveling at 3,000 until crossing the IF, the jet dutifully continued descending toward 1,600 before we were established on the localizer.  ATC called us out and we leveled and began to climb at 2,100.  We were told to maintain 2,200 and intercept the glideslope from there.  The remainder of the approach and landing went without incident.Lost track of level of automation and failed to prevent an altitude deviation.As pilot monitoring, I need to be on guard and ready for the pilot flying to make mistakes. His suggestion sounded perfectly reasonable, and if we were in VNAV, it would have been. Given the current level of automation we were in, it was the exact wrong thing to do. Slowing down and thinking through what he was asking rather than automatically approving this suggestion would probably have prevented this infraction.

It lasted for no more than one second, but was on the heavy side of moderate turbulence.  I immediately put the seat belt sign on and made a PA.  I then immediately called to our flight attendants and spoke with the purser to assess the condition of the cabin.  She said 'everybody was fine, but there were drinks that had spilled all over the cabin'.  We reported it to ATC then found out that a Boeing 747 had passed overhead by 1,000 feet, which we were not advised of.  We only found out what type of aircraft when I called them back 2 minutes later to ask what had passed.The event happened roughly 52 minutes into the flight, so the FA's were in the aisle with the galley carts.30 minutes later during lav breaks the purser advised us that the two FA's in back HAD got injured (they didn't think so right away). FA A and B complained of back pain/soreness. FA C and D complained of shoulder soreness.  They both had fallen and struck things with their bodies apparently.  I asked if they needed medical support or paramedics to meet the aircraft and they said they did not.  I immediately informed Dispatch via ACARS of the event and told him that they could continue their duties.We landed without incident, following any and all turbulence mitigation measures as we always had during this flight.  I called to speak to our Dispatcher and he was not available so another dispatcher and he said he would relay for us.  I then called the Chief Pilot and debriefed them.FA Supervisors were at the gate and debriefed with our Flight Attendants.

We both agreed and executed it but then I saw the speed bug jump, it went into the over speed barber pole which was stuck at 270 kts on both sides so I kept 250 kts. We decided to keep 250 kts as well climbed and troubleshoot the problem. All our airspeed indications were working fine and the gear and flaps were up and we decided to stop our climb at FL230. We ran the unreliable airspeed non normal and couldn't really fine what matched our scenario other than erroneous maximum speed bars. After completing the non normal it did not fix our issue and the Captain called maintenance control to see if they could help but they had nothing new to add to what we could do. The Captain and I decided since we could not climb any higher or fly faster to get around weather out west we were going to divert to ZZZ1 which was along the way. We also had to do an overweight landing because of all the fuel we had on board and tried our best to burn it off by descending, using speed brakes, and configuring early. Everyone was informed of our situation we [requested priority handling] and we made an uneventful landing into ZZZ1.

The maximum bank angle was about 7-10 degrees left and right with significant yaw motions noticed opposite to the roll. Also present was light-moderate-severe turbulence during the entire event. We experienced (1.7G-0.7G). No high/low speed limitations or excursions were felt or noticed. The engines performed flawlessly. We kept them out of idle, per the Captain's orders to prevent them from flaming out or compressor stalling.  I was the flying pilot who noticed the wheel deflection first. I immediately brought this to the attention of the Captain. I then grabbed the control wheel and disengaged the autopilot. I was surprised how much deflection, and force it took to overcome the roll in an attempt to stay level. The Captain then joined me on the controls. After the first 2 rolling moments, it seemed to be dissipating, so I reengaged the autopilot only to have the event continue for 6 more cycles, but to a lesser degree. We both helped the autopilot stay engaged by adding input in the proper direction to keep the wings as level as possible. The speed was stable at approximately 286 knots during the entire event. After the event we slowed the aircraft to 250 knots and maintained that all the way to the airport in case we were having a flight control malfunction or some other airframe damage. We checked the positions several times on the MFD during the descent to verify flight control positions, all were showing normal and symmetrical. I disengaged the autopilot on downwind at 250 knots to verify the aircraft flight controls were functioning properly and that the aircraft flew normally. Everything seemed totally normal. I made a faster than normal approach to 25L, at the recommendation of the Captain. We asked for and received landing clearance to land on 25C. The landing was normal and we wrote up the event in the log book as having experienced a severe turbulence event. I now believe it was a severe wake turbulence event from an A380 or B747 which must have traveled through the SPI area minutes before we got there.           Cause: There must have flown through the wake of either a SUPER A380 or B747 that passed through the SPI area either climbing out of FRA, or MUC or one passing by opposite direction. We were not following anyone into FRA. The Controllers never said anything and we never asked if there was anyone there before us with a super callsign since the language is always problematic. We hope to never experience the wake of a larger, heavier aircraft again as we felt barely able to keep our B777 from becoming uncontrollable.

The ZZZ area had clear skies and it was a good morning to go flying. It was my leg and the takeoff run was uneventful. After rotation I called for "gear up" and the captain reached down to retract the gear. At that moment we saw the gear would NOT retract. We had three green and three red indicators. Once we got leveled off the Captain and I swapped controls and I became pilot monitoring. I ran the QRH and we were able to get the three green, down and locked, indications only (no red). We decided to take delay vectors to burn fuel and get below our max landing weight and coordinated with ATC, dispatch and CFR. We came back around and landed one runway XX in ZZZ with a descent rate of <200 feet per min and let the aircraft roll to the end of the runway to avoid potential stress to the gear. Captain and I thought the best idea would to get towed off the runway after the ramp chief installed the gear pins.		Day one, leg one ZZZ to ZZZZ.  VFR conditions with isolated storms in area. FO was flying takeoff, shortly after takeoff he asked for gear up, I moved the gear handle up and the gear did not retract. Three green and three red indicators and lots of noise because gear had not retracted.  I took over flying/radio duties and asked FO to run the QRH. He ran QRH and we were able to get three green (down and locked) indcations, no red. We took delay vectors  to burn down fuel and coordinate with ATC, Dispatch and CFR. Opted to return to ZZZ once below max landing weight.  Landed RW(runway) XX with 200fpm down and rolled out to end of RW. I opted to be towed off the runway after the gear pins were handed to crew chief thru cockpit window  and installed on the gear.		Air carrier flight crew reported landing gear failed to retract shortly after departure.

I continued to climb to FL360, while the captain executed the ECAM procedures. These actions were unsuccessful in resetting the ECAM messages. Upon completing the ECAM procedures, the captain continued with the associated NON-NORMAL procedures in the purser. Running this NON-NORMAL checklist, it became clear and it was confirmed that the number 1 engine was not being monitored by the FADEC anymore. The big threat was  making sure we kept the engine within its normal parameters. The checklist guided us to the appropriate max manual N1 settings for the different phases of the flight. We discussed briefly to turn around, but the captain first would contact the company and coordinate the possible return to gate. As the airplane leveled off at FL 360, I made sure the airspeed stabilized well below the "red line" (max speed) and well above the "red line" (min speed) and verified  the N1 settings with the tables in the purser. Once the return to ZZZ decision was made, the captain informed ATC we were to return to ZZZ with "engine indication problems" and did not declare an emergency. Initially we were given headings followed by direct ZZZZZ for the ZZZZZ1 arrival. The captain reprogrammed "the box" with ZZZ as the destination and loaded the arrival. The captain returned to completing the Diversion Guide and made sure we were not overweight for landing, etc. We were given a descent. The aircraft had lost the Auto Thrust capability, but the Auto Pilot was still engaged, so I adjusted the thrust manually for a reasonable descend rate. As the aircraft was under positive control and it was responding as expected, I loaded the expected runway and approach procedures, verified the altitudes, and prepared for the arrival and approach phases of the flight, while the captain now informed the flight attendants and the passengers of the newly developed scenario. Once the captain felt that all parties were informed of the new situation, we came "together again as a crew" on the flight deck . This is where he informed me of all he had done and I brought him up to speed of my status and the status of the aircraft, altitude and direct to fix, the "box having been loaded and verified by me for the arrival and approach into ZZZ. Once caught up, he resumed the PF duties and I became the PM. We ran the arrival briefing and descent checklist. We discussed the big threat in case of a "Go-Around", and other potential threats. An uneventful approach and landing followed. Once on the ground, we received a gate and the good news that another aircraft was already assigned  to  take the passengers to ZZZZ after all. The passengers were informed of the new gate and plane to make sure their expectations were met and would still make it to ZZZZ.After all checklists were completed and the passengers were deplaned, the CA called the chief pilot and discussed the stressful situation we had been in. It was decided, after answering and completing questions that the CA would not continue to ZZZZ, but I would.

Out of normal SOP and training when the MC illuminated, I called out 'My Aircraft' focusing solely on the control of the aircraft as I was the PF. This happens frequently when flying with center tank fuel. The MC will flicker as its approaching empty center fuel tanks triggering the PM to switch the center fuel tank pumps to 'off.' This time however, we still had plenty of fuel in the center tanks making us question why the MC just flickered. My Captain stated to me that there is center fuel and that no abnormal lights are illuminated anywhere in the flight deck on the lower or overhead panels. After paying attention to and determining the flight path of the aircraft was in a desired state/mode under control of the A/P and that the airspeed was exactly on the speed I had programmed for cruise in the VNAV cruise page under control of the A/T, I also began to also investigate what caused the MC to flicker while still giving plenty of attention to the flight path and airspeed of the aircraft. I thought I may have seen something rapidly illuminate and extinguish at the same time the MC did on my recall panel. I pressed on my recall and realized that I believed it was the 'HYD' that quickly flashed in the middle on the left side of my recall panel. After letting go, all recall items and both MC extinguished. This thought of maybe seeing the HYD light flash instigated me to open the 'SYS' page on the lower DU of the MFD where hydraulics information is shown. We both noticed how low the System A quantity was as it was showing 40 and dropping rapidly. We checked and all engine and electric pumps and they were all in the 'ON' position. Knowing the quantity was going to be at 0 within the next minute, I called for the 'Loss of System A QRH checklist.' The Captain began reading out loud the Loss of System A QRH checklist. The quantity was at 0 on System A when beginning the QRH. After step X and placing the A HYD PUMP switches both to 'OFF,' we noted that the quantity then rose to 13. The Captain continued the QRH procedure up until the 'deferred items' which we reviewed to understand what systems are INOP, noted that we have to stop straight ahead on the runway and have gear pins installed and then saved for later when ready to lower the landing gear. While flying the aircraft and managing the flight path and speed, I send a quick and simple message the dispatch, through ACARS, saying what QRH procedure we were working through. By the time we completed the QRH to the deferred items, dispatch was aware and had maintenance ready for the Captain to talk to. I made mention that we have ZZZ and ZZZ1 directly at our 12 o'clock. the Captain and I agreed that we will [request priority handling] but to hold off for just a moment while he called dispatch. I took control of radios while continuing to control the aircraft and the Captain called Dispatch on VHF 2 through AIRINC where he spoke with dispatch and maintenance discussing the situation and discussing a diversion. I did remind the Captain during this the ZZZ2 tower would be closed by the time we would get there making it a non suitable destination to continue to with a [priority handling] aircraft when we have ZZZ1 close by. While the Captain was on VFH 2, I made the required report to ATC and reported that we lost our System A hydraulics, we are not [requesting priority handling] just yet, they can plan on us diverting to ZZZ1, but that I would like to remain at our current altitude and route to ZZZ2 (ATC cleared up direct to ZZZ2 airport awhile back) for the time being but would like to slow to M0.73 to start buying us some time for planning. ATC kindly noted everything and approved for us to slow down. Captain came back on radio and intercom with me and we agreed that ZZZ1 is the most suitable diversion airport since they have ATC, [priority handling] equipment, the weather was good and VFR in ZZZ1, maintenance base for Company X, managers and supervisors to help get our PAX re booked, as well as a 737 base for Company X and could potentially get another plane and pilots to get our PAX continuing into ZZZ2 relatively quickly. We also agreed we will [request priority handling] since we could be spraying hydraulic fluid all over the gear bay and that we will have to stop on the runway after landing and shut engines down since we need maintenance to install gear pins before we move again. I continued to control the aircraft and radios while the Captain began to brief the Flight Attendants and then give a PAX PA. While he was completed these duties, I officially [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center and informed them that we would like to divert to ZZZ1. I was given direct to ZZZ1 airport and to report souls & FOB. I then requested that ZZZ Center reach out to ZZZ1 App and Tower to see what runway we could expect. I explained that XXC was the only runway showing open in the D-ATIS and NOTAMS and would be shown as closed as well if we landed on that runway since we will be stopping and shutting engines down on the runway. I advised that if ZZZ1 is able to open any other runways for us, we would be happy to accept Runway YYC, YYR, XXL, or XXC. We began a descent and we alerted by the MC and recall panel 'HYD' again. This time looking to the overhead panel, Low Pressure was illuminated on the engine pump for #2. We the completed the QRH for hydraulic pump low pressure which calls for that pump to be placed off. The quantity was rising and stopped at 106. Soon after, it settled at about 94. At this point, the only pump we have 'ON' is the #2 electric pump. While on our descent into ZZZ1, we received a hand off to ZZZ1 App where they informed us that they are opening Runway YYR for us and that we can expect the ILS YYR ZZZ1. I still had us slowed back in speed buying us plenty of time as well as buying our ground ops and maintenance plenty of time so they could have tow equipment ready for us. The captain completed his duties and briefs and took control of the radios again while I continued to be PF. I set up for an briefed the ILS YYR at ZZZ1. We briefed that we would bring the aircraft to a full stop on the runway, stow the boards and set the flaps to 40, set brakes, switch electrics to the APU and shut down both engines, and that we would just let the tow team tow us to the gate from there instead of starting engines again and taxiing to mitigate any further threats. We agreed on a plan to ask Approach control for direct to ZZZZZ and down to 4,000 ft so that we could get to 4,000 ft and get fully configured with the manual gear extension and QRH checklist complete and well as the before landing checklist completed before crossing ZZZZZ inbound. ATC cleared us to 4,000 ft and cleared up direct ZZZZZ. We executed exactly how we planned and had the QRH and Before Landing Checklist complete before ZZZZZ. Upon bring the aircraft to a stop, we did exactly what we briefed and I took control of the radios to talk to ARFF while the Captain made a PA to the cabin. ARFF completed a 360 degree sweep of the aircraft not seeing anything out of the usual and stated that they would hang out there with us while maintenance and tow team completed their duties and that they would then follow us all the way to the gate. Maintenance notified us that there was fluid spraying from the bottom of the #1 engine but that it would be okay to tow to the gate. We were towed to the gate where we were met with supervisors, managers, and maintenance to help with pax deplaning and for reports, AML entries.Cause: There were storms that passed through ZZZ3 before our departure which had us about an hour into the DOT delay clock after pushing back to when we were cleared for takeoff. All fluid levels were normal during the preflight inspections and before start checklist. The new procedure in the FO'sAfter Start Flow is to 'Clear Secondary Engine Indications' in order for them to auto display when a secondary engine parameter exceeds normal operating range. Since this was completed in the after start and we didn't take off for at least another hour, I wonder if it would help to put this step in the 'Below The Line' section of the Before Takeoff Checklist. If there had been a leak on the ground while sitting on the taxiway for an hour with the engines running, there is a possibility we would have noticed this before taking off. When the Captain calls 'Below The Line' on the Before Takeoff Checklist, we could possibly mitigate this by checking the SYS page, checking the ENG page and then selecting the ENG page one more time to blank out the secondaries for takeoff as a flow. This is just a thought I have had since this incident.		While in cruise en route from ZZZ3 to ZZZ2 we noticed the master caution light flickering briefly. The FO guessed that it was related to the hydraulic system and checked the hydraulic quantity as a precaution. We discovered system A quantity was low and dropping rapidly.  We were unsure what checklist to run at first but as we discussed it the quantity continued to drop and as it approached 0 we decided that the Loss of System A checklist was appropriate. We accomplished the checklist except for deferred items and I then called dispatch via AIRINC to discuss the possibility of a diversion. After briefly considering continuing to ZZZ2 we decided diverting to ZZZ1 would be the best course of action as the checklist required maintenance to meet the plane on the runway to install gear pins and the tower at ZZZ2 was due to be closed by the time we arrived. During the call Maintenance Control was patched in as well. We also [requested priority handling] with ATC. About 10 minutes after running the checklist, after signing off with dispatch and Maintenance Control and shortly after starting our descent to ZZZ1, the low pressure light for Engine Driven Pump 2 (for hydraulic system B) came on. We found the quantity for system B high and rising, the quantity indication peaking at 106%. We ran the Hydraulic Pump Low Pressure check list which called for shutting off EDP 2. After running the checklist the quantity indication for system B soon settled at 94% and stabilized. The electric pump for system B functioned normally throughout the flight. Also worth noting is that while system A quantity dropped to 0 at one point we found it at 13% shortly after running the Loss of System A checklist and it eventually came up to 20% after landing.  As we approached ZZZ1 only runway XXL was open but we were soon informed that Runway YYR would be opened for us and that after landing we could remain on the runway as long as necessary. On approach we lowered the landing gear via the manual gear extension handles as called for by the Loss of System A check list but otherwise the approach and landing were normal. After landing we discussed what needed to be done with ARFF, maintenance, and station personnel who came to meet the aircraft on the runway. I also briefed the passengers and flight attendants about the situation. We started the APU and shut down both engines so maintenance could safely install gear pins. Although it would have been possible to restart the engines and taxi to the gate, operations met the aircraft with a tug so we left the engines off and we were towed to gate X without incident where we deplaned and I wrote up the malfunctions in the AML. At the gate a mechanic mentioned that a substantial amount of hydraulic fluid was leaking from the drain mast on Engine 1.Cause: It was unclear and remains somewhat unclear if running the Loss of System A checklist when we did was the appropriate course of action. We didn't get the indications on the overhead panel consistent with what the checklist shows as an indication of Loss of System A (Low pressure on EDP 1, EMDP2, and Flight control A) but there is no checklist for low hydraulic system quantity or a known hydraulic system leak. This led to some confusion as to what checklist to run but as the hydraulic quantity was rapidly approaching 0 we considered system A to be lost and decided that was the appropriate checklist. I'm still unsure if this was the best course of action as the manual does mention the system A quantity shouldn't drop below 20% due to a leak in EDP 1 or its associated lines because of a standpipe in the System A reservoir. The manual also mentions that fluctuations in the hydraulic quantity indications in flight are normal due to a variety of reasons. While the quantity indication for system A did drop to 0 it rose again after running the Loss of System A checklist and eventually stabilized at 20% after landing. I'm still unsure if system A was truly 'lost' and if that checklist was appropriate. Some clarification on how to handle an obvious hydraulic leak, either via QRC changes or training would be helpful.		B-737 First Officer reported a hydraulic leak in one hydraulic system during cruise. The flight diverted to an alternate airport, landed, and received a tow from the runway to the gate.

Maintenance said brake fan working, temp is under the 300 limit and signed off as Ops Check OK.  After take off received auto brake ECAM which instructs crew to calculate landing distance and use manual baking. No big deal. The FO made a stabilized approach and normal landing on XXL. Around 90kts he applied braking as to make the last high speed turn off.

I leveled the airplane momentarily and must have then selected FLC after leaving the wake event, I don't actually remember doing so, but it is most likely when I did it.

At approximately 1500 feet the Captain noted to the crew, potentially conflicting aircraft traffic at approximately the 2 o'clock position. At about the same time, one of the Relief Pilots called out an overtemperature exceedance on the right engine. The Relief Pilot also noted that the right engine EPR had initially started to drop. The Captain then turned the autopilot on and slowly retarded the right engine throttle attempting to get the right engine EGT back below the temperature exceedance. At approximately the idle position the temperature remained below the temperature exceedance and back into the normal temperature operating range but at what appeared to be an elevated temperature for the idle position. At this point, the Captain elected to intercept the ZZZ XXX radial outbound per the engine failure procedure for Runway XXL even though the aircraft was at 1500 feet since the aircraft was climbing out very slowly and the Captain wanted to ensure terrain clearance while continuing to climb to 3000 and run checklists. The First Officer [requested priority handling] for the flight and told ATC the flight would be initially intercepting and proceeding outbound the ZZZ XXX radial while working the [situation].There were no EICAS messages or automatic Non-Normal Checklists displayed on the EICAS so the crew elected to perform the Engine Lim/Surge/Stall checklist on the right engine. As the First Officer performed the checklist, it was noted that the right engine temperature would increase abnormally higher as the right engine throttle was increased out of idle. As a result of the checklist, the crew decided to bring the throttle back to idle. The crew discussed the options for the right engine and decided to keep the right engine running in idle for the remainder of the flight unless absolutely needed. The crew reasoned this to be the most prudent action since the engine was still producing thrust, was at a stable but elevated temperature at idle (than normally expected) but still in the normal temperature operating range, was not operating erratically and did not appear to be damaged. Once the aircraft was stable and the Non-Normal Checklist was complete, the Captain directed the First Officer to request vectors from ATC to an area near the ZZZ airport that we could safely jettison fuel. While getting these vectors the Captain gave control of the aircraft to the First Officer so that the Captain could coordinate with dispatch, Maintenance Control and the flight attendant. The Captain asked the Relief Pilot to call the flight attendant and inform them of the current aircraft situation and that we would most likely be returning to ZZZ. Also, the Relief Pilot was instructed to make a PA announcement updating the passengers. In the meantime, the Captain was able to coordinate a discussion with dispatch and maintenance control. Maintenance Control noted that from his equipment sensors and readings of our aircraft that the exceedance was real and not a spurious indication. The crew discussed and was in agreement that the flight should return to ZZZ after jettisoning fuel. The Captain informed dispatch and Maintenance Control of the crew's decision to return to ZZZ and asked for any other recommendations for the engine issue, jettisoning fuel and coordination for the return to ZZZ. Maintenance Control gave no further guidance and noted the crew's intention to return to ZZZ and stated he would coordinate with Maintenance. Dispatch reminded the crew to annotate the time, location and fuel amount at the beginning and end of the fuel jettison process. Dispatch also indicated that he would calculate landing data for the return to ZZZ. Once the crew arrived at the ATC coordinated fuel jettison area the Captain initiated the Fuel Jettison checklist. The crew decided to jettison fuel down to the max landing weight so that the overweight checklist would not have to be run and a maintenance overweight inspection would not be required. The fuel jettison procedures for the amount of fuel onboard took approximately 30 minutes. During this time period the crew monitored the right engine for any changes and discussed and prepared the flightdeck for the descent, approach, landing, Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) coordination and return to the Gate. The crew anticipated a normal landing and decided that if there were no issue upon landing that they would coordinate to clear the runway and have ARFF inspect the right engine on the Taxiway for any issues prior to taxiing to the gate. Upon completion of the Fuel jettison checklist, the Captain briefed the crew for a single engine flaps 20 ILS approach to Runway XXR. Dispatch was having difficulties with the landing data so the Relief Pilot ran the landing data numbers for a single engine landing. The checklists were completed for descent/landing and the Captain flew the single engine approach to Runway XXR for an uneventful landing. Upon landing the Captain cleared the Runway and ARFF inspected the right engine, found no issues, so the flight continued to Gate. The passengers were then deboarded to the gate area and turned over to the gate agents. At the gate the crew debriefed maintenance concerning the right engine temperature exceedance. The crew noted to maintenance that the exceedance temperature was approximately 666 degrees celsius. Also, from the point the crew noticed the exceedance to the point the Captain promptly retarded the throttle to idle, the time duration was approximately one minute. The Captain then debriefed with the flight attendants and with the gate agents. The Captain and the flight crew then debriefed with Dispatch and the Chief Pilot through a telephone conference call. Finally, the flight crew debriefed their own performance.				Captain flying 777 aircraft reported EGT exceedance during takeoff climb. Flight crew returned and landed uneventfully.

After ECAM actions were completed the CA directed the FO to fly the aircraft and he created a phone patch with Dispatch and [maintenance] via comms. [Maintenance] verified the G sys was lost but offered no other input or suggestions. Our reception with dispatch was poor and spotty. It was hard to make out much if anything. We knew we were most likely going to divert. CA led an open discussion on options with FO in put. He consulted with dispatch via ACARS. Our closest preferred diversion airport with a longer runway was ZZZ and they were between CAT 1 and CAT 2 minimums.We were halfway to our destination ZZZZ however, the terrain, possible wet runway/decreased braking action and elevation made it a less than preferred choice. CA and FO opted to return to ZZZ1 since we had the gas, the weather was VFR and they had two 11,000 ft runways. Under CA direction, the FO [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and received direct to ZZZ1. Our dispatcher working through ACARS attempted to modified the release with new landing data which caused the aircraft to have an init disagree that made our ACARS intermittent. We were able to receive a message with landing length of 4600ft. After briefing the FAs, the CA resumed PF duties. Both CA and FO reviewed the manual gear extension and tow in procedures. Coordinated tow in with company via center. The CA briefed the approach and supplementary procedures. We landed safely and were towed in. During tow in, CA coordinated with ops regarding procedures for two deportees bound for ZZZ3 onboard. With procedures in position we were given approval to open door and deplane. We debriefed in the flight deck and CA debriefed FAs after flight.				A320 First Officer reported Hydraulic Failure and return to departure airport.

It sounded as though it was on the First Officers side. I would compare it to someone holding down an air horn, like you'd find at a sports event. We both agreed immediately there must be some kind of air leak or faulty seal. We immediately requested a descent to 10,000. I told the First Officer his aircraft, his radios, tell them we want to return to ZZZ. I called the cabin who said they heard it as well, they thought it was an alarm going off, and was loud enough it could be heard significantly far back in the cabin. I explained though loud and unsettling, it was minor, we already where reaching an altitude where pressurization was no longer needed and due to the issue we would return to ZZZ for a precautionary landing, I'd call them back once we caught up. I made a calm similar pa to the passengers. I heard the First Officer at this time change frequency and the Controller asked if we were [requesting priority handling], I told the First Officer that sounds good. I considered how it was difficult to communicate, and that we would be over weight when landing and could not logically think of any reason not to. I then called ZZZ ops and Maintenance and spoke to Maintenance, they asked if we could go to ZZZ2, i said no, it wasn't suitable, and said I was ok with ZZZ3 or ZZZ. The noise made communication difficult, thus I elected calling on the radio vs crew phone. I also sent an ACARS message and ACARS diversion report. The First Officer got us on a delay vector and down to 7000. ZZZ Maintenance called Maintenance Control and Operations Control I believe and told us ZZZ was ok but if I do get time call Operations Control to verify the best airport operationally. At this time we leveled at 7000 and the noise finally stopped. I told ZZZ that id call Operations Control. I called dispatch on the crew phone, they also requested ZZZ2, i told them unable, in which the dispatcher asked if I would go to ZZZ3. I said ZZZ3 was good, it has a longer runway than ZZZ anyway, and confirmed the company would prefer I go to ZZZ3 vs ZZZ, he confirmed and acar us the new information. We informed atc, we requested the longest suitable runway, which was XXL and was in use. We requested to have fire rescue meet us upon landing. We continued the delay vectors a few more times as we ran the non routine landing check list, and overweight landing check list. Followed by setting up and briefing the approach. We then ran the descent and before landing check list. During this I briefed the flight attendants again about the precautionary landing and made a calm reassuring brief pa to the passengers. I then took back the aircraft from the First Officer. We did the rnav XXL and we landed uneventfully on XXL, exited, followed the correct flow, passengers, inspection, and proceeded uneventfully to the Gate, in which maintenance met the aircraft.I believe our training worked very well and it felt like a good sim session. We communicated well in the flight deck, even with the barriers of a very loud noise. First Officer was very quick to identify we should descend right away to 10,000. We ran the Threat and Error Management model and both briefed each other well and checked in that we were performing normally. First Officer was an absolute asset and monumental in a safe, calm, correct outcome.				B737 Captain reported the flight and cabin crews heard a loud sound during departure climb which they determined to likely be an air leak. Flight crew diverted and completed a safe overweight landing.

Departed ZZZZ heading to ZZZ1 ended up diverting to ZZZ. We were just about to ZZZZZ. And the left engine drive light came on with the master caution electric, Check Pilot completed the drive light QRH procedure. The left generator was now disconnected, and I was able to start the APU as they were running the checklist as I knew what was coming, I just did this in the SIM Before starting IOE. Just when we thought we had the situation under control the APU auto shut down and we got the low oil pressure light illuminated the Autopilot disconnected again and I was still flying so I got the aircraft under control engaged command B Autopilot and gave the aircraft to Check Pilot to run the source off light checklist. At this point, Check Pilot [requested priority handling] as I was in the QRH. Check Pilot decided they were going to try and restart the APU using Captain's authority so that we weren't single generator. We were successful in getting the APU back up, but didn't know if we can trust the APU. At this point, we both started talking about if the Autopilot were to fell again we would divert to ZZZ2, ZZZ3, or ZZZ4. Depending on what was the closest at that point in time. I was completing the non-routine, landing checklist in the QRH and talking to the flight attendants and the passengers and coordinating with Dispatch who did a PHENOMENAL JOB. We [rejected the priority handling] and joined the arrival into ZZZ on the descent. I asked Check Pilot to check if we were going to be overweight and they did and figured out we were gonna be 300 to 700 pounds overweight. So I decided to configure early and add dragged by getting the gear down to try to burn some of that weight. We landed in ZZZ uneventful and if I might add, I rolled it on. Parked at gate [XX] no issues.Cause: this new Company APP is AWEFUL you can't hide the pages at the bottom of the app hides all kinds of stuff trying to tilt the iPad to try and see the text in an emergency is really stupid.		It was night time and we were flying ZZZZ to ZZZ1. I was in the right seat (pilot monitoring (PM) and pilot in command (PIC)) conducting Captain OE. At FL370 in near ZZZZZ, we got a master caution and L engine drive light. I completed the DRIVE LIGHT QRH procedure. The L generator was now disconnected and the APU was running and powering AC TRANSFER bus 1. We had 2 sources of power and elected to continue to ZZZ1. I said, "let's make a plan in case the APU craps out." Master Caution, APU lights. The APU had auto shutdown and the low oil pressure light illuminated. The OE Captain gave me the aircraft and completed the SOURCE OFF checklist. I [requested priority handling] and stated we were diverting to ZZZ. The OE Captain notified dispatch via ACARS. ZZZ2 was the closest airport and we were discussing going there because it was nearest suitable. During that discussion, I attempted to restart on the APU and it was successful. We were now back to 2 sources of electrical power. I [rejected priority handling] and we opted to continue to ZZZ. At this point neither of us were certain the APU was going to continue to run. ZZZ was as also the best choice for the passengers and operation. We agreed that if the APU again shutdown we could amend our divert into ZZZ2, ZZZ3, or ZZZ4, depending on what was closest. We added those airports to FD PRO alternates. The OE Captain completed the non routine landing considerations checklist. Dispatch confirmed we were headed to ZZZ. We told Dispatch that we [rejected priority handling] because we had 2 sources of electrical power. At some point in the descent, I had a little spare time and decided to check with the FAs because I was busy while the OE Captain was making PAs, etc. They said that they made another PA because the pax were not clear on why we were headed to ZZZ (the PA had come through at a very low volume, not unusual in the 737). The FAs did not want to disturb us because we were running checklists, etc. The OE Captain made another PA with the handset this time.Approaching ZZZ we realized that we would be around 700 lbs over max landing weight and that we would need to [request priority handling] for that. I did a landing assessment. Right around that time Dispatch asked if we would be over max landing weight. The OE Captain added drag to burn off some fuel. We decided to get the airplane on the ground instead of holding to burn off fuel. We requested priority handling and the OE Captain landed uneventfully. We ended up landing 400 lbs above max landing weight. I debriefed the flight attendants (FAs) that if a PA is unreadable, call us. Communication on every front important. If we are busy, I would just tell you, I'll call you back. I will add that to my FA brief.Cause: I initially had issues locating the QRH in Company APP because of the new update. I always keep it in favorites at the top of the list. As I sit here I have tried to reorganize my favorites and the QRH will not stay at the top of the list. I have created a section called 'Emergency'. If I have a suggestion, it would be a "pro tip" publication to make an 'Emergency' section.		B-737 air carrier pilot reported a generator drive malfunction during cruise on a training flight. The crew diverted to an alternate airport and landed safely.

Phone patch with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and told it was ok per the book if no other indications. While coordinating with Dispatch, EICAS Elec Gen Drive R message came up, ran checklist and disconnected the generator. Made decision to divert to ZZZZ. Coordinated with ZZZ radio for ZZZZ. Given right hand turn direct ZZZZ maintain FL310. Eventually given routing and FL300 from ZZZZ. Monitored right engine conditions enroute to ZZZZ. Oil quantity had dropped to 2 prior to divert and eventually settled at 1, oil pressure was between 67-61, oil temp 78-80, vibration .4. Right engine indications remained the same through descent and landing. Uneventful arrival and landing on Runway XXL at ZZZZ and taxi to gate XX.		During cruise, while approaching ZZZZZ1, right engine indicated low engine oil quantity with a decreasing trend. Oil temperature remained nominal with a slight decreasing pressure trend. Conferred with Dispatch and Maintenance Control with entire flight crew present. Consensual agreement was reached to divert to ZZZZ. Received initial ATC clearance to proceed to ZZZZ. During initial execution of divert to ZZZZ, right engine indicated ELEC ENG DRIVE R, EICAS message. Executed procedures per Electronic Checklist (ECL) and Flight Manual (FM). Contingency plans were discussed with entire flight crew regarding possible engine failure due to oil quantity. Normal two engine approach and landing was made at ZZZZ. Upon completion of post flight, terminating procedures, discussions were held with station maintenance personnel. Right engine required servicing of engine oil with 16qts. There were no obvious, visible signs of major engine oil leak. The question of how to account for the lost engine oil remains unanswered with myself.		B777 flight crew reported low engine oil quantity in right engine and a generator fault during cruise. Flight crew diverted to suitable airport and landed safely.

I was in the right seat as pilot monitoring (PM). We requested a climb via CPDLC and were instructed to climb to FL400. Not long after the engines spooled up for climb power there was an abrupt banging sound followed by moderate to severe vibrations in the aircraft and a loud sound of engine malfunctions filling the cockpit. A message popped up on the EICAS and as we were starting to read the message and analyze I first smelled and then saw smoke entering the cockpit. The Captain and I donned the O2 mask and attempted to establish comms amidst the loud noise and smoke all while the aircraft was in a climb. The Captain controlled the aircraft manually at first and then reengaged the Autopilot. The first EICAS message was for ELEC GEN DRIVE L. The relief pilots were getting out of the bunk around this time as the loud noise and vibrations had woken them; they had to move through significant smoke to get to their seats and don oxygen. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center and began a left turn toward ZZZ which was around 200 NM away. When running the Electronic Checklist (ECL) for ELEC GEN DRIVE L, pressing the DRIVE DISC switch had no apparent effect and the APU was MEL'd so we couldn't start it. The next EICAS to populate was ENG OIL PRESS L. I ran this checklist which directed a shutdown of the L engine, upon which the vibrations and sounds decreased but did not go away completely. Our main concern at this point was severe engine damage and potential separation. The smoke was no longer building but there was still an odor of smoke, communications amongst a four person crew and ATC and Dispatch was a challenge on oxygen masks. In the meantime we initiated a single engine driftdown to FL316 in coordination with ZZZ Center, and the relief pilot initiated a SAT phone call with Dispatch for their recommendations. We gathered weather and NOTAMS for ZZZ and ZZZ1 from Center as well as another company aircraft who helped relay information. The weather and NOTAMS in ZZZ supported the RNAV (GPS) approach to Runway XX, the ILS GS was notam'ed out of service. Based on the information received from all these sources and considering that we still had smoke/fumes in the cockpit, an engine shut down, and no APU, we decided as a crew to divert to ZZZ and advised Center of our intentions. We continued our descent and received the FUEL IMBALANCE EICAS message and I ran the corresponding checklist. The relief pilot ran performance for a 20 flap landing from the QRH as directed by the checklist. We completed all normal checklists and built a holding pattern at the IAF for the RNAV Runway XX to complete our descent. We planned, briefed, and flew a single engine 20 flap approach to Runway XX and stopped straight ahead on the runway. We were in communication with crash fire and rescue who came out onto the runway to inspect the L engine and then they marshaled us with a follow me truck off the runway to a parking location. We cancelled IFR with Center and thanked them for their assistance. We became aware during the taxi that we would need a ground electrical cart to hook up to the airplane to avoid the jet going dark when we shut down the R engine, because the APU was MEL'd. We waited in parking for the ground crews who had been called in off alert and were unfamiliar with the 777 to find and retrieve a ground power cart and air stairs. We verified the ground power specifications from Maintenance Control and advised the ground crews where to find the power receptacle. We cancelled the [priority handling] as this was a requirement for the ground crew to apply electrical power. After verifying the power source we shut down the R engine, disarmed doors, completed all normal post flight checklists, and began all of the coordination with ZZZ personnel for our unexpected arrival. Visual inspection of the L engine revealed significant visual damage to the fan blades and other areas, see pictures and videos taken. Eventually upon reaching billeting we were seen by medical staff as we were experiencing headaches, sore throat, stinging eyes, etc, presumably from the smoke exposure. The entire crew did an excellent job at handling a difficult situation with compounding challenges in a remote and critical part of an ocean crossing. A failure in the engine after climb power was added causing moderate to severe vibrations, damage, smoke and fumes, and engine shutdown. Fatigue was not a factor in this event but I do want to point out that company revised our departure time from XA:57 to XG:30 of causing a complete flip in rest requirements after it was already too late to adjust rest planning. I had also just returned from a company trip with multiple time zone swaps, poor rest opportunities, and poor rest opportunity upon returning back to base. The crew performed remarkably well considering the last minute changes to rest planning but it did add to the difficulty of a major aircraft problem. Maintenance practices on recent work done on this engine need to be investigated. The engine catastrophically failed at cruise, additionally causing smoke and fumes, leaving an extremely difficult situation for the crew to recover.		I was the relief pilot ZZZ2-ZZZZ. I was sound asleep in the crew rest area (lower bunk) when I was awoken by several loud bangs and severe vibrations, followed by the smell of smoke. The other relief pilot (who was in top bunk) and I immediately exited the crew rest area. After opening the crew rest door I saw a significant amount of smoke, almost resembling dense fog all through the cabin and up into flight deck, I could barely see into the flight deck due to the severity of the smoke/fumes. Other relief pilot and I immediately entered the flight deck and donned our O2 masks. The airplane had just leveled at FL400. ELEC GEN DRIVE L and ENG OIL PRESS L checklists were being accomplished by the First Officer (FO). Captain was hand flying and making a left turn off the airway. Southeast driftdown was initiated to FL316. We were roughly 200 miles to ZZZ, initial course was established to ZZZ. Captain was busy flying and managing, FO was busy running checklists and backing up flight path/ATC comms, I established comms on SAT phone with Dispatch for weather/notams for ZZZ/ZZZ2, spoke with ATC at times and acquired info on available ground services. I also backed up the crew on approach procedures, diversion requirements, and emergency requirements. Other relief pilot was busy with running landing performance, backing up the crew, and securing the cabin. Crew made decision to divert to ZZZ as it had adequate weather conditions. All normal checklists were completed. Fuel imbalance checklist was completed. Thorough briefings were conducted. Engine was secured, smoke slowly dissipated during the descent. We were cleared for the RNAV GPS XX approach, we did one turn in the hold at ZZZZZ and then executed a safe single engine, flaps 20 approach and landing to Runway XX. After landing, we stopped the aircraft on the runway to get a full inspection from crash/fire/rescue. All was clear, we exited the runway and taxied to park on the ramp. APU was MEL'd, so we coordinated with Maintenance Control and ground ops to get adequate and safe external power connected to the airplane. External power was connected successfully and our only remaining engine was shut down. Catastrophic Engine Failure. Left engine was replaced the previous day.Aircraft had 4 MELs and 1 CDL:APU inopHUD inopFO EFB removedNitrogen Generation DegradedI witnessed the Captain/FO struggling to communicate with their O2 masks on. It's because this aircraft was not equipped with HOT mics. Every time they wanted to speak they had to hit the transmit button for it to come over the speaker so often things had to be repeated. This is a major safety issue and made this situation significantly more challenging. All company 777's need to be immediately equipped with hot mics for safety reasons.		B777 flight crew reported shut down of one engine and divert to a non-towered airport due severe engine vibrations and smoke and fumes. Reporters stated the engine had been replaced the day before.

The Relief Pilot #2 opened the crew rest door and we saw smoke. Enough smoke that it was getting hard to see. We immediately went to the cockpit and donned oxygen mask. The crew was in the process of a drift down around FL380 and going through to checklists. XXXX was squawked and ATC was addressing with "[priority handling]". One checklist concluded with the left engine being shut down. There were comms with Dispatch and ATC. We then navigated to ZZZ1 while getting weather and running checklists. At first ZZZ1 wasn't reporting a ceiling or wind. So ZZZ2 was considered. Dispatch was asked if there were any other airports to consider. About 10 min later ATC was able to report the weather at ZZZ1, which was closer and had a longer runway. Everyone discussed and decided it was the best choice. Continued to ZZZZZ and smoke in cockpit dissipated and held for the GPS XX. Held so we could lose the remaining altitude and once we had the altitude commenced the approach. Landed, stopped on the runway and had the fire/rescue look over the damaged engine. They cleared us for taxi via a follow me. Continued to park where we had to wait for power as the APU was MEL. Cause: Unsure at this point. The left engine had been replaced recently.				B777 pilot reported smoke in the cockpit requiring oxygen masks to be donned. Flight crew performed inflight engine shutdown and diverted to suitable airport.

The FO and myself discussed the MEL, the procedures and restrictions of the MEL.  We discussed them again during the threat forward brief lead by the FO (who was PF) noting that this was not an MEL either of us have dealt with and a procedure we've never done before.  As part of the after start flow, and before takeoff flow, we noted the Pack light agreed it was associated with the pack MEL. We proceeded as normal.  After we took off and I completed my after takeoff flow, I caught that we were not pressurizing.  I began trouble shooting the air conditioning and bleed configuration.  My first thought was that I must have mis configured the AC and Bleeds as per the MEL procedure which called for a non standard bleed configuration. I reviewed the MEL procedure and confirmed it was procedurally correct.  We were continuing to climb and still not pressurizing, so we agreed to stop our climb.  We asked for and got clearance for 10,000" (I think we were assigned 16,000' and currently passing 8500').  I then went to the QRH for the Pack light seeing that it had to be a failed pack that was not allowing us to pressurize. When we leveled at 10,000' we got a momentary Cabin Altitude Warning. In hindsight we probably should've dawned oxygen masks, but we were level at 10,000', closely monitoring the cabin altitude and task saturated with the QRH. We got an immediate decent to 8000'.  The QRH procedure was unsuccessful at brining the L pack back online.  We followed the procedure to land at the nearest practical airport (back to ZZZ).  With the cabin altitude below 10,000' and no other immediate threats, I elected not to declare an emergency.  We followed the procedures for a non routine landing, ACARS messaged our divert, spoke with FAs and made a PA to the passengers.The FO made the uneventful landing back at ZZZ approximately 25 minutes into the flight.  We taxied back to the gate, deplaned the aircraft, wrote up the L Pack and proceeded to the new gate with our new aircraft.  We were able to complete the ZZZ1 turn two hours late, but otherwise uneventfully.  My original thought was that we lost the second pack inflight.  But after reexamining our steps from the beginning and a thorough review of the MEL, the L pack must have failed on the ground or maybe never was functioning.  We miss identified the pack light as being associated with the MEL and not a separate failure of the remaining pack.  We spent a lot of time discussing the MEL on preflight.  That set up an expectation bias that a light associated with the pack might be associated with the MEL.  The thought that we could have had an additional pack failure never crossed my mind.  In hindsight it would've been helpful to brief what a loss of the remaining pack would look like and the critical nature of single pack operations (should we even be taking this airplane to ZZZ1?).  Some good lessons learned.Cause: Expectation bias associated with MEL, inexperience with this type of MEL and MEL procedures.				B737-800 Captain reported aircraft wouldn't pressurize due to failure of the left pack, the right pack was already on an MEL. The flight crew ran the QRH procedure but was unsuccessful and decided to return to the airport.

The master caution alerted and after looking up I noticed the 'wing-body overheat' light illuminated.  I said 'my aircraft' and called for the wing-body overheat QRH procedure. Shortly after the light, the departure controller handed us off to center but after a short conversation with the captain, I took over the radio and communicated the captain's decision to return to ZZZ.  This malfunction had occurred the day prior on the same jet and the MX corrective action was to fix an actual problem and not just an indication. After completing the QRH procedure the light remained on and continued to remain on for at least the next ten minutes.  The captain decided to [request priority handling] and ask to be met by Crash Fire Rescue (CFR). We returned to ZZZ and was met by CFR. They scared the right side of the aircraft and found no anomalies.  We taxied to the gate and after opening the main cabin door the CFR personnel entered the cockpit and asked for the captain to sign some paperwork.  After the event and debriefing it ourselves we came to the shared conclusion that we were not fit to continue and reported fatigued. There has been a fatigue report filed by me about this event.Causal factors included: Task saturation and a high level of concern for the safety of the flight.		I started out the day with relatively good rest. I felt ready for Day 2.Aircraft X started out fairly normal except for write-up in Aircraft X's logbook about a right WING BODY OVERHEAT light that had occurred the day before.  I was concerned because the crew reported the light did not go out after running the QRH and maintenance had reported they found a loose clamp on right Air Cycle Machine (ACM) and it had been secured.  I was also curious if the crew had diverted for the issue and reviewed their flights but saw the flight had gone back and forth from ZZZ to ZZZ1.Ground ops were normal and we took off around XA:30 pm. Climbing through 11,000' we got a right WING BODY OVERHEAT.  The FO was flying and continued to fly while I got out the QRH and ran through the steps.  The jet showed the same indications as the day before- at the end of the checklist the light did not go out.  One of the frustrating things about this is that the QRH gives no further guidance.  Should we land 'As soon as possible'?  'As soon as conditions permit'?.  The lack of guidance caused a further workload because we had no official guidance to go by but our instincts/experience at this point. I would say we were relatively cool and professional during the whole event but I would characterize a bit of nervousness that we were both suppressing during the flight as we were in constant fear/uncertainty if this problem would escalate further and we would lose systems or a fire would start.  On one of my former aircraft a bleed air leak was a very serious malfunction that usually resulted in the plane catching on fire, loss of flight controls and eventual ejection from the jet.  This was a main contributor to the stress I was feeling.This all led to serious concern in the cockpit and I relayed to the FO that I was no longer comfortable taking the jet to ZZZ2 and that we would return to ZZZ3 because we had a jet that - for the second day in a row - had an unknown situation of very high heat escaping into its right wing area.  We [requested priority handling] and the FO flew jet back to ZZZ3 while I ran the necessary checklists of informing ATC/Company/Pax/FA's of our intentions and coordinating Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to be standing by for our landing.We landed uneventfully and ARFF looked us over, there was no abnormal heat indications so we had them follow us to the gate.  After we shut the engines down,  advised the passengers that they would need to deplane, ran through the shutdown checklist, did a walk-around and worked with maintenance to get the incident written up, and informed ops and dispatch of the status of the jet, I started to experience different symptoms of fatigue.   I was feeling a pit in my stomach - nauseous.  I was also feeling a little depressed - wondering if we had done the right things and irritated/frustrated that the QRH wasn't more detailed for our situation.   As I started to evaluate my Fitness for Duty to carry on with the rest of the flights of the day, I was concerned I didn't have the mental or physical capacity to go through another event like the one we just had.  That led me to believe that the stress we encountered from handling the situation itself, plus the stress of the underlying apprehension from not knowing if the malfunction would turn worse, caused me to be 'worn out' and not feeling like I wanted to fly anymore today, or better yet, should fly anymore today.  This realization of my current physiological state caused me to report 'fatigued'.1.  Perceived lack of guidance in checklist.  Add a step at end of WING BODY OVERHEAT checklist when the light does not go out to advise whether landing is recommended immediately or as soon as conditions permit.  This would alleviate stress from not knowing the severity of the malfunction and then worrying about making the correct decision of what to do next. 2.  No streamlined way to remove yourself from flying after a high-stress event like this.  Due to the stress of this situation, I did not realize what I was experiencing was fatigue.  Many phone calls to company/mentors were required to remove ourselves from flying when I no longer felt Fit for Duty.   Provide more education in the fatigue program that acute stress that occurs on flights with malfunctions such as this can cause fatigue. 3.  Not enough info in previous logbook write up for this condition.  Would have been nice to know what phase of flight they were in when it occurred, why they chose to continue to destination.  Any other items that occurred during the flight.  Increase emphasis to pilots to give a little more detail when writing up a more serious condition that would warrant more facts for perspective.		Air carrier flight crew reported a Wing Body Overheat warning and returned to departure airport.

As we crossed the hold short line, tower cleared us for take-off with RNAV to ZZZZZ. While lining up with runway center line and bringing the throttles to 40% both myself and the FO heard tower clear an aircraft to cross the runway stating traffic holds in position. We both questioned what we heard as I brought the throttles back to idle and stopped the aircraft. At this point we heard tower cross a second aircraft. FO transmitted to tower that we had a clearance for takeoff and were holding our position. Tower acknowledged and instructed us to hold position. After traffic crossed we were giving clearance for takeoff. I believe ZZZ tower simply made a mistake but this enforces the need for sterile cockpit.		Cleared to line up and wait XXR. While moving into position cleared to takeoff XXR RNAV departure. As we completed the right turn to align with the runway, started to hear tower clear aircraft to cross XXR. The CA brought the plane to a stop and I told tower we were going to hold our takeoff. Once the runway cleared we received another takeoff clearance and departed normally.ATC workload: multiple aircraft landing XYL and holding short XXR, several calls were handled by same tower controller in between clearing us for takeoff and inadvertently clearing multiple aircraft to cross.		B737-800 flight crew reported as they began to accelerate for takeoff they heard Tower clear aircraft to cross the runway ahead of them and rejected the takeoff.

I rejected the takeoff. We exited the runway, did an Rejected Takeoff (RTO) QRC followed by the ECAM procedure (negative hot brakes). The ECAM procedure had us shut down the number 2 engine which completed the ECAM. We made a log entry, notified Maintenance and ops. We returned to the gate and debriefed.

The aircraft slightly pitched up and slowed its descent to facilitate the slowdown. When it reached 250 KIAS, we were descending through approximately 11,300' MSL, two miles prior to the fix. The nose then lowered and the aircraft settled into a 1500 FPM descent with no sign of leveling at the hard-coded altitude restriction of 11,000. I intervened and leveled the airplane manually at 11,000. Then, once we had passed the fix, I re-entered NAV mode, with no further issues on the arrival.

First issue was a flight control issue we noticed during our multiple level offs during our climb up to cruise. We noted that the plane was flying with a roughly 3 degree turn of roll to the right while in level flight. We tried to rectify the issue by cycling the autopilot and hand flying but the issue remained. The CA (Captain) started a discussion with Maintenance Control and Dispatch to write up the issue. While we worked problem 1 problem 2 emerged. The number 2 brake temp sensor started to behave erratically and was giving us an intermittent hot brakes ECAM and was showing brake temps up to 900C, before the sensor displayed XX and stopped providing input. We discussed our options and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. After working on problem 2 we got another ECAM for Door R Aft EMER Exit. This ECAM has the crew monitor cabin pressure and if necessary perform an emergency descent down to 10,000 ft. After discussing this third problem with Maintenance Control and Dispatch the CA decided to change our destination to ZZZ2 in order to have MX look at the plane. I contacted ATC and notified them of our intentions to change our destination, and that we were not [requesting priority handling]. We chose a lower altitude and then had an uneventful return to ZZZ after Dispatch asked us to fly there instead of ZZZ2. We landed at ZZZ and handed the plane back off to MX.				A320 First Officer reported a flight control issue during cruise followed by two unrelated equipment issues. Flight crew returned to departure airport and aircraft was sent to maintenance.

This was caused by a IRU failure (as indicated by an IRU FAULT light and associated Cautions from systems dependent on heading and altitude from the IRU). We lost heading and attitude information on the CA (Captain)primary display and heading on the standby ADI. The CA took control of the aircraft from the minor upset and brought the aircraft back up to the cleared altitude. The aircraft descended approximately 550 ft below our cleared altitude during the event. We ran the associated QRH checklist for the IRU fault and recovered attitude and heading to the CA side using the IRS Transfer Switch. During the failure, the heading and wind information on the Nav displays appeared to be inaccurate, so we coordinated with ATC for confirmation of our heading and position relative to our flight plan course, and advised them of our equipment failure. ATC descended us below RVSM airspace and we continued to our destination. ATC advised that they did not have an indication of our altitude deviation. Over time the Nav displays and wind information eventually became reliable. We decided that it would be better that the FO land the aircraft due to the loss of flight director guidance on the CA side. The approach and landing was hand flown to ZZZ in accordance with the QRH without further incident. Cause: Equipment failure appears to be the cause. No recommendations to mitigate risk.				Air carrier flight crew reported a loss of aircraft control due to Inertial Reference System failure. The crew regained control and continued the flight.

While turning the corner from the Taxiway to the Runway, I slowly began increasing power to allow the engines to spool up. I then heard the Controller clear an aircraft to cross Runway XXR. As we turned onto the Runway, I looked down the Runway looking for any aircraft near it. I noticed a Company E175 taxiing between XXL and XXR approaching XXR. I delayed setting power for takeoff to see what the E175 was going to do. When it became clear they weren't slowing down and were probably the aircraft cleared to cross XXR, I pointed this out to my FO, reduced the power to idle and called a rejected takeoff. My FO immediately announced the reject over the radio and the Controller acknowledged. As we rolled down the Runway, I questioned the takeoff clearance with my FO. He strongly confirmed that we cleared for takeoff. While clearing the Runway, I then questioned the Controller about the takeoff clearance. He admitted that it was "his mistake". After clearing, the aircraft was stopped while I briefed the cabin crew and passengers. The FO consulted the rejected takeoff checklist and a call was made to dispatch. It was determined the flight was good to continue. The Tower gave us a phone number and asked us to call upon reaching our destination ZZZ1. We called them back and their interest seemed to be when we knew about the other aircraft and what actions we took during the event. Unknown as the mistake was admitted by the atc controller		We were cleared for take-off, Runway XXR in ZZZ. The weather was CAVOK with light winds. The Captain was the Pilot Flying, we executed a rolling take-off. When the Captain spooled up the engines to 40% N1 and we both realized that a Company E170 was crossing our Runway. I, the First Officer Pilot Monitoring, called for the abort in which the Captain aborted the take off. I reported the aborted take off to the Tower in which we were instructed to cancel the take off clearance and exit the runway. We reported the reason for the aborted take off in which ZZZ Tower mentioned it was their mistake since they cleared the E175 to cross the Runway XXR while we were cleared for take off on Runway XXR. After going through the appropriate checklists the Captain made a call to Dispatch. Since the abort was completed below 40KTS, the brakes were cool and in good condition, fuel quantity was above min fuel, and dispatch was informed we decided to continue the flight. The flight was completed with no further problems. I believe we avoided an incident or accident by relying on our training and executing effective CRM. Being aware of your surroundings and always double check clearances. ATC also makes mistakes.

During takeoff we could feel the aircraft overpressurizing more intensely than normal. We continued a normal climb up to 3000 feet and completed the after takeoff checklist. ATC gave us a climb to 16,000 and we told them we needed to stay at 3000 to work out a mechanical issue. I transferred control of the aircraft and saw the aircraft cabin rate would climb to about 4000 ft per min (the maximum it can display) and above 3.0 differential pressure until there was a loud bang or pop coming from the rear of the aircraft, to where the cabin rate would immediately reverse to 4000 fpm down until it depressurized to about 0.5-1.0 differentual pressure, to where the cycle would start all over every 3-5 seconds approximately. There is no checklist for an overpressurization fault, and we had not reached the maximum differential pressure for the overpressure relief valve, so we opened the outflow valve per the 'cabin altitude uncontrollable' portion of the unscheduled pressurization change QRH to relieve physiological pressure and prevent a possible overpressurization should the valve not open on the ground. Being at 3000 ft, we determined it was not necessary or unsafe to be unpressurized. I continued with the with the non routine landing considerations QRH and let Dispatch know we would need to return, to which they determined ZZZ would be a more suitable diversion field. Landed without event and made appropriate logbook entry.				Air carrier pilot reported a pressurization failure during initial climb and a diversion to a nearby airport.

We were in smooth air when we suddenly hit moderate turbulence from wake turbulence. It lasted only a second or two and then became smooth again. I contacted the Purser and asked if anyone was hurt. She indicated that everyone was ok. I informed ATC that we had just gotten moderate turbulence from someone's wake and they said that a 747 had just passed across our path and apologized for not issuing any traffic advisory. About a half hour later 2 of the flight attendants (FAs) said they had hurt their necks due to whiplash. I asked if they needed any medical assistance. They said they didn't feel that bad and they could continue the flight and didn't want paramedics meeting the flight.				B737 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence at FL350 from a B747 that had crossed the aircraft's path.

Runway XY was loaded into the FMCG as the departure runway by the FO. Takeoff data was sent for Runway XX and loaded into the FMGC. The oversight was not discovered during FMGC verification or the Before Takeoff Checklist and therefore went uncorrected. After an uneventful taxi to Runway XX, the aircraft was issued a takeoff clearance, departed Runway XX, and instructed to contact ZZZ departure. During this time, the flight director commanded a left turn which was followed by the pilot-flying. Referencing the SID chart for cleared procedure, it was confirmed that the correct procedure was a right turn to a heading of 210 after takeoff. Before correction could be initiated, ZZZ departure immediately announced a 'low altitude alert' and directed an 'immediate turn to a 180 heading' with further climbs and turns northbound. ATC instruction was complied with and the crew was later handed off to ZZZ center without further incident. The crew was also directed to contact ZZZ approach on a provided phone number and warned about a 'possible pilot deviation'.After reaching cruise altitude, the event was debriefed. It was at this time that the crew realized the cause for the incorrect flight director guidance was likely the improper runway loaded into the FMGC. This was not confirmed, however, as the FMGC had already removed that information from the flight plan.		It was the FO's leg, so I asked him to build the FMGC. Active departure Runway XX, FO programmed Runway XY (which was our landing runway a few minutes earlier). I did not detect the error in my FMGC review (I checked the departure heading of 210°, but missed the incorrect runway). Also, in the Before Takeoff Checklist, both the FO and I missed the runway programming error. Note, the FO requested and programed the correct runway data for Runway XX. After takeoff, the FO made a left turn, in accordance with flight director guidance. I was confused about the left turn guidance did not say anything to fix the error. Almost immediately ZZZ [TRACON] commanded an immediate turn to heading 180°, then subsequent right turns to north.		Air carrier flight crew reported receiving a low altitude alert issued by ATC during departure.

After exiting the affected airspace, both GPS receivers were still degraded and GPS updating was never reestablished. All of this is pretty typical for this flight. When my break ended, the Captain and flying FO briefed us on the situation and went on their break. After coasting out, we received a VERIFY POSITION message in the FMC scratchpad which made sense based on the increasing ANP value. Initially this message was acknowledged and cleared but after some browsing, found a FMC Position Update checklist in the unannunciated checklists and executed it. Step X of the checklist says to 'Select the NOW key for the most appropriate source.' The only option available at this step was 'inertial' at 2R which was selected because I thought surely the inertial position was more accurate than the FMC, and, incorrectly, I assumed this step was reversible. After selecting 'NOW', the ANP immediately jumped from 4.0 to >16 and we were unable to reset back to the original FMC position. We informed dispatch and all appropriate ATC agencies that we were no longer RNP 10.0 capable and the flight continued without incident and acceptable ANP values were reestablished after coast in.				Air carrier First Officer reported GPS jamming in international airspace resulting in loss of navigation accuracy in oceanic airspace.

Nobody got hurt. We were approximately 20 miles in trail of a 777. Approximately 50 minutes prior to the event, we encountered moderate wake turbulence from the same airplane.  We were offset 1 mi right of course, the other 777 was on course and 1000 feet above. The wind was quartering from the left at approximately 30 knots. Both the FO and I were surprised that we hit turbulence of that magnitude despite the fact that the wind was against us. After the first event, we removed the SLOP (Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure) and remained 1000 ft below and 20 mi in trail.  The wind had been quartering, however, at the time of the second event the wind display on the ND (Navigation Display) was showing calm wind. When the second encounter happened the onset was almost instantaneous and the turbulence encountered was significant.  We did not have time to make a PA announcement as we were both trying to ensure the airplane remained in control, which it did.  The autopilot kicked off and the airplane climbed 300 feet.  The airspeed fluctuations and pitch changes were not significant.  When I regained control of the plane I asked the FO to call the F/A's and check if there were any injuries.  All F/A's and PAX were unhurt.  After the event, we descended an additional 1000 ft and offset 10 nm left of course.  (The wx radar was on and there was no convective activity near us.  The turbulence was definitely wake turbulence.). I verbally debriefed with both Dispatch and the Chief Pilot.		I was sleeping in the bunk. All of a sudden everything went flying, including me. I thought 'I hope everyone is okay' and then I fell back asleep. I was later told it was because of wake turbulence from a 777 ahead of us.		B777 flight crew reported encountering severe wake turbulence 20 miles in trail of another B777 on their trans-Pacific flight.

At first we thought it was the outer pane of his escape window. He had the yellow sunshield extended, we could both see spider webbing glass. We were so close to the airfield with no additional traffic in the vicinity that we decided not to say anything to ATC rather than [request assistance]. Our rationale was that the best thing to do was get the plane out of the air as fast as possible and both focus on those procedures rather than inducing additional distraction or delay. On final, the Captain noted that little pieces of glass were falling off. It was then we realized the inner pane had broken. I mentally prepared myself to take the plane in the event the conditioning worsened, and the Captain was unable to continue flying. He made a smooth landing and we landed uneventfully. Once at the gate, we told the CSR who reported it to maintenance, then we contacted Maintenance Control and wrote it up.

After lift-off, on initial climb landing gear did not retract.  As pilot flying, I requested the First Officer tell ATC we needed a lower altitude level off and a heading away from weather as we accessed the problem and addressed the QRH.  Completing the QRH procedure, step X directs the crew to "open and close the manual gear extension access door."  Upon completion of this step, the landing gear operated normally and retracted as prescribed.  While completing the QRH for the landing gear disagree, it was noted that the "reverser" lights on the overhead panel were illuminated for engine 1 and 2.  We completed the "reverser" QRH procedure and the lights remained illuminated.  Although flight characteristics were normal and cabin crew reported visual inspection of the reversers to be normal, with compounding issues and communications to Dispatch and Maintenance Control limited, I made the command decision to return to the departure station of ZZZZ.  Approximately 10,000 lbs over landing weight, we [requested priority handling] and completed the appropriate overweight landing checklist and the non-routine landing considerations checklist.  Weather at the airport was VFR with favorable winds and the runway landing distance was reported.  We requested safety vehicles be present as a conservative precaution and asked they inspect the brakes after landing.  With operations normal, flight concluded at the gate without issue and at no time was safety compromised.				B737-800 Captain reported on initial climb a landing gear issue corrected via QRH, but further reverser warnings resulted in expeditious handling return to departure airport.

On GESNR STAR at 15k about 10 NM behind an A320 with nearly calm winds. During descent encountered significant wake turbulence resulting in a roll authority autopilot alert over a 30-second period. At first I called "check path" twice followed by "upset" as aircraft experienced bank oscillations of +/- 20 degrees. After automation was disconnected I requested and ATC approved an offset course to avoid further encounters. While the seat belt sign was on, the FAs were finishing up their final descent preparation. No injuries were experienced. ATC was notified.		On the GESNR 1 Arrival into IAH we entered the wake turbulence of a A320 that was flying 10 NM in front of us on the same arrival. We got the 'roll authority' alert, indicating that the autopilot is working at max capacity. We called "check path," disconnected the automation, and requested a vector from ATC to get relief from the continuous wake turbulence. ATC cleared us a 10-degree left deviation, and that solved the problem. We reviewed the roll authority QRH afterwards. No roll, pitch, or airspeed limitations were exceeded. Flight attendants said everything was good in the back. We did not enter any of the upset criteria, but did follow the upset callout plus steps to disconnect the automation.

I thought they would be passing but they turned on to the same course as us. We were faster - as the gap closed we started to encounter ripples of the aircraft's wake. The prevailing winds were left to right and as we gained on the traffic it seemed that the wake ripples increased. I felt we did not have enough time to request a clearance and in the interest of safety I decided to maneuver our aircraft left 1 mile to avoid the wake. I felt going right would increase the risk of flying directly into the preceding aircraft's wake and possibly putting us into an upset situation. We were one mile left of course for approximately 20 miles and returned to course. I did send a CPDLC message to Shanwick Oceanic to advise we were back on centerline of route. I do believe when we were maneuvering the route confirmation was sent and mistakenly accepted.Shanwick Oceanic should give aircraft some lateral distance crossing oceanic fixes.

Passing 5000 I witnessed the right engine oil qty plummet to 2 qts then bounce between1 - 3 qts.  The white title on the engine system page started flashing and the quantity periodically showed amber xx's but hovered around 1 qt.  We coordinated with ATC to halt the climb at 6000 ft and to put us in a box pattern so we didn't get too far from the airport in the event engine 2 failed.  We coordinated with dispatch on a precautionary return to ZZZ as opposed to continuing 3 hrs to ZZZ1 with the continued indications on Engine 2 and the uncertainty of the oil status. [Priority handling was requested], ATC was given the necessary information and we prepared the aircraft to return to ZZZ for a landing on runway XYL.  The FAs were given all the appropriate briefing information and then passengers were briefed accordingly.  As we had no ECAM procedure to follow and there is no QRH procedure for the situation and the engine oil temp was not showing an overheat and had pressure plus still generating thrust we elected to leave it running until instructed to shut it down - engine 2.

Finally we debriefed with a company representative performing the human factors checklist then debriefed as a crew.		On climbout, the captain noticed our oil quantity indicator for the right engine was dropping and beginning to flash as we passed through 5000 MSL on our climb up to 160000 MSL. He immediately requested a level off at 6000 MSL to ATC and a vector to keep us nearby the airport. The oil quantity gauge continued to fluctuate between 0-11 quarts of oil with the remaining indicators showing normal ranges. Uncertain of whether the indicator was accurate or not, we decided the safest course of action was to return to the field in the event the engine failed. I continued to fly the aircraft while the captain coordinated with dispatch and our flight attendants. Once all completing our descent and overweight landing checklists, and ensuring all steps had been completed, we returned to the field and conducted a normal visual approach to XYL for an overweight landing. After completing the landing, and ensuring brake temperatures were within normal parameters, we taxied to the gate without further issues. We then went through our parking procedures and debriefed on the situation with each other.		A320 flight crew reported a drop in the right engine oil quantity shortly after takeoff, resulting in a return to the departure airport.

We recycled the landing gear handle one time and the gear still did not extend.  We accomplished a go around with Tower then switched off to Approach Control requesting vectors and a climb to 5000'.  We received the L/G (Landing Gear) not down locked after the go around.  After completing after takeoff checklist and climb to 5000', the FO read and completed the ECAM.  The last step was for L/G gravity extension.  We prepared by reading the QRH and made preparations for a tow in to the gate.  We performed the L/G gravity extension on long final and made an uneventful landing to Runway XX at ZZZ.  We were able to exit the runway at Intersection 1, clear the runway and set the parking break while waiting for a company tow to the gate.  We contacted Dispatch and sent in a Maintenance Request code to Maintenance.  After the company tow arrived we referenced the tow in checklist from the QRH and got towed to the gate.				A320 Captain reported the landing gear failed to extend during final approach. The Captain executed a go around and completed a safe landing.

We made the necessary corrections and landed safely. The pairing we were flying was very intense and we flew 6 hours at night from ZZZZ.

Then cleared direct to ZZZZZ for the ZZZZZX arrival to 16000. I cannot recall if this was a "descend via" or "descend to" clearance. I however suspect "descend via" based on what happened next.Captain engaged flight level change because we wanted to get down faster to burn off gas. We calculated a required land fuel to be just below 575 (max land weight) and we were focused on that weight since we were very close.ZZZZZ had an at/above restriction of 18000 on the STAR. We were approaching ZZZZZ descending through 18000 and Center asked to the effect of "are we crossing ZZZZZ at 18000?" We replied with our altitude which was below 18 and descending close to 16000. They then asked "can we maintain VMC?" and we replied affirmative that we were VMC and could remain so. They then told us to maintain 16,000 and VMC. Nothing else was heard after this and received a frequency change. There was no other traffic in the area. Rest of the approach was uneventful.Complicating factors included 5 trip revisions (the original departure had moved by 36+ hours since awarded the trip), fatigue as we were delayed on departure for a late jet, a very complex STAR and approach along with 6 MELs, one requiring us to start the APU before landing. We were very focused on multiple tasks and likely missed an altitude step down fix.		Descending into ZZZZ, ZZZZ ATC cleared us to descend to 16,000 ft. Then we were cleared via ZZZZZX. ( we weren't given a descend via clearance) We had to burn fuel to get aircraft below MLGW. I selected FLCH to get down to 16,000 ft. When we leveled off at 16,000 ft the controller told us to maintain 18,000 ft. Note there is an altitude on the Star to be at ZZZZZ above 18,000 ft.We replied that we were level at 16,000. The controller asked if we were VMC. We were and replied that we were VMC. Controller told us to maintain 16,00O and descend via the ZZZZZX. At some point we were cleared direct ZZZZZ1.I will definitely be more cognizant of crossing altitude restrictions when using FLCH.The initial altitude descend clearance the way it was given was before the Star clearance and I gave priority to the descent clearance without looking ahead for altitudes above our 16,000 ft clearance.Cause: Altitude clearance below a down line fix at ZZZZZ at or above 18,000 ft on STAROur cleared to descend altitude was 16,000 ft well before ZZZZZ fix		Air carrier flight crew reported descending below assigned altitude during arrival and not meeting a fix crossing restriction. Flight complied with ATC instructions and continued descent.

Specifically, as we configured with flaps, the max maneuver/min maneuver speed bands converged with corresponding max/stall speed bars also converging on both Primary Flight Displays (PFDs). No 'IAS DISAGREE' msg, however I was unable to engage VNAV when cleared and as the bands converged it became apparent that we had a problem. I disconnected autopilot and around 2600' initiated a soft go around. As I was concerned with our stall margin, I did not change configuration until I was safely in climb with speed increasing. Our airspeeds were in sync with each other and the groundspeed so at that point I then performed full go around maneuver. We [requested priority handling] and once above the clouds I directed FO to the airspeed unreliable checklist. I suspected that icing was the culprit and as the FO ran the checklist we concurred that our airspeeds were accurate and it was likely an indication problem with our speed warning systems due to the icing. Both of our alternates had been reported as overcast (OVC), so we decided to reattempt an approach to ZZZ and requested vectors again for the ILS XXL. This time, I disengaged both the autothrottle/autopilot for the approach and asked the FO to monitor all airspeeds and call out anything less than 160kts(vref was 148). I flew the approach maintaining a higher than normal speed to stay above the min maneuver band. Since the Airspeed (AS) unreliable checklist didn't exactly reflect our situation, I decided that during the approach any stall warning indications would be respected. At some point during the approach we got the 'Leading Edge (LE) FLAPS TRANSIT' light on. As far as I know, we never exceeded any flap speeds or aircraft limits during the event. We landed, left the flaps down and had Airport Rescue and Firefighting inspect the aircraft, particularly our flight controls because we still had transit light. Everything appeared normal and we proceeded to our gate. Postflight inspection revealed some rime ice on the Leading Edge Devices (LEDs) and Maintenance discovered icing in the slat tracks. Cause: Icing. We had covered it in our brief and selected engine anti-ice but I never considered turning on the wing anti-ice and in retrospect realize that it may have mitigated some of our issues. Wing anti-ice is used so rarely that I tend to focus on the restrictions/limitations over the reasons to use it. Not anymore!                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Time. After [requesting priority handling] I felt time constrained because in the back of my mind I was concerned about our plan B. I knew the ceiling/vis should not be a problem getting into ZZZ, but was not sure how far we might need to go if we couldn't safely get below the OVC layer and needed an alternate with no ice on the arrival. In the rush to get back into the approach I did not give the Flight Attendants (FAs) a precautionary landing brief. I also opted to continue the approach with the transit light on because we knew it was icing related and that would take several minutes of checklist.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Checklist. The airspeed unreliable checklist was our initial response to the indications, however the checklist does not consider an event that presents initially as unreliable airspeed but then once checklist is completed we still encounter PFD speed warnings anomalies. I would recommend a decision tree that considers if all airspeed indications are accurate, that icing accumulation may be a factor and direct accordingly with winganti-ice and speed additives for approach.				A B737-800 pilot reported unreliable airspeed indications due to icing during initial approach. Flight crew went around and landed safely.

We encountered no more than light turbulence. However, the aircraft listed left, then right just enough to disconnect the autopilot. I immediately leveled the wings and reengaged the autopilot. The Captain thought I turned the autopilot off, as the upset didn't appear to be severe enough to disengage it. Nothing was said to us in flight regarding injuries. However, after blocking in, we were told that a Flight Attendant had potentially injured themselves during the event. The Captain filed an report in the crew room following the flight.

After conferring the decision was made to divert to ZZZ1 airport for recovery.Via HF (no CPDLC on this aircraft) we coordinated the diversion with ZZZ center and were given direct ZZZ1 airport. We consulted the manual to establish a degradation factor for landing performance and then applied that the landing data and consulted against the baseline numbers from the manual. I consulted with and briefed the Purser and made a PA to the customers which the Purser translated into another language. We then ran the Overweight Landing procedure as a precaution but landed under the max landing weight at ZZZ1. ZZZ1 ATC gave us our choice of runways so l asked for XXL. The approach and landing were normal with the loss of a few systems from the failure. We parked the aircraft as per the QRH procedure with no parking brake available.

Pushback, taxi out to Runway XXL at ZZZ was uneventful and normal. On climb out at approximately 9000 feet with the autopilots engaged, I noticed and felt the #2 engine rolling back and the REV amber light came on. I do not recall even getting a Master Caution though. I brought it to my FO's attention and announced "My aircraft". I turned off the autopilot and autothrottles so that I could have a better feel as to what was going on. The FO [requested priority handling] and he advised ATC we had something going on with our #2 engine and that we would be leveling at 10,000 feet to run some checklists. The engine was somewhat cycling or surging if the throttle was not at idle as the FADEC (Full Authority Digital Electronic Control) took control. I remained Pilot Flying while my FO went to the QRH checklist for REV (Reverser unlocked in flight) checklist. We both agreed that was the appropriate checklist and we accomplished that first. With the current indications and responses from the engine, we were directed to the "Engine failure or Shutdown checklist".That checklist was accomplished and we shut down the #2 engine and followed the remaining procedures. We still had some time before getting a returning vector back to ZZZ so I transferred control to the FO and accomplished the "Non routine landing  considerations" items Telling the FAs (Flight Attendants) our plan, telling the people a short summary, and finally sending the ACARS message to Dispatch. ATC had already been told we wanted Runway XXC in ZZZ and we began our vectoring back to an uneventful overweight single engine landing in ZZZ. As advertised, safety equipment was waiting for us as we turned on Taxiway 1 and stopped facing south on Taxiway 2. I made a PA to the passengers that we would be stopping for the safety equipment to give us a quick look over and to remain seated until we were back at the gate. We asked the Fire detail to look at our #2 engine for any visible leaks or damage which would prohibit us from taxiing to the gate. They indicated that everything looked ok and at that point we taxied to Gate XX. Parking and shutdown was uneventful and normal. I made an entry in the logbook. Maintenance met us shortly after and queried what we experienced and what we saw with the engine and told us they'd be taking it to the hanger.				B737-800 Captain reported engine failure along with FADEC and reverser lockout malfunctions during climb that resulted in a return to the departure airport.

I was flying with Captain. We are both ZZZ1 based pilots on the 737. Aircraft X was the last leg of a two-day trip.The sequence was very routine in nature. The inbound flight was delayed coming into ZZZ which obviously delayed our outbound flight. We were flying Aircraft X, which had MEL 49-XXX, for the APU BLEED AIR VALVE. Once we completed our preflight checks and were boarded, we conducted the supplementary procedure per the AOM for engine start. Other than the supplementary start procedure, it was just a routine push back and taxi. It was the captain's leg to fly, and we took off XXL out of ZZZ. Somewhere, around 9000-9500 feet, the captain noticed something wrong with the aircraft. It was at this point that I noticed the indication showing the #2 ENG REV was illuminated, with a loss of thrust on the #2 ENG, and the #2 throttle did not move via auto throttle. I believe the #2 EEC (Electronic Engine Control) took over the #2 ENG thrust when the Reverser indication illuminated, but I am not sure. The captain continued to fly the aircraft while I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ departure, requesting a level off at 10,000 feet and a heading, with an intent to return to ZZZ airport, and requested them to stand by while we figured out the issue and ran some checklists. Over the next few minutes, the #2 ENG REV indication did go away which then was accompanied by an increase in thrust to what was being commanded by the position of the #2 throttle, I believe. Once the #2 ENG spooled up, the #2 ENG REV indication re-illuminated, and accompanying loss of thrust on the #2 ENG. The cycle repeated itself maybe 2 or 3 times. There was a noticeable yaw in the aircraft but was controlled the captain flying. While this was going on I opened the electronic QRH in Comply, I did make a mistake opened the REVERSER 7.XX checklist, but quickly noticed my mistake as that was for ground operations, and then opened the correct REV 7.XY checklist. The captain continued to fly while I read the checklist. This then led us to the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist. It was around this time we began a decent to 8000 feet I believe. I then ran the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist which we completed for the #2 ENG. Once completed, I then ran the One Engine Inoperative Landing checklist, referencing how much landing distance would be required at which point I noted that it would additionally be an overweight landing. Once these were completed prior to the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist being completed, the captain and I swapped pilot flying duties vs pilot monitoring duties. The captain then notified dispatch of the issue, the flight attendants and the passengers on the situation and that we would be returning to ZZZ. During this time, I also began set up and reviewing for an approach to ILS XXC back into ZZZ. It was around this time I stated to ATC, Fuel on board, Passengers on board and the nature of the [situation] as well as stating we could begin our arrival into ZZZ. ATC gave us headings to complete a 360 degree turn prior joining XXC LOC.  It was around this time to the best of my recollection that the captain requested the aircraft back, and we swapped pilot flying vs pilot monitoring duties. I then ran the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist, as well as the Overweight Landing checklist. Once completed, we reviewed the approach plate for ILS XXC into ZZZ, as well as running the Before Landing Checklist. It was around this time we intercepted the XXC course for landing and began our approach. Once closer to the runway, I noticed ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting] and emergency response vehicles parked on the adjacent taxiways to XXC which then followed our aircraft after exiting the runway taxiway 1 off XXC. Once stopped, the captain requested the passengers remain seated while I communicated to ARFF command, requesting an inspection of the #2 ENG for any abnormalities. Once, the inspection was completed and they stated they didn't see any abnormalities, we cancelled out [priority handling] status. I then coordinated with ZZZ Company operations for an arrival gate of XX. The captain then began to taxi the aircraft towards XX with ZZZ ground instructions while I called the flights attendants and confirmed everyone was ok and that we would be going to Gate XX. Once, at the gate we completed the shutdown checklist. The captain made a logbook entry for the incident. He then spoke to the director. At which point we then booked tickets on the next ZZZ-ZZZ1 flight home as we had already gone over our over time for the day. This statement is the best recollection I have of the events as they happened for Aircraft X. I do believe the crew, as a whole, did an amazing job and I was fortunate to have completed my annual recurrent training recently, which made me feel that I had recency in dealing with [a situation] of this type. I do believe my Company has a great training program with knowledgeable individuals coming together to train us for when a situation like this arises.  No recommendations.

There was about a 3 knot tailwind and the far end of the runway was wet. The landing was normal with medium autobrake set as per the landing data. All was normal until we transferred control.  The first officer said it felt like the breaking action was reduced (or words to that effect) just as I took over control.  We had proceeded to the last third of the runway where it was considerably wetter than the touchdown and rollout area.  When I applied the brakes, I could feel the aircraft was not decelerating.  I took a quick look at the triple brake pressure indicator in case the brakes had failed, but the indicator showed good brake pressure so I realize we were hydroplaning.  I put the aircraft thrust back into full reverse to prevent a runway overrun. We did stop just in time to make our turn into the taxiway at the end of runway XX without blocking the traffic that was already there waiting to back taxi.  I had to leave reverse in place until nearly at a stop to ensure a safe stop. I did not see any limitations exceeded but felt I should submit this report just in case.  Following our landing, ATC turned the airport around.				Air carrier Captain reported hydroplaning on the runway during landing and using thrust reversers to a complete stop to prevent a wet runway overrun.

After clearing runway, FO stated there was an excessive amount of additional back pressure required to execute the landing flare.  On taxi in, we both conducted a full flight control check and both confirmed that there an unusual amount additional force required to full back.  Upon arrival to the gate, I called Maintenance Control to explain what we felt and advised the write up.Have a safe and properly functioning aircraft, with through maintenance checks besides just quick/ cheapest "ops check good" maintenance checks to get plane back flying as quick as possible instead of fixing the problem correctly the first time.		On landing in ZZZ I the FO was the PF at approximately 50 feet RA there was a slight amount of increased pressure which got significantly worse the lower we got to the ground. The greatest amount of pressure/tension was between 50 feet RA and the ground. I found it difficult to flare where my vast experience in the B737 aircraft knew this was not normal pressure on the 737. I told the CA and on taxi in he and myself did a standard flight control check and both noted that the travel of back elevator was greatly increased from what normal is.Have a working airplane in correct mechanical order and there won't be flight control issues.		B737-800 flight crew reported the flight controls required an abnormal amount of additional back pressure during landing flare.

During the left turn passing DOMNO and at approximately 8500 feet, we encountered bumpy air, the rate of turn rapidly increased, and going through 30 degrees of bank I disconnected the autopilot to manually correct. As I was transitioning to hand-flying, we received a 'bank angle' aural warning. The maximum angle of bank I saw was approximately 35 degrees. I corrected the flight path, the air was smooth again and I re-engaged the autopilot. The encounter felt like wake turbulence, and we queried Approach Control of the aircraft type we were following. On TCAS it appeared to be 5 miles in front of us. Approach responded that it was a 737 MAX 9. The flight continued without further incident.

I took my hands off the thrust levers but did inadvertently hold onto the yoke and pull back slightly..the nose came off the ground..I was able to put it back down as I gave the FO control of the aircraft.  He put his hands on the thrust levers also.  I was able to put my seat back in position at which point I took control of the throttles again..I made normal PM callouts of V1 and rotate (~157 & 167 kts).  The FO remained as PF until ~10,000ft and then we switched roles.  It was a startling sequence to both of us.My seat operation was completely normal during taxi-out including setting the parking brake several times before takeoff.I was assigned a XA:00 short call status following a Window of Circadian Low (WOCL) flight the day before. Because of the WOCL flight, crew scheduling was not able/legal to call me until XC:00 on this XA:00 short call which they did. I had declined a request to waive this WOCL--legal to assign protection from scheduling. I had a XB:20 wakeup for the previous pairing the day before the incident.  These factors did not affect how we handled the situation but fatigue was present.		Everything about the preflight, pushback, and taxi out was normal and routine. The CA was the pilot flying and I was the pilot monitoring. It was VMC with great visibility, dry, and very light winds (I don't recall the exact speed but it was single digit knots).Initially we were cleared to lineup and wait on runway 28L. We were within a few thousand pounds of MTOGW and configured for a flaps 5, bleeds on, derated thrust takeoff, I don't recall the speeds but I believe V1 was upper 150s and rotate was lower 160s. Once cleared for takeoff, all procedures and callouts were executed appropriately. Shortly after the '100 knots' callout, around 115 to 120 knots, the CA's chair slid all the way back and the CA was unable to keep his hands securely on the controls of the airplane.  When sliding back he bumped the control column back slightly, I did not notice any impact to the throttles. The plane started to move slightly right of centerline. In that moment I was ready to either take control of the aircraft or for him to reject the takeoff, and in that moment the CA declared 'YOU HAVE THE AIRCRAFT'. I grabbed the yoke and put my hands on the throttles momentarily as the CA went to pull his seat forward. I gently guided the airplane back to centerline as I observed our airspeed to continue to accelerate at a normal rate. With the CA hastily back in position he took the throttle back from my hand and verbalized 'my throttle' and reiterated that I am the PF and for me to just continue the takeoff and departure and he would assume the PM duties, which I acknowledged and silently agreed in the moment was the most prudent path forward.  The CA, now acting as the PM, then made the V1 and ROTATE callouts normally.  The rotation, liftoff, and departure were all normal, and we transferred aircraft control back to the CA and I went back to the PM role. The rest of the flight went uneventfully.  Once at cruise we discussed the situation to assess what exactly happened and what we might have done better.  The CA stated that because he saw me vigilant and ready at the controls, and the fact we were already in the high speed regime and he was not in a safe position to reject the takeoff anyway, that he felt it was best for me to take aircraft control and continue the takeoff. Neither of us were sure if the throttles had been unintentionally, momentarily retarded as the CA slid back, but after I had taken control of the aircraft we agreed that it was accelerating normally although neither of us explicitly verified the takeoff power was set correctly and verbalized it. We agreed that attempting a high speed abort in that situation under the pretense of 'unsafe to fly' would have been a much more dangerous alternative, and although we could have executed the scenario better than we did, we thought we were more correct to do what we did and ultimately successful. The CA repeatedly tested his chair to ensure it was locked in place and could find no issues with his seat, it seemed to be in good working order. We concluded it must just have not been originally locked into a set position and it was in a 'between' position (if that makes sense), and as we accelerated on the takeoff roll, the force was enough to break the friction in the mechanism and send him backward.We called back to the flight attendants and spoke to the lead to inform him what had happened and to see what he had perceived in the back of the aircraft. He stated that he felt a very noticeable 'bump' and in that instant thought that we might have been rejecting the takeoff, but then we clearly didn't and he was curious what was going on and was glad we could inform him. The CA and I agreed that what was perceived as a bump was very likely when the CA knocked back the yoke as he slid backward in his chair.		B737 NG flight crew reported the First Officer continuing the takeoff after the Captain's seat rolled back during the takeoff roll at approximately 120 kts.

As soon as the A-350 crossed over the top of our crossing runway, we were given takeoff clearance… right into the wake of the A-350 that just crossed over the top of our runway approximately 2000 down our runway. We started our takeoff roll very slowly because of my concern of the crossing aircraft's wake turbulence. As we accelerated, our indicated airspeed went up to 80 kt. and then decreased 20 kt. as we went through the wake turbulence of the A-350… my exact concern and I was aware of this possibly happening. Our takeoff roll continued normally as our airspeed increased.My question is, why is there not any wake turbulence separation for aircraft taking off when a larger widebody aircraft crosses over the top of a departing aircraft. After all, the landing aircraft is still producing wake turbulence that is descending right into our takeoff runway and path.One would think that with the runway configuration in IAD, taking off 30 and landing 1C, and other similar airport runway configurations, that there would be some concern of wake turbulence from landing aircraft on 1C affecting the takeoff roll of aircraft departing on Runway 30 - a crossing runway. I would think that a very small aircraft like a Caravan departing on 30 Right after a heavy landing on 1C would encounter some wake turbulence from the heavy landing on 1C because the Caravan would take off quicker right into the crossing aircraft's wake turbulence.My suggestion would be to not allow aircraft to depart Runway 30 if a heavy is landing 1C without having some type of wake turbulence separation. I understand the runways do not technically "cross" each other, but the flight paths cross each other.

ATC advised we were following a heavy 777 and caution wake turbulence. We were IMC at the time and the deceleration was appropriate to obtain spacing. As we got close to PATRN at 3000 feet, aircraft experienced an uncommanded roll. As the PF I disconnected automation to level the wings. The result was no significant loss of altitude, 20 feet maybe, and no real loss of airspeed. Advised ATC we encountered the wake turbulence and could continue the approach. Automation was returned to normal and were able to fly the remainder of approach without incident, but encountered more, but minor wake turbulence throughout the rest of approach. The track to PATRN deviated maybe 5 - 7 degrees, but this was only a rolling event.				B737 NG Captain reported encountering wake turbulence on final approach to EWR in trail of a B777.

It was night time with very gusty winds but VFR conditions. We overshot final and were given a vector back to intercept. Our energy state was appropriate. Autopilot was on and APP (Approach) was appropriately armed. We were fully configured with the Before Landing Checklist complete approximately 1.7 NM from the FAF. About 3 seconds after GS intercept (2100' MSL; ~7 NM from touchdown), the Autopilot commanded a climb. We climbed approximately 200 feet, then the Autopilot commanded an aggressive descent. Vertical Velocity Indicator reached 2000 FPM momentarily and slightly more than 2 dots below glideslope. First Officer PF appropriately turned off the Autopilot, raised the nose, maintained airspeed, and climbed to reassure the glideslope. We were never below 1000' AGL, and were stable by 1000' AFL. Looking back, we think that a better decision may have been to execute an immediate go-around with such a serious Autopilot malfunction. Alternatively, we could have turned off the Autopilot slightly sooner. However, we were VMC and felt that it was safe to continue once reassuring the glideslope. The landing was uneventful.Unknown causal factor; however, disengaging the Autopilot during gusty wind conditions or even after the initial uncommanded climb occurred may have prevented the increased vertical speed.				B737-800 First Officer reported the Autopilot malfunctioned on an approach resulting in a temporary loss of control. Flight crew disengaged the Autopilot and continued the approach.

The PAPI was out of service, moderate and heavy rain was present, and wipers were set to high.  Once visual contact was made with the runway I turned off autopilot and continued.  The runway had edge lights, but I don't recall seeing TDZ or centerline lights.  It was difficult to see the runway surface as the aircraft approached touchdown.  I noted that the tempo of RA callouts had increased so I initiated an immediate round out and flare.  In hindsight, I did not have enough visual cues to realize that touchdown was imminent and the touchdown was firm.  Post flight inspections did not reveal any irregularities and after reviewing onboard approach and pitch reports and the Hard Landing reporting requirements in the AOM we discussed that it was a firm landing, but did not warrant further action. A FOQA gate keeper later informed us that the touchdown was considered a hard landing.  The gate keeper explained that he would notify Maintenance Control directly.Cause: The lack of visual cues and reduced visibility due to rain on the windshield led to a situation where the aircraft was closer to the runway surface than anticipated.  Without a PAPI or TDZ lights it was difficult to judge closure rate.  I would recommend that crews go around if this situation occurs to avoid misjudging the time available to round out and flare.  I also recommend adding a quantitative method for pilots to use when determining if a landing is deemed a "Hard Landing".		Hard landing in ZZZ, confirmed by FOQA data. Uneventful flight until approach through touchdown. Heavy rain and PAPIs out of service on RWY XXL led to minimal visual cues for landing. FO recognized faster than normal pace of automated verbal cues "30, 20, 10" and executed late flare, resulting in very firm touchdown. Highest VVI (Vertical Velocity Indicator) I observed was 950. We confirmed no injuries with the flight attendants and referenced FOM and available onboard landing data before deciding not to make a logbook entry. FOQA call the next day informed us of 2.5 Gs upon landing, greater than inspection limit of 2.1. FOQA rep agreed to inform Maintenance Control on our behalf.  Cause: Causal factors included lack of visual cues due to heavy rain with wipers on high, no PAPIs, poor runway lighting, no verbal prompts from me and late flare execution. Recommend I speak up next time to highlight need to flare or direct go-around. With my newly calibrated internal G-meter, I will also add any similar-feeling landings to the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook). It would be nice to have onboard G-meter visibility to prevent the need for subjective estimation.		B737-800 flight crew reported a hard landing at night in the rain.

The approach was on path and speed with the 1000 foot call being stable and the 500 foot call on target speed with a sink rate of 700-800 feet. The landing approach to 50 feet was stable. At around 50 feet the descent was not arrested I called for the First Officer to flare and on the second flare call. I applied a little back pressure to the yoke to stop the descent but the yoke felt soft with play in the travel. The plane had a hard landing but was kept center lane and came to a normal stop off on Taxiway 1. We parked at Gate XX where I called the Dispatcher to get guidance on the proper steps on how to proceed and get the write up taken care of as well as notifying Maintenance in ZZZ1 headquarters. On the post flight discussion the FO indicated the yoke required back extra back pressure on the flare.Cause: The yoke back pressure issue was written up two times prior to our event. Which I believe was one of the factors.		We received clearance to conduct a visual approach to Runway XXR. We backed up the visual approach with the ILS XXR procedure and captured the localizer and glideslope to the final approach segment. At 1100 AGL the autopilot was disengaged. At 1000 AGL the aircraft configured was on target approach speed and met stable approach criteria. At 500 AGL the aircraft again was stable, on target approach speed with a sink rate of 700-800 FPM. At 40 AGL, I (PF) initiated a flare by applying back stick pressure. The control feel was sluggish, soft with play, and the amount of back stick pressure applied did not significantly affect the sink rate. The Captain called, "Flare" while descending past 30 AGL. I (PF) applied more back stick pressure to arrest the sink rate while simultaneously retarding the throttles towards idle power. Descending past 20 AGL the Captain called, "Flare, Flare" and assisted on the yoke to apply back pressure. The continuous effort to arrest the sink rate with back pressure on the yoke control was insufficient and resulted in a hard landing. The aircraft was controlled on centerline and came to a normal stop on Taxiway 1. The aircraft taxied to park at Gate XX. The Dispatcher was informed of the suspected hard landing, an AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) entry was created detailing the excessive back pressure required during landing and a post flight inspection was performed. Cause: Three previous AML entries were made regarding the aircraft requiring excessive back pressure. These entries were closed on the AML prior to Aircraft X being accepted. The AML entries were discussed by the PF and PM as possible threats. The flight control test after engine start yielded no signs of abnormal back pressure required for elevator control. Additional corrective actions by maintenance to mitigate excessive back pressure required on yoke may have potentially reduced risk.		B737-800 flight crew reported a hard landing due to the yoke malfunctioning.

I had told the Flight Attendants to remain seated because of possible turbulence. The were no injuries or damage.Cause: Aircraft was very heavy and full TO (Take-off) was used.

With all the issues going on simultaneously we caught the aircraft descending through FL290 and stopped the descent at FL287 and climbed right back to FL290. Autopilot was reengaged and no further incident and ATC said nothing.		[Report narrative contained no additional information.]		B737 NG flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence that disconnected the autopilot at FL310 from an aircraft 5 - 7 NM ahead that was on the same route. While descending through FL290, the flight crew saw the other aircraft and climbed back to FL290 and reengaged the autopilot.

The radar was on and we were not painting any weather.  My Weather App was also showing no convective weather along our route.  The turbulence lasted for approximately 30 seconds.  I immediately asked the flight attendants to be seated over the PA.  The airplane quickly lost energy in the turbulence and then pitched over aggressively to regain speed.  We lost approximately 400-500' before the first officer (who was the flying pilot) disengaged the auto pilot and very carefully arrested our sink rate.  When clear of the turbulence, we immediately climbed back to 37000' and reported our turbulence encounter and altitude loss to ARINC (Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated).  They acknowledged our message.  We called the cabin and checked on the crew and passengers and everyone was fine.				A320 Captain reported encountering moderate turbulence resulted in loss of airspeed and altitude with momentary loss of aircraft control.

TOW (Take-off Weight)/144.1. XXX SOB (Souls on Board).  We were cleared for Takeoff and Power was set to 89.7. First Officers Takeoff. At approximately 110 knots Master Caution light illuminated as Pilot Monitoring I looked up and saw AFT ENTRY warning light illuminated, I stated 'Reject my aircraft' Pulled the throttles to idle simultaneously disconnecting auto throttles, confirmed Speed Brakes deployed, full reverse thrust, and RTO (Rejected Take-Off) brakes applied. The reject was successful all procedures followed and ATC Transmissions made per SOP. We cleared the runway at Taxiway 1 approximately halfway down the runway. No injuries and no aircraft damage.  Outside air temp was +28, brake on at approximately 110kt, GW (Gross Weigh) 144.1. Once clear of runway and stopped, made a PA to passengers and informed them of why we stopped, reassured them all is OK and remain in their seats with seatbelts fastened and that we had to return to the gate. At the apron Spot X, we shut down the aircraft and were met by airport personnel, Maintenance and we completed a walk around to check on brake temperatures and cooling times. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was nearby even though they were not requested but in hindsight probably should have requested them after the reject just in case the brakes heated up. We did check the brake cooling chart and concluded that the threat of thermal plugs, brake temperatures did not require ARFF supervision, however out of caution I the Captain should have requested them just in case. I made an AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) entry in logbook stating reason for reject, speed brakes applied approximately 110kts, GW144.1 and outside temp of +28. Along with Master Caution and AFT ENTRY illumination. As the Captain, I made my decision to reject based on numerous factors. First, I knew we had over 1X,000ft of runway and that stopping on the runway would not be a factor, Second, considered aircraft not fit for flight because it was an aft entry door and not knowing if the door opened or not played a role in my decision. Since the aft door is located near the tail and critical flight controls did not want to get airborne and complicate the event. Therefore, used Captain Authority to make the decision to reject. As event was occurring, I did consider the threat of hot brakes and continuously and immediately checked to see if it would play a factor once the aircraft was safely stopped and all procedures were followed. First Officer ran the brake chart and it was determined that hot brakes were not an immediate fire hazard and that we required approximately 40 min of cooling time. After the event was over and back in the chocks, engines shutdown, Maintenance doing their inspection, 1 of the passengers that did have a heart condition was not feeling well, so ground personnel removed him from flight and took control of him. No immediate life-threatening conditions were noted other then he felt weak and light headed and requested to be taken off the flight. Which we complied with. I was also met with a ZZZZ aviation safety person who did not speak very good English that requested a handwritten account of the event, which I complied with and signed but was not presented with a copy of the form. With all of the logistical issues of Maintenance, passenger control and company inquiries things were very busy. To compound the issue it was our 3rd leg that day of a 4day trip and we were facing timing out for duty day. It was the last leg of the trip and we didn't have much time left. Since, we do not routinely remain overnight in ZZZZ and considering the passengers limited options for successfully getting to ZZZ, we the pilots agreed to extend our duty day by 2hr and tried to complete the flight. After a lengthy delay, we were able to get the aircraftsigned off by Maintenance and continue the flight to ZZZ. Cause: Pilot fatigue definitely played a role in this, but thankfully it all ended well. To mitigate risk, crew pairings should not be scheduled routinely right up to the maximum allowed by the FAR's. It does not allow any room for error and ultimately results in reducing time for crew to get adequate meals, rest between flights and during overnights. When delays happen for anything, company routinely reduces the time between flights and takes the delays out of crew down time between flights and during overnights further compounding the fatigue issue. This builds up over a 3,4,5 day trip and you end up with a fatigued crew pushing limits thy should never have to do. It is not a safe practice, but a practice that optimizes the company's utilization of every possible minute a flight crew is a legally available. It's not safe and really needs to be stopped before something critical happens. Our only recourse is to call fatigued, but if you do it routinely you could be putting your career on the line. Not a mindset an aircrew should be faced with when determining FIT FOR DUTY. FAR duty limits are just that. Limits. They should not be allowed to routinely schedule trips to fly continuously right up to those limits.  When you complete trips they way they are scheduled now crew members are completely exhausted approaching the last day of a trip because of compounding factors over a 3,4,5 day sequence that results in a fairly fatigued crew rejecting at high speed on the last leg of a 4 day trip.  Also the time during overnights are based on block in to block out times. Example: Land at XA:00 and next leg departure is scheduled for a XM:00 takeoff, therefore your time during overnight is 12hrs. Sounds reasonable, however factor in that it takes on average 1hr to get from setting brakes to get to the hotel and now you are down to 11hr rest, then factor in another 30 min to check in, get changed and think about getting something to eat, now you have 10.5hr rest, then assuming you can find somewhere to get something to eat, factor 1hr to sit and try and enjoy a meal now you are at 9.5hr, then plan on a van time that will get you to sign in 1hr prior to flight, so backup your wake up time to allow for shower, and packing up to be in lobby by van time and at a minimum that 2.5hr prior to departure so you are now down to 7hr of sleep. Assuming you can immediately fall asleep based on the timeline which never happens. This leaves crews getting an average of about 5-6hr of sleep at night assuming no hotel interruptions.  Now do the same over 3 days and note that each day may have 2 to 3 legs which throughout the trip have issues with delays that eats away at crew members times to get food in between flights or just stretch their legs. Bottom line, the schedules are becoming more and more demanding with the companies trying to squeeze every legal minute out of a crew member to so call 'Optimize' the schedule and increase profits and it is becoming a very dangerous, unhealthy practice that is leading to more fatigue calls and overall unhealthy lifestyle for a profession that requires the highest medical standards. This in my opinion will someday lead to a fatigued crew member pushing the limits because of fear for calling fatigued too many times, financially loss or just trying to take care of the passengers and will lead to an aircraft accident. It is becoming more and more common place to schedule and push these limits. I hope that someone will look into the FAR Duty Day and flight day limits and set new guidelines that track crew rest times with clear start and end points. Example. My 12hr overnight rest should be started based on the avg time it takes to arrive at the hotel and should run to sign in. Not block to block. Examine this practice further and you will see more and more crew members are experiencing the same issues and fatigued pilots are becoming the normal. Last thing anyone wants is a malnourished, fatigued pilot making critical decisions at key times like a rejected takeoff. I hope something changes.

We were also getting a master warning light that kept illuminating without an ECAM. No audio was observed either. We never felt any pitch or speed changes and assumed flaps were still at zero. We called maintenance and they agreed that it was an indication issue. Everybody agreed that continuing to ZZZ was the best option.  Upon arrival in ZZZ we slowed and deployed the slats via flap 1 selection. The slats moved to .5 and moved slowly. We decide to take a vector northbound to configure to flaps 3.  We ended up with .5 slats and 2.5 flaps with the flap selector at three. We still had no ECAM and had to improvise a procedure assuming that what was indicating was true. We referenced the flight control flaps locked procedure which yielded a flaps three landing and +25 knots to our approach speed. We [requested priority handling] due to the higher approach speed and took the longest runway (XXR) into ZZZ.  The landing was uneventful and we taxied to the gate without incident. While dealing with this we switched runways from XXL to the offset approach for XXR. I loaded the approach and extended a course from ZZZZZ. ZZZ approach told us to maintain 8000 until established and cleared approach. I armed the final approach mode and the plane descended before the 8000 foot restriction at ZZZZZ2 because ZZZZZ2 wasn't loaded. ATC noticed our altitude and reissued a clearance to maintain 7000 until established. If I would have done anything differently, I would have stuck with our original plan to land on XXL. We had plenty of runway to safely land in our un-standard configuration and our workload was high with improvising a procedure for our condition.		Approximately half way through our flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ at FL 340 we noticed that the slat/flap indicator was amber and flashing. Underneath the flap symbol indicated 0 and underneath the F symbol had two xx 's. We did not receive an ECAM message. The master warning light was flashing intermittently. The captain talked to Maintenance Control over the radio. Maintenance Control suggested that we continue to ZZZ and suspected a faulty indicator. The captain and I briefed a couple of possible scenarios prior to arrival into ZZZ. We planned to configure the aircraft early to allow time to address any threats.We positioned the flaps to 1 and the slats slowly came down but only to around .5 ( still no ECAM message of any sort). We asked for vectors to the north for some additional time. We slowed to 180 and selected flaps 2. Then slowed to 170 and selected flaps 3. At this point the flaps only went to around 2.5. We [requested priority handling] and asked to go direct to the airport. We decided to stay at flaps 3 and followed the abnormal procedure. We were cautious of our speed and per the performance charts flew at VREF + 25. ATC asked if we would like XXR vs XXL (which we were originally set up for). We entered the RNAV Y into the box. ATC cleared us for the approach and told us to maintain 8,000 until ZZZZZ. We transferred the controls back to the captain. ATC called us asking what altitude we were at and we noticed that we were at 7,400 feet. ATC then said to maintain 7,000 until ZZZZZ1. The landing was very smooth, we didn't require any additional support and taxied to the gate.		A320 flight crew reported a malfunction with the flap control and indication system inflight.

Approximately 24000 ft. an extremely bright white light emanated from the top of the windshield and became larger and brighter. Initially I thought we were hit by an extremely bright and powerful laser, much stronger than a typical pen laser, but shortly realized this was a window arc that turned into something so bright I have not experienced before. I have had several window arc events in my career and at least 2-3 window delaminations. This was something much more severe. Fearing for my First Officer's (FO's) immediate safety, I immediately removed the power source from the window, and the bright light almost immediately reduced in intensity. After a minute of discussing what actually occurred, my FO thought it was a fire, there was a very loud boom and immediately I saw the windshield cracked severely. I pulled out the QRH, advised ATC and [requested priority handling]. I also asked to be given headings to fly and altitudes and to be taken off the arrival. After pulling out the QRH the FO ascertained the outer pane was broken and the inner pane was undamaged. I followed the QRH and worked radios while the FO continued flying. After completing the QRH, and further into the arrival, I advised FO due to his windshield cracks that I would be doing the landing. I also advised the FO to put his goggles on in case the windshield became further damaged, at least he would have extra eye protection. We landed uneventfully, wrote up the event, talked to Maintenance in ZZZ, I called Maintenance Control, and then the duty pilot to provide additional info.Suggestions: I thought we handled the situation as good as we could have.		During the descent in arrival at flight level 240, I noticed a small dot of light on the upper corner of my windshield, which gradually became bigger, brighter, and appeared similar to fire on wire. Whole cockpit was bright. Imagining various possibilities such as traffic or an external light source, I soon realized this was not the case. It was something like electrical fire. It was something bright and also melting texture.We were maintaining a speed of 290-300 kts., with the speed restriction previously deleted by ATC. The Captain decided to turn off the window heat for the R1 window. Approximately 30 seconds later, we heard a noise akin to an explosion like "BOMm" and the window cracked. In response, I grabbed my O2 mask and we [requested priority handling], after QRH requested vectors for ILS XX at ZZZ Airport. The situation was managed smoothly thereafter. As the First Officer and pilot flying (PF), I transferred control to the Captain and donned my smoke goggles to protect my eyes if something else happened.		B737-800 flight crew reported during descent, the right windshield started arcing and the outer pane cracked. They advised ATC and ran the QRH.

At about 34500 feet, we were hit by wake turbulence and at the same time TA alert went off. I pulled the speed brake out and put hands on throttle and yoke. I was ready to disconnect autothrottle and autoflight. Mach number increased from .78 to .82 for couple seconds. The wake passed, we leveled off at FL350 and told ATC about the wake. Landed in ZZZ, maintenance log filled, and had maintenance team checked out the jet. No damage was found. We flew the same jet later to ZZZ1. Our Purser called us during the encounter of the wake and stated his safety concerns for himself and passengers. Seatbelt sign was on when the event occurred. He told us passengers were at the aisle and he almost got hurt. We didn't know passengers were not complying with the seatbelt sign neither the cabin crew informed us before the event. Announcements were made whenever seatbelts sign turned on. We noticed the Purser was getting upset and emotional so my Captain asked the Purser to come to the cockpit so we can talk about the event but he refused. After we landed in ZZZ, Flight Attendant's Supervisor was involved and we had a conversation. We had no problem working together and continued the next flight to ZZZ1. CRM is one of the most important factors for flying safely. Stay calm and be professional are the foundation of a safe crew member.		We descended to FL310 to avoid an area of reported turbulence in the ABQ sector. Once past the area we requested a climb back to FL330 initially as it was again reported smooth. During the climb ATC recommended and offered FL350 as it was also smooth and we accepted. At roughly 34300 feet we got a TCAS alert and that was immediately followed by a sudden jolt of turbulence and then an overspeed as we apparently went through the descending wake turbulence of an aircraft above. Flying pilot did a good job of immediately getting through speed brake out and I assisted by opening the speed window and lowering the set speed. At roughly Cost Index (CI) 40 - 50 we were initially climbing around Mach .78 and the aircraft accelerated to and slightly above the limit briefly. We got the aircraft back on path and made a report to ATC about the wake event. Made a maintenance entry. Inspection was completed in ZZZ and safe to continue next leg.During the wake event itself I got a chime from the flight attendants which I initially did not answer as we wanted the aircraft back on path and then got. 6 - 7 chimes rapidly as the event concluded. I informed the Flight Attendant (FA) I was dealing with an issue and would call right back. When I did the FA was irate, erratic, and using unprofessional language. My primary concern during this call was to determine if everyone was ok and that no one was hurt. I was assured that was the case. It was clear to me there was a breakdown in communication and general CRM and I requested that the Purser join us in the flight deck so we could have a face-to-face discussion in an attempt to repair. The Purser refused initially and said he needed some time. I said to just let me know when he was ready. We ended up debriefing with a FA Supervisor and the Purser before our next flight.		B737 flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence during cruise flight in ZAB airspace and at the same time, there was an event happening in the cabin due to some passengers not wearing seat belts when the turbulence occurred.

The number 2 engine filter bypass light illuminated. The First Officer was the PF, so I referenced and actioned the QRH. The filter bypass light checklist is very short, and as we would be reducing thrust in an engine and possibly shutting down, I immediately requested a descent to FL310. After retarding the thrust, the bypass light became intermittent at varying amounts of thrust. I then notified Dispatch and coordinated with my Dispatcher and Maintenance. Maintenance advised me to follow the QRH, but with an intermittent light gave me oil pressure and temperature parameters to monitor. After descending to FL 270 and being cleared to descend via the ZZZZZ the bypass light became steady and I noted an increase in oil temperature we elected to [request priority handling] and shut down the engine per the QRH Engine Shutdown checklist. The checklist calls for landing at the nearest suitable airport. As we were already cleared to descend and had briefed the arrival into ZZZ3 we decided that ZZZ3 would be the best option for landing and would prevent the introduction of new threats inherent in a diversion. I briefed the flight attendants with no special instructions and no further issues expected after landing. We descended via the ZZZZZ arrival, I took over the flying duties and landed uneventfully on Runway XXR in ZZZ3. We taxied to Gate and deplaned normally. Maintenance write up was completed and Chief Pilot called for debrief.				B737 NG Captain reported landing safely after shutting down the number 2 engine as a precaution following the illumination of the filter bypass light and increased oil temperature.

We took action and made announcements and seat belt sign on and asked the Fas to be seated as well.   Approx 3-5 minutes later we started getting turbulence moderate which quickly changed to severe    We asked atc for lower and were unable 330 due to traffic and were told 90 seconds before we could descend .  We were proactive and had already slowed to Mach .75 .   We lost about 200 feet and gained 30-50 knots on airspeed indicator and then gained over 200 feet within seconds .   After about 45 seconds I asked atc how much longer to descend and that we were in severe turbulence .  Was told 30 more seconds due to traffic in area.   The VSI was pitching upwards to 1200-1700 feet per minute however we only gained around 200feet and but airspeed then lost 30-40 knots.  Autopilot was on and did a great job of correcting.   Seat belt sign was on prior to encounter and after about 30-45 seconds we were given permission to descend to fl330.   We were out of severe at approx 34400 feet and once below fl340 it was fairly smooth down to fl330 .     We then had Fas check in and no injuries and no passengers were up during the event .  I then notified dispatch we had descended to Fl330 as we did not have as we did not have a lot of reserve fuel .   I then began messaging dispatch all the relevent info .  Wrote up a Mx report and the rest of flight was uneventful.		While cruising along at FL350 just prior to reaching ZZZ, I was pilot flying and noticed on our weather software a red dot up ahead at FL360 and lots of orange dots scattered around about 15 minutes in front of us.  We had been having off and on smooth to light chop so the seatbelt sign was off at the current time. I turned the seatbelt sign on and the PA was made.  We asked ATC about the rides ahead, and were told light to occasional moderate but 330 was a better ride but not smooth.  I made the PA 'flight attendants take your jump seats in 2 minutes', and started my timer.  I then selected speed to Mach .76. The FO asked ATC to descent to FL330, we were told it would be a few minutes due to traffic below us.  About 12 minutes after I started my timer we started getting constant moderate turbulence, that then progressed to severe turbulence.  The FO asked ATC again about descending to FL330, stating we were in severe turbulence. ATC replied about 30 more seconds due to traffic below us. On the PFD we were showing airspeed fluctuations between a gain and loss of 30-40 knots, fortunately we had a large buffer between VMO with the airspeed at .76 turbulence penetration speed, so we never over-sped the aircraft.  We also had an altitude gain and loss of 200 feet, while the vsi was showing rapid and abrupt changes between 1200 ft/min climbs and descents. I believe we were in the severe turbulence for about 2-3 minutes before ATC was able to get us FL330. The FO set the altitude and we immediately descended to FL330.  Passing thru about FL345 it started smoothing out to light chop again.  I asked the FO when he could get a message typed to send it to dispatch to let him know about the severe turbulence. We leveled at FL330, ATC asked about the ride, injuries and aircraft damage. I called the FAs and asked if everyone was ok in the back.  They said everyone was fine as everyone was seated and I told them to stay in their seats and I would do the check in PA when appropriate. We reported to ATC and dispatch.  We had a Jumpseater, I asked them if they noticed anything that I missed as jumpseaters usually see the bigger picture when they aren't focused on flying. They agreed with what we had discussed about the altitude and airspeed deviations and large trend vector changes and the time frame of the turbulence. After discussing more with dispatch and looking over the FOM info, we input a maintenance entry for the severe turbulence.  I informed the purser that the turbulence we encountered was considered severe and she might get some phone calls or need to fill out some paperwork as well, so to check her manual. The rest of the flight continued uneventfully.  Once we landed in ZZZ, after parking I called the Chief Pilot per FOM guidance.		Air carrier flight crew reported encountering severe turbulence resulting in loss of aircraft control. The flight crew regained control of the aircraft and proceeded to their destination.

After completing the checklist, we accepted an approach to overweight landing onto runway XX into ZZZ. We landed and stopped on the runway with fire command providing a visual and thermal inspection of the plane. They noted a glowing red intake on the APU inlet.

The Captain investigated and found first class area flooded. When he returned to the flight deck he reported that the shutoff valve did not stop the leak. Due to extent of flooding we requested a diversion to ZZZ1 and [priority handling was requested]. An overweight landing on runway XX was made with a rate of 550 feet per minute and light braking. During rollout, water from first class area entered the flight deck. Generator two faulted with GEN OFF BUS and SOURCE OFF BUS illuminated. APU started and remained online during taxi to the gate. Airport fire and rescue inspected brakes and determined they were not overheated before taxiing to gate.Factors that caused this event were the leaking lavatory faucet. This event may be mitigated by flight attendant training on leaking faucet procedures				B737-800 First Officer reported a lavatory water flooding that migrated to the flight deck resulted in expeditious handling diversion and generator failing.

Myself nor the FO were able to ever identify the traffic visually. As the Stearman turned final for XXR we got a TCAS RA to CLIMB. Performed TCAS escape maneuver and then rolled right into a standard go-around. ATC instructed us to fly heading 040 and maintain 4,000 ft. It was very busy in the traffic pattern and ATC seemed to forget about us. We were headed straight for terrain and I immediately told ATC we needed a vector away from the terrain.   We had issues getting the FMC setup for the subsequent approach. ATC then told us to cross ZZZZZ at 5,300 and cleared us for the RNAV XXL Y approach. The AP was on at this point but started to descend below the 5,300 feet. Airspeed also began to decay. I disconnected AP and AT and began manually flying the aircraft to a safe approach and landing.		While on the RNAV Y XXL to ZZZ, ATC notified us that a Stearman was on a dogleg to XXR. We did not have the aircraft in sight and never called the aircraft in sight and we were on an instrument approach (in VMC). The RNAV Y XXL approach is offset to the right and at about the moment of the incident, our approach path was crossing the extended centerline for XXR. We were fully configured to land and inside 5 miles when we noticed a TCAS hit a few hundred feet below us, but it was inconsistent and disappeared and reappeared. At about 4 miles from the runway we received the TCAS RA and executed a go-around. After the go-around, I announced TCAS RA to tower. We were switched to approach control who gave us a turn to the east at 4,000 ft and queried the go-around. It seemed like after that point, ATC forgot about us as we headed right for a mountain and CA asked for a turn when we became uncomfortable with the situation. We then executed a visual approach backed up with the RNAV Y XXL approach and landed without further issue.		Air carrier flight crew reported an airborne conflict during final approach with an intruder aircraft. After complying with a TCAS RA the flight crew obtained a new clearance to a safe landing.

Writing this after reviewing the CEFA (Cockpit Emulator for Flight Analysis) data and discussing with FOQA gate keepers and concurring with their recommendation.  We were arriving at ZZZ with wind gusts 40+ KTS and a LLWS adversary.  I was pilot monitoring and the CA was the pilot flying.  There were some initial issues with getting set up on the approach that put us a little behind the aircraft.  The conditions were visual and we were able to get situated on the approach by final approach fix with all the checklist completed and configured for landing.  Through 1000 ft we were stable.  At about 800 ft I saw a rapid increase in speed and even called out 'watch speed'.  This speed deviation was only momentary and expected with the high gusty winds reported.  The CA was able to get the speed under control in a timely fashion and we were in visual conditions so didn't feel the need to call a 'Go-around'.  We were stable passing through 500 ft and everything looked good.  We then got multiple GPWS warnings on short final where we both confirmed the flap handle settings multiple times, grabbing and pointing at it.  I must assume we looked at the flap indication gauge but were victims of confirmation bias.  We continued to land, which in the moment I agreed with since we were on short final/in position to make a safe landing, in challenging weather conditions at a busy airport, the plane seemed to be flying fine and we both confirmed multiple times incorrectly that we had the correct flap setting.  On roll out when we reached a safe taxi speed I noticed that the flap gauge was at 25 degrees and immediately thought about the flap load relief feature.  We taxied to the gate uneventfully.  After reading more about the system on the next leg which was the go home leg and reviewing the CEFA recreation, I assume the flaps went back to 25 degrees for load relief and didn't go back down to 30 degrees.  It had been a busy approach and with gusty winds we incorrectly confirmed the flap gauge setting at the time of the GPWS annunciations which led us to land with the incorrect flap settings.  At groundspeed 0 I can definitely say we should have went around and corrected the situation.  If the GWPS is squawking at you something isn't right and 200-300 ft from the ground isn't the time to troubleshoot the situation.My recommendation would be to execute a Go-Around at a GPWS warning below 1000 feet and troubleshoot the issue at a less critical phase of flight.  For me there was definitely somewhat of a snowball effect.  While on vectors for the RNAV arrival approach the Pilot Flying kept 're-cuising' every time we got a new level off descent even though we were already in VNAV PATH with the brackets.  Doing this we eventually lost VNAV PATH right before we were intercepting the final on the approach.  In his defense we were vectored in very tight to the FAF.  So, at 2000 feet with the autopilot on the Pilot Flying was in the box trying to get VNAV PATH.  I suggested that he take over visual, pointing out we were on the PAPIs and needed to start the descent.  I was able 're cruise' the aircraft for him and re-engaged VNAV to get LNAV/VNAV path before 1000 feet.  We were good to go right at 2000 feet before we started down.  Stable at 1000 feet then we get the large speed increase and I am worried about the overspeed but the speed was corrected in a timely fashion and we were stable at 500 feet.  By the time the GPWS alerts came my situational awareness even as pilot monitoring had diminished some and I think confirmation bias led to incorrectly confirming the flap settings.  The handle is something big and easy to look at when thinking about the flap setting but what really matters is the little flap indication gauge.  The best way to mitigate this would be either call a go-around earlier when things start building up or definitely be more go-around oriented when receiving a GPWS warning low tothe ground.		I was PF ZZZZZ arrival to a RNAV Z (GPS) app. The wx was 270 10 G 34 with mostly clear vis and night time. We had checked the landing data and completed all checklists. The flaps were 30 degs for landing and had been checked. The aircraft experienced a gust around 1000 feet and as the wind slowed the power came up on the engs. We then received another gust and the airspeed increased close to 175 which caused the Load Relief system to blow the flaps up to 25 degs. Around 7-800 feet we received a Too Low Flaps system auto callout. I told the FO to check the handle and we had 30 flaps as i checked as well. I assumed as we slowed below 171 the flaps would push back to 30 degs. As the airspace was saturated and we were stable, on speed, on target at 500 feet, I elected to continue to a full stop in lieu of a go-around which I considered more risky considering the weather and traffic conditions at the time. The landing was normal and we were stopped and got off at taxiway 1, as we briefed. I did not realize the flaps had not returned to 30 until the FOQA gatekeeper called me the next day. I assumed they had returned to 30 when we slowed below 171 as that is how the system works. At the suggestion of the FOQA gatekeeper, I filled out this report.We didn't check the flap gage only the flap handle and assumed the flaps were at 30 due to the handle being at 30. Had i known the flaps didn't push back to 30 from 25, after the Load Relief system engaged, I would have elected to go-around to check the flaps on a second approach.		B737-800 flight crew reported an airspeed increase due to a turbulence encounter on final, caused a flap disagreement resulted in a GPWS alert and failure to go-around.

Takeoff was normal and after turning towards NUGGS we flew into wake turbulence from the departing 757 and we experienced a rapid airspeed loss of approximately 10-30 KIAS and continuous un-commanded left and right AOB of less than 30 degrees. I (PF) called 'upset, push roll thrust stabilize.' Immediately after pushing the thrust levers up, airspeed increased approximately 30 KIAS and the AOB lessened. I did not notice any significant pitch excursions during the entire event. The PM confirmed that we had stabilized and asked ATC for a vector to get away from the wake turbulence which they gave us immediately. We ensured all auto flight modes were reengaged and the rest of the climbout was completed without incidence. A thorough debriefed was concluded and we continued the flight.	Reporter stated the onset of the wake turbulence was unexpectedly strong.			B737NG Captain reported encountering wake turbulence departing DEN in trail of a B757 that resulted in an upset. Control was reestablished and flight continued normally.

New CA training in left seat, Line Check Pilot (LCP) in right seat, F40 landing (lots of discussion about not forgetting to go to F40), close in traffic with TCAS TAs, multiple close in step downs from ATC resulting in constant manipulation of Mode Control Panel (MCP), long duty day, long trip with 4 reassignments, cumulative sleep deficit (numerous discussions by both pilots about how exhausted and 'brain fried' we were), shorter than planned and expected layovers due to delays and reassignments.At about 700' on visual approach to XXR, tower issued a low altitude alert for our flight.  We both noticed that we were below our path, Trainee in left seat immediately turned off automation and adjusted flight path.  We selected appropriate modes and completed the flight with a safe and successful approach and landing.During the thorough debrief, we found the reason that we ended up in that situation was the failure to remain in VNAV which was due to multiple close in step downs, leaving us high, and the subsequent failure of the PM to effectively monitor the FMA due to task saturation.  Both pilots were affected by multiple long duty days with short layovers, delays, reassignments, poor sleep, and failed to acknowledge the cumulative fatigue and should have not operated.		It had been a long 4 day trip with multiple reassignments and long days. We had an early 1.5 hour deadhead followed by a 3 hour sit, then the 5 hour 7 minute flight ZZZ1 to ZZZ. For the majority of the flight we had trained and discussed topics since it was IOE which was very beneficial and occasionally dealt with turbulence. We both had acknowledged our fatigue enroute from the long trip and multiple changes. However, we thoroughly briefed the entire approach, arrival and all threats. We were on the visual approach XXR, it was dusk, there was a 757 off our left to maintain visual separation, a strong right crosswind and multiple altitude changes from ATC. We were on the approach and forgot to arm VNAV and got a low altitude alert from ZZZ tower. We kicked off automation and hand flew, reengaged VNAV and successfully landed.		Air carrier flight crew reported descended below the published minimums during approach resulting in a low altitude alert from ATC. Flight crew corrected and continued to landing.

A few moments later, tower issued a heading for a base turn close to abeam the final approach fix. We turned to line up for final approach close in to the FAF (Final Approach Fix) while configuring the aircraft for landing. As we passed the FAF I called for flaps 30, the landing configuration, not realizing that we were descending below 1000'.A more thorough approach briefing, referencing the notes in the company pages could have been conducted. Fatigue was also a factor. With our early start, our situational awareness was not at its peak.it also seems that the tower at ZZZ vectors aircraft in for very short approaches, not giving sufficient time to bleed energy and configure. Controllers could extend downwind sufficiently to configure.		The flight was uneventful until we joined the downwind leg for Runway XXL. With the airport positioned at our 3 o'clock, ZZZ Approach cleared us for a visual approach to Runway XXL. The PF (Pilot Flying) immediately disconnected the automation and initiated an early base turn, resulting in a tight approach given our speed, altitude, and position relative to the touchdown zone. This maneuver had neither been briefed nor discussed.I observed that the PF appeared to be managing a high workload and was not effectively communicating his plan for the approach. This led me to focus on closely monitoring speed and energy management to ensure the aircraft remained within safe parameters. Consequently, I missed the late final configuration, which was completed at approximately 700 feet AGL.Task saturation, poor communication, and inappropriate use of available resources (automation) were contributing factors in this event.I should have been more assertive and not allowed external factors--such as the PF's extensive flying experience--to influence my judgment when identifying and addressing threats and errors.		Air carrier flight crew reported while flying a visual approach they turned base early resulting in an unstabilized approach and late aircraft configuration.

Takeoff normal, and on climbout at 1200' AGL I clearly saw a turkey vulture out the left window. A second later we heard what we thought we recognized as a bird strike (a hard knock) on the fuselage. I instinctively looked at the engine instruments and noticed no change from normal. About 5-10 seconds later the First Officer (FO) and I smelled a 'burnt hair' smell and seconds later were notified by FA's they smelled 'something burning' both of which indicated to us that the bird was ingested down the engine. We advised ATC of the bird strike, our intent to return to ZZZ, cleaned/leveled the aircraft at 3000', and accepted vectors for ILS Runway XX. [Priority handling was requested], Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) requested, flight attendants (FA's), company (ACARS), and passengers notified. We ran the Overweight Landing checklist, briefed threats and the approach with the intent to clear the runway if able. Per the Overweight Landing checklist we configured flaps 30 with autobrakes MAX. Landing was normal, cleared the runway and stopped the aircraft on Taxiway 1. We wer met by ARFF and we asked them to look over the aircraft, #1 engine, and brakes. Based upon the 175K pound landing and concern for overheating brakes we elected to coordinate for a tug into the gate. We shut down engines, tugged into the gate, then made aware of damage to the engine. Of note, there was no indication of engine damage or irregularity during flight which is why, although we suspected an ingested bird, I decided to keep the #1 engine running. The engine indicated and operated normally all of the way until shutdown.				B737 pilot reported on departure experiencing a bird strike resulting in returning to the departure airport and being towed back to the gate.

We leveled at 10,00 feet and followed the Electronic checklist.  It led us to shut down the left engine.  We [requested priority handling], requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting), and began a return to ZZZ.  After the engine was secure, I had the F/O fly and handle the radios. I had my relief pilot backing me up on checklists and calling the company to tell them we were returning.  I advised dispatch, the flight attendants, and passengers.  We went through the Overweight landing checklist and Non-routine landing checklists. We did the landing performance assessment and agreed we had plenty of runway in ZZZ for the return.  We all discussed threats and go-around procedures. I reviewed the ILS XXC approach. We did the descent checklist.  We all agreed we had done everything we could think of to prepare for a single engine landing.  We got clearance for the ILS, and I flew as normal an approach as possible with the autopilot on until 250 feet.  Touchdown was at 500,000 lbs. around 100 ft. Per minute descent rate. We stopped on the runway.  I made an announcement to have everyone remain seated while safety vehicles checked out the aircraft.  We had ARFF check the left engine for smoke or signs of fire. Also, had them look at the brakes, which they reported were at 300 degrees.  We felt that was sufficiently cool enough to taxi normally to a gate.  We taxied to the gate and shut down. Perhaps Maintenance could have taken the time to look at why there were L Eng. Fire Detector Loop 1 and L. Eng. Overheat Detector Loop 1 status messages.		We had an uneventful preflight from my perspective. MX (Maintenance) had to accomplish an MEL associated with one of the left engine overheat warning loops. The required procedure was accomplished (put inop stickers in the cockpit) and we pushed on time.  Taxi / takeoff was normal. At around 9000 feet on climb out approximately 8 minutes after takeoff, we got an EICAS Msg - Engine Overheat Left. We leveled off, accomplished the abnormal checklist and shut the left engine down. Textbook, just like we walk through in the sim. FO started flying while CA coordinated and communicated our intentions to the company, dispatch, the FAs and the passengers. We accomplished all the appropriate checklists, landed overweight and stopped straight ahead. The fire trucks checked out our engine for any anomalies and brakes for excessive heat and we determined with their input that we should single engine taxi to our gate.What caused the problem is the EICAS alerted us to a possible engine overheat.		B777-200 flight crew reported an EICAS engine overheat message that maintenance deferred resulted in engine shutdown and return to departure airport.

The decision of the visual approach was supported by the reported weather at ZZZ. On arrival into ZZZ we were told by approach control to expect the Ils XX, and I read that back. A short time later the first officer stated he had the field in sight, and we did in fact both have the field in sight, but I didn't communicate this to atc at that time. After being cleared for the approach we were approaching ZZZZZ while following the ils approach the first officer, assuming we were cleared for the visual approach, stated he was going to cut the corner and then turned to a heading toward ZZZZZ1 and selected open descent to 7000. This was helping to stay further away from the restricted area just beyond ZZZZZ. There was some discussion between the first officer and I at this time of whether we were cleared for the visual or the ils, and I couldn't remember which one we had actually been cleared for, but the first officer was under the understanding we were cleared for the visual, so we continued on the current path. At the point where we reached 7000 atc contacted us and informed us we were under minimum vectoring altitude and instructed us to climb to 8000 and gave us a slightly different heading which we complied with. Atc then cleared us for the ils approach runway XX in which I read back and we complied. At no point during the course of course of these events did we have any gpws warnings or any other aircraft warnings.  Some of the factors which contributed to this event were an unclear communication between the first officer and I, unclear communication between atc and myself, and the new arrival procedures which had just been implemented about a week prior.  The crew communication being unclear was partially due to the busy environment and trying to accomplish all of our duties at the same time. I should have communicated the field in sight when we had it, and also clarify whether we were cleared for the visual approach or ils with atc even though we were both very busy with him managing flying the aircraft, and me managing the monitoring of everything. We spent a good amount of time prior to entering approach environment in briefing the new procedures, and were clear on how they should be flown and set up for, but were still unsure of how we were going to be controlled by atc through them.		I was Pilot Flying on approach into ZZZ utilizing ILS XX which I briefed as a visual, backed up with the ILS XX approach. I take full ownership of my actions and accountability as the Pilot Flying that performed these actions.  To help characterize the events that occurred, this is my perspective to the best of my recollection.After descending on the ZZZZZ arrival with assigned altitudes, my understanding was that we were then cleared for a visual approach to ZZZ runway XX, as I had talked with the Pilot Monitoring about the airport being in sight a few minutes prior, and ceilings supported a visual approach.In addition to this understanding that we were cleared for the visual, and knowing that the new ZZZZZ arrival brings us very close to the Restricted Area and it's associated military activity and terrain, I looked to my right to verify that the airport and surrounding terrain was still in sight, then asked the Pilot Monitoring 'are you ok with a right turn - I believe we were cleared for the visual?' There was a little hesitation/confusion but he seemed to agree so I selected a heading towards a final approach as well as a safe altitude to head that direction. (utilizing an Open Descent to 7000' MSL, heading approximately toward ZZZZZ1). Increasing the safety of flight was my motivation for doing this, thinking that it gave us more distance from the Restricted Area and its associated military activity, the terrain within it and turbulence created by the terrain in North wind, as well as the small but increasingly utilized ZZZ1 airport. We then briefly discussed the question of being cleared for the visual but were interrupted by other duties associated with flying the airplane (callouts for configuring if I remember correctly).  During that time, ATC notified us that we were below the minimum vectoring altitude, and assigned us a new altitude and heading which I immediately complied with. The rest of the approach was flown uneventfully. At no time were any terrain alert features of the aircraft activated or triggered, nor was safety of flight affected from my perspective.Causal Factors & Lessons Learned:1) Miscommunication - I should have been more clear in my communication at several points -A) When reporting that I had the field in sight to the Pilot MonitoringB) When listening for our approach clearanceC)When asking if we had been cleared for the visual prior to changing course. I also should have requested & waited for confirmation that we were cleared for the visual before changing course, as I have done many times before.2)New Arrival - I believe the ZZZZZ has been published for about two weeks. I flew it only once before, and remember being uncomfortably close to the restricted area…3)Proximity to the Restricted Area & ZZZ1 airport - Although I know and respect that when under an IFR flight plan, we should be protected from Restricted Area incursions by ATC as well as NOTAM review, it is always possible to be given a visual at any point near there, at which point I prefer to have more distance from the restricted area and ZZZ1 airport, as well as from the terrain and rotor turbulence caused by it with winds out of the north.  If ZZZZZ1 were not located so close to it, I wouldn't have felt the need to vary course away from it.  Better NOTAM review on my part, as well as having a note in the ZZZ ATIS regarding the status of R-XXXX as does ZZZ2 ATIS could also help with local situational awareness for inbound aircraft.4)Approach confusion due to winds - I briefed the assigned ZZZZZ arrival and associated weather with contradictory North winds, which could dictate that we change to the RNAV Visual XY if winds exceeded 10 knots, which would require a different arrival as well since there is no Via for it from the ZZZZZ1. Crossing ZZZZZ1 with the assigned altitude of 9000' instead of the 11,000 on the plate, it momentarily seemed like we might have been getting a rerouting.  This did not end up happening, but some of the mental questioning that I did during that time may have distracted me from hearing which approach we ended up being cleared for.  This would have been easily avoided with more clear communication on my part with the Pilot Monitoring as well as ATC. Additionally, better arrival and approach options for both runways would help simplify the briefing and flying into ZZZ2. (I do however appreciate the time and effort that it took to get the procedures that we currently have.)5) Fatigue -  My Reserve duty period began at XA:30, and I was called at approximately XB:00 for the XD:00 showtime during the primary Window of Circadian Low.  We were then delayed due to maintenance.  After this, and at the end of the last flight of the day, The approach then occurred near the afternoon trough in circadian rhythm after nearly 12 hours of duty time.  I felt alert and competent throughout the flight, mitigating any effects with hydration and light caffeine intake, but I believe the effects of this timing on the body is well known and worth mentioning.  It could also be partly mitigated with Crew Support notifying pilots closer to the minimum XX minute required callout instead of 2-4 hours in advance as happened here and previously, where they wake you up 30-120 minutes earlier than necessary.In conclusion, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective and factors that led to this, and have learned how important seemingly small details in communication are in such a high stakes environment.  I would like to reiterate that I take full responsibility and ownership of my actions and I hope to carry these lessons forward in my flying career. I'm happy to help clarify or answer any questions regarding this, I'm eager to learn and improve, and hope to hear any feedback, suggestions or improvements I can make in my flying.		Air carrier pilots reported they were advised by ATC that their aircraft was below the minimum vectoring altitude.

The FO and I (CA) received an amber alert message for the ENG 2 Hydraulic Pump, at this time, I stated 'My Aircraft' followed by identifying the caution message that was received. Confirming that the aircraft control was safely under control, the FO punctually referenced the associated QRH procedure for 'Hydraulic Pump Low Pressure.' The QRH procedure required for the associated HYD Pump Switch (ENG 2) to be placed in the 'OFF' position with no further action. Understanding the notes section for this particular checklist, we were aware that it may be possible to intermittently experience an illumination of the LOW PRESSURE light for the remaining associated electric motor-driven hydraulic pump - for this note, the FO recommended we leave the hydraulic synopsis page displayed so that we can actively monitor and verify that we had consistent, positive hydraulic pressure for the B system. I believed that was a great idea, and we did just that. An initial eAML entry was made for this issue. Continuing along at FL320 sometime between 2 and 2.5hrs into the flight, near the ZZZZZ waypoint, we would then receive an amber master caution and recall message, this time for System B ELEC 1. 'My Aircraft' was then stated by myself as the PF, and we acknowledged the message, understanding that this was already made aware to us as a possibility referencing the Hydraulic Pump Low Pressure QRH. We would moments later notice that our System B hydraulic pressure and quantity indicated on the synopsis page would begin to rapidly drop to zero. At this time, once the pressure neared zero, the aircraft's Yaw Damper disengaged. We were just approaching the Location X at FL320 and with reports of mountain wave activity being in the area, while we were not experiencing the mountain waves, it was a high possibility that controlling the aircraft could become seemingly more difficult. I (the PF) continued to fly the aircraft with the autopilot (CMD A) on. Initially the ride at FL320 was not rough in any degree, though right before we began to reference the QRH procedure for 'Loss of System B,' we began to experience light turbulence which then made controlling the aircraft in a smooth, manner more difficult as the yawing motions began to increase. Doing our best to counteract the yawing motion, the turbulence began to worsen over the mountains, we knew by referencing the FMS Plus application along with reports in our area, that the winds and rides at the lower flight levels were much better, which is when I asked the FO to request a descent to FL280 with ATC. We were granted this request. At FL320, the conditions began to worsen regarding the rides, which ultimately disengaged the A/P, FL280 was confirmed on the MCP and an initial descent at a smooth rate was attempted. This was done by opening our speed window, selecting .75, and the FO inputting a -700 FPM decent rate via vertical speed. Understanding that maintaining the aircraft's speed was not an issue, the primary focus was to operate the aircraft as safely as possible so that the flight path conditions would not worsen, thinking about our FA's and passengers in the cabin. The descent was then initiated, and the yawing motions began to increase with the turbulence we received, the autopilot kicked off as a result following a call from the #1 FA inquiring about the rides. Task saturation began to increase regarding maintaining safe and positive control of the aircraft, 'My Aircraft' was again stated by myself, and I asked the FO to inform the FA's to take their seats and that we will get back to them in a timely manner. That was done, and with the seatbelt sign on, the passengers all took their seats and the FA's began to occupy their respective jumpseats for their safety. The FO then brings his focus back to the situation that we were experiencing after speaking with the #1 FA and immediately began aiding me in monitoring our descent rate along with the volatile yawing motion. It seemed that we were able to maintain a steady descent rate and after 18 seconds of hand flying, I reengaged A/P CMD A to help reduce our workload. 11 seconds later as the yawing motions began to increase again, the A/P was then kicked off again. Reverting back to hand flying, positive aircraft control remained established, 23 seconds later, the autopilot was then reengaged, this time with a command input to descent at -500 FPM, then the autopilot shortly after disengaged once more. By this point I began to smoothly lower the aircraft's pitch to descend at a faster rate to get out of the turbulence at initially -2550 FPM at FL315 then by FL306, the turbulence smoothed out well and the descent rate was transitioned to -500 FPM at FL300 which the A/P reengaged, for its final time. We then continued a stable descent to FL280, and once we leveled off at FL280, maintaining 280kts (.75) a transfer of the flight controls and radios was made to the FO so that I could speak to the FA's, bring them in the loop as to what was going on and to ensure that they were safe. The FO said, 'My Aircraft' and my conversation with the FA's were made. They were fully safe, acknowledged that they were in their seats, and I informed them that I will call them back once we ran the QRH that was required and to fill them in on a plan that Dispatch, the FO and I developed. Once I brought my attention back to the Flightdeck, the FO did a great job with maintaining safe and positive control of the aircraft as well as informing me that no changes were had. Now that the plane was fully stable at FL280 and we knew that the FA's were safe, we then ran the QRH procedure of Loss of System B. This QRH after following the correct steps in order, we concluded that a flaps 15 landing via alternate flap extension would be required. Though the aircraft was in a stable position and the QRH procedure did not recommend a diversion, I wanted to fill the dispatcher in on the situation to get his input as well. The FO maintained positive control of the aircraft, and using the Crew Central Application, I made a phone call to Dispatch Desk XX. Speaking to the dispatcher and filling him in on our situation, we discussed options of a precautionary diversion but ultimately figured that given our aircraft was able to be safely operated, diverting to ZZZ1 (We were roughly 250 nm NE of the airport) would have not be a good option as the winds were thoroughly gusty there, and landing the aircraft with an inoperative yaw damper in gusty conditions could introduce new threat potentials that neither the FO or I were willing to make. This conclusion was also the same for both ZZZ2 and ZZZ3 as well and we were all in agreement with this idea. The next topic the dispatcher and I discussed was fuel. Knowing that continuing our flight to ZZZ4 at FL280 where the rides would remain smooth and that the weather reported at ZZZ4 was VFR with winds less than 10 knots, landing in ZZZ4 with 6.9 LBS of fuel would still give us the option of being able to divert to ZZZ5 or ZZZ6 if for some reason we could not land at ZZZ4. Now the decision to continue to ZZZ4 was agreed upon, the Dispatcher and I further concluded that [requesting priority handling] was appropriate so that we could 1) Receive priority to ZZZ4, reducing the chances of any sort of route vectors that could compromise our arrival fuel and 2) Given that we would be executing a partial flap landing associated with this hydraulic malfunction. The [priority handling was requested], the nature of our issue, fuel and souls on board were given to ATC, the FA's were made aware of the plan that the Dispatcher, the FO and I came up with. The FA's were then briefed following the guidance of the Non-Routine Landing Considerations Checklist. Once this was all completed, the FO and I then noticed that we had an 'Oil Filter Bypass' message illuminated for ENG 2. This then caused us to reference the associated QRH procedure for this message. Following the guidance of the QRH, the A/T were disconnected, thrust lever 2 was confirmed and then slowly idled. The Oil Filter Bypass amber message remained illuminated which then led us to the completion of the Engine Oil Filter Bypass QRH and to proceed to the 'Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist.' Understanding that single engine operations for imminent and the workload between the crew and I will be further increased, the FO and I both were fully aware that we needed to ensure we handle this situation in every way that we've training for, in alignment with SOP's. Prior to these events happening, the FO and I ate our crew meals and now being more than halfway through our flight, the FO expressed his urgency for needing to use the lavatory. Understanding the complexities of our situation and the workload to follow, the exchange of flight controls back to myself was made and the FO made a call to the #1 to set up a keep lavatory break for just himself. I much rather preferred the FO to take care of himself in this manner, so when it came down to doing all the tasks associated with this developed [priority handling], the FO would have more opportunities of remaining in the 'Green' than if he didn't use the restroom. This also served as a great opportunity to brief the #1 FA once he replaced the FO in the flight deck. Once the #1 FA entered the flight deck, I informed him of our further developed issue, and once again briefed him in accordance with Non-Routine Landing Considerations Checklist and not the briefing. Once the FO returned to the flightdeck, ATC was updated on our new [priority handling] of having to shut down our ENG 2, we needed to descend below at least FL210 and that we will get back to ATC with a plan. We were cleared to I believe FL200 and that descent was initiated so that when we shut down our ENG 2, we'd be at a safe altitude to operate. The FO ultimately regained positive control of the aircraft by acknowledging 'My Aircraft,' and the QRH procedure for 'Engine Failure or Shutdown' was accomplished, concluding that a restart will not be accomplished. Once the aircraft was stable, we needed to formulate a new plan in determining what the nearest suitable alternate would be. Knowing the resources that our Dispatchers have access to with their ability of being such huge assistance to us from the Dispatch, the FO continued to maintain control of the aircraft and now the radios as I attempted to contact via the Crew Central application. Unfortunately to phone call to dispatch desk XX was unable to go through a few attempts, I brought my focus back to the FO to ensure that plane was still operating well and updates from ATC. After it was indicative that we were both in the green, we began to look for a suitable diversion ourselves. Discovered that ZZZ weather was the best, VFR, stable winds below 10 knots, two 12,000ft runways, and we made the decision to go there. A message to dispatch was then sent via ACARs informing them of our developed situation being single engine because of the Oil Filter Bypass and that we were going to ZZZ. Dispatch replied with, 'copy' and began to do their best with coordinating our diversion, providing us with the appropriate updated arrival weather, informing the ZZZ station etc. Continuing now with our One Engine Inoperative Checklist, using the B737 Land App, the required landing distance numbers were run for both the Loss of System B and for One Engine Inoperative. Loss of System B required a landing distance of 6,796ft for 'Dry' conditions, the One Engine Inoperative data required a landing distance of 5,900 ft, we chose the conservative approach, by using the Loss of System B required landing distance as governing. The FO crossed checked my work and our numbers both matched. The FO continued to fly the aircraft as I (CA) did FMC box work, loading up our approach,		During flight we encountered several mechanical issues resulting in a diversion to ZZZ. The first happened during the climb around FL240. We got a caution light for ENG 2 hydraulic pump low pressure. We went through the QRH and it had us turn off the associated pump switch. We had also opened the system hydraulic page to to confirm that we still had system pressure and adequate fluid. Those indications still appeared normal. The captained entered the write up in the AML and we continued.Around 2.5 hours into the flight we received another master caution. This time it was showing both electric and engine pumps for SYS B. We then saw the hydraulic quantity rapidly deplete to zero. A few moments later the yaw damper disengaged with the loss of SYS B. We began a descent to lower altitude with smoother rides with potential mountain wave predicted ahead at higher altitudes. In the descent we did pick up some turbulence and the captain had turned off the autopilot and had to attempt to reengage it a couple of times during descent while I coordinated with ATC and pulled up the QRH. Once level the I took the controls and we went through the QRH. The Captain also informed the flight attendants and called dispatch to coordinate with them. Between all of us we opted to continue for ZZZ4 because the airports around were high elevation with gusty winds and the QRH did no recommend landing at the nearest suitable airport. We informed ATC of the issue and [requested priority handling] to assist with priority handling.Not long after completing those things we realized the Oil Filter Bypass caution was illuminated. We ran the QRH for that procedure, which had us pull the thrust lever back to see if the message would extinguish and it did not. Then it led us to shutdown the engine. After that was done we informed ATC of the new issue and we decided to divert to ZZZ. The weather was pretty calm there and it was around 200 miles ahead of us. On the way in we prepared and discussed factors such as terrain, single engine missed approach, as well as comparing both system failure landing data. The HYD SYS failure resulted in a longer distance required so we used that. The runway at ZZZ provided more than enough distance. Once we landed we had [priority handling] vehicles check us out and they confirmed the right engine was leaking fluid on the runway. We discussed that we believe it is just hydraulic fluid and once the [priority handling] vehicles gave us the OK, we continued to the gate. Once at the gate we shut down the aircraft, completed the write ups and filled in local station and maintenance personnel that came to the flight deck.Cause: A couple of mechanical failures. Everybody we worked with was professional and gave us the support we needed. While there is always room for improvement from us as you look back, our training and professionalism allowed us to work together, run the procedures, and use our resources to get the passengers safely to the ground.		B737-800 flight crew reported loss of hydraulic pressure and malfunctioning yaw damper. After an oil bypass valve failure indication the flight diverted to a nearby airport.

We were following a 777 and spacing was tight. We even tried to slow a little early at FAF to help. Heavy in front of us did not clear runway until inside 300 FT AGL. Winds were calm and encountered significant wake turbulence inside 100 FT AGL. Did want to risk the stability of the landing and elected to go around. Uneventful go around. Advised ATC and communicated to FAs and customers. Fuel was fine. Reloaded the box and reran checklists and flew another stable approach to an uneventful landing. For data purposes, EWR continues to struggle with ATC spacing. And to add fun to the second approach, had a stuck Tower mic for over 5 minutes (thankfully after we were cleared to land a second time).		On approach at EWR on ILS 22L we were assigned 180 BUZZD and close behind a 777. CA was PF and I was PM, and we saw we were close, so he started slowing to increase our separation. Fully configured, briefed, stable, cleared to land. ATC was training (we heard multiple voices while on final approach XXX.XX). Aircraft in front of us was still on the runway as we were passing 300', but they exited and we felt a shift to the left and a balloon resulting in 3 white and 1 red. Wake turbulence from the lack of separation resulted in CA initiating a go-around. I PM'd the go-around which was executed per SOP. Came back around and successfully landed, unfortunately after we were cleared the runway there was a stuck mic on Tower for our final approach and taxi before switching to Ground. The lack of separation resulted in our wake turbulence, so our go-around was imminent and resulted in a safe landing.		B737 NG flight crew reported executing a go-around at EWR after encountering wake turbulence from a preceding B777 below 100 feet on final approach.

First Officer (FO) ( pilot monitoring (PM) ) acknowledged ECAM and applied QRH procedures for this non-normal and the fault was cleared. After a few minutes we received the same ECAM - NAV LS TUNING DISAGREE followed by Autopilot, Auto throttles and Flight Director (FD) 1&2 disconnected. Also MAP DISPLAY NOT AVAILABLE and GPS PRIMARY LOST message on Navigation display ( ND ). I ( Captain ) continued to fly and called for ECAM actions. FO ran ECAM and proceeded to QRH. We advised ATC and requested radar vectors and headings to avoid weather North of our flight path. When QRH was completed we made the decision to return to ZZZ and [requested priority handling]. Control was then transferred from Captain to FO. We assessed our non normal. I ( Captain ) contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control via SATCOM. Maintenance asked if we performed QRH for dual FMGC failure. I advised we had but I would do it again. After reviewing QRH with no success we made the decision to use Raw Data as primary navigation aid and made ATC aware of the aircraft malfunctions. I then briefed the flight attendants. PA was made for the passengers about our intention to return to ZZZ due to aircraft maintenance issues. We calculated approach speed using QRH and flight manual and completed our checklist. Requested radar vectors from ATC for a visual approach and the landing was uneventful. When clear of the runway advised flight attendants to remain seated and taxied to the gate. Passengers deplaned and made logbook entries. END.				A320 Captain reported failure of multiple navigation systems during climb resulted in the flight crew using raw data.

The flight route had us flying predominantly overwater to ZZZ1. While abeam the coast approximately 100 miles from the coastline, we entered a cloud layer with the outside air temp about -25 deg C. We immediately applied engine anti-ice heat to both engines. After several minutes at 280 kts. and getting bumped around quite a bit, I heard a very distinct change in outside noise that perpetuated. At first, I thought we ingested a bird into one of the engines and that was causing one of the engines to run rough, but the noise continued and began to get louder as now the sound was coming from both engines. I looked down at the secondary instrument display and noticed both engine vibe indicators were increasing. When I first glanced down, they were both in the mid 3s and steadily climbing. Correspondingly, engine oil temps were about 115 deg C and slowly climbing, engine oil pressure looked normal. I reached up to again verify that both engine anti-ice switches were on and they were, confirmed by the Thermal Anti-Ice (TAI) indication above both N1 gauges. I looked out the windscreen and noticed ice building up around the edges of the windscreen. This all happened very quickly and suddenly, as if we had just flown into a wall of wet sleet and slush, none of which showed up on our weather radar, which both of us had up on our nav display. I quickly came to the conclusion that we were in severe icing and it was affecting both engines. At this point I turned on wing anti-ice as well. I had been communicating with the First Officer (FO) all of this and asked him to run the Engine High Vibration QRH checklist. We followed all of the steps in the checklist to include autothrottle off and realized that we needed to descend immediately to both reduce the loads on the engines and get out of the severe icing condition. After a quick consultation about how to proceed, the FO [advised ATC], and requested a lower altitude (in hindsight, I wished we would have made a MAYDAY call here and notified ATC of our intention to descend, but in the heat of the moment you go with what you think is best at the time). As we were waiting for the descent clearance, the left engine was above 5.0 on the vibe indicator, with reverse video on, and the right engine was at 4.9. ATC took more time than I liked to give us a descent clearance so I told the FO to [request priority handling] and tell them we need to descend immediately (again, we should have cleared ourselves with TCAS and descended, but in the moment that seemed like the best thing to do). Within a few seconds of that 2d call, ATC gave us a descent clearance and told us he can clear us to as low as we needed. During that 2d call to ATC the FO also requested direct ZZZ3 and the controller gave us a heading of 320. As we were descending, he cleared us down to 10,000 ft. During the descent I thought about going to ZZZ4 instead of ZZZ3 because it was closer but the amount of snow, ice, and sleet we were in ruled that out as we needed to exit icing conditions. We settled on heading to ZZZ3 as it was about 120 miles and better weather than ZZZ4. When we initiated the descent, I reduced power on both engines below 45% N1 as directed by the QRH and immediately the vibes decreased to the low 3s on the #1 engine and high 2s on the #2 engine. I was concerned for a dual engine flameout over water so I kept the power as close to 45% as I could.We continued our descent to 10,000 and headed to ZZZ3. The FO got the weather in ZZZ3 and it looked good enough - with light snow and overcast ceilings around 1200 ft. We continued our descent to min vectoring altitude which was 3400 ft, to get us to the warmest air possible. As we descended to warmer air, both engine vibe indications were getting lower and oil temps were coming down. Feeling better about the aircraft state, I passed the controls to the FO and began briefing dispatch, the flight attendants, and the passengers. During this time, Dispatch sent us an ACARS note saying that ZZZ was a better option than ZZZ3. With both engines recovered from the severe icing and the aircraft flying and responding well, we agreed to continue the flight to ZZZ. I re-briefed the flight attendants and passengers and informed Dispatch we were headed to ZZZ after we received a clearance from ATC. Initially, when we were headed to ZZZ3 with the engines and airplane in a precarious situation, I told ATC we would need Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) at ZZZ3. As we were headed to ZZZ, with the aircraft in a stable state, I told ATC we did not need ARFF services at ZZZ but they were still deployed along our runway when we landed there uneventfully, under max landing weight. Had we landed at ZZZ3 it would have been an overweight landing, but the additional flying to ZZZ brought us just under max landing weight.After arriving at the gate, I called Maintenance Control, made a logbook entry, spoke with ZZZ Maintenance, and spoke with the chief pilot. Before I had the chance to get out of my seat, the flight attendants were gone. I never had the chance to debrief with them. Upon entering the terminal, I realized that they had already started boarding our passengers on a new aircraft to ZZZ1. That meant that our flight attendants were already working their next flight. This upset me very much. Someone in the flight attendant's management chain had made the decision that boarding the continuation flight to ZZZ1 was more important than giving me the opportunity to debrief with my crew. Totally unacceptable. The human factors of what we went through should have been allowed to come to closure instead of pretending that we were ok to continue working the follow-on flight without a thorough debrief of our actions and events. During all of these events, the FO was outstanding, very proactive, and super proficient in all of his duties.Cause: Super cooled liquid droplets that were not depicted on weather radar, and the fact that the cabin was getting warm at the gate in ZZZ2 because the pack that cools the main cabin was inop. I was trying to get off the gate quickly to minimize passenger discomfort. Had we taken more time to analyze all of the data in WSI showing where the icing was at FL250, we may not have departed, or changed our route with more added gas. If a flight is restricted to FL250, both the Dispatcher and flight crew should study the route more to avoid flying into forecasted severe icing. I don't know if severe icing was forecast in the area we were flying to before the flight. I did look at weather prior to departing, to include weather radar and turbulence areas, but I did not dig into the icing charts. The radar depiction was green on the WSI radar depiction for our flight path.		While working flight XXXX ZZZ2-ZZZ1, we were dealing with a PACK Mel that limited us to 25000 ft. While enroute, and off the coast abeam ZZZ4, we felt and then noticed the engine vibrations go above 4 and into the 5s. We were in IMC and in icing conditions at the time, and the cowl anti-ice were on. The Captain, who was pilot flying (PF), directed me to get a lower altitude and run the QRH for Engine Vibes. I notified Center, and they gave us 15000 ft. Following the QRH, it directed the PF to reduce the power to less than 45%, which did get rid of the vibe indication. We sent a 7700 on ACARs, and assessed the weather of the nearest diversion airports. ZZZ4 had okay visibility, but the winds were more significant than ZZZ3 that did have snow and less vis, but it was still above mins and lighter winds. We decided to go to ZZZ3, officially [requested priority handling], and asked for Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to standby. We ended up descending to 5000 ft., and by that time all engine indications stabilized. We had plenty of gas, and were planning on an overweight landing as well. Dispatch sent us an ACARs suggesting ZZZ, and we decided to do that since now that everything was stabilized and the weather was pretty much CAVOK.Captain did a good job of communicating with the flight attendants (FAs), and we did send multiple ACARs msgs to Dispatch, but our ACARs were going in and out. ATC asked if we still needed ARFF, we told them no, but they still were rolled. The Captain landed on XXC, we taxied to the gate, and had no further issues. Maintenance met us, and proper logbook entries were made. Having an MEL that limited us at FL250 where the highest likely hood of severe icing existed. Many other times with this MEL, I always have automatically associated it with convective weather systems, but that will be in mind as well. Also, though I found it quickly once I used search, I highly suggest the Vibrations QRH be just under 'Vibrations' and not 'Engine Vibrations'. It is already under the 'Engines' subsection, and the indicator is Vib, and no other system has an associated 'Vibrations' QRH. Lastly, having the opportunity to debrief as a crew whenever an emergency happens before we all get reassigned would be nice.		Air carrier flight crew reported engine vibrations when entering unexpected icing conditions and diversion to a nearby suitable airport.

We experienced a #1 engine stall, with engine pressure ratio (EPR) rollback, and an ECAM message "#1Engine Stall".The FADEC did an auto relight and the engine recovered after about 2 seconds without pilot action. Both the First Officer (FO) and I perceived a yaw to the left, I noted the igniters were on, and honestly, I was laser focused on EPR and did not observe the rest of the engine parameters.I transferred controls to the First Officer and called Dispatch/Maintenance Control via satellite communications. While talking with Dispatch/Maintenance the #1 engine experienced another engine stall. I told the First Officer to start coordinating with ATC, to get us turned around, and told him under no circumstances do we cross the oceanic boundary. We all agreed to do a return to ZZZ. Dispatch/Operations/Maintenance were advised of our status, and Maintenance Control advised to do an overweight landing.Cabin crew was briefed, I advised cabin crew we were doing an air return, but, it was not an urgent situation, as both engines were still running. Customers were informed of our return, and a return to ZZZ clearance was coordinated with ATC.No emergency was declared.We ran the divert QRH and the OVERWEIGHT LANDING QRHWe complied with all items and procedures in the overweight landing checklist.We experienced 4 or 5 engine stalls in total.We landed, significantly overweight, without delay, as that was the safest course of action.A logbook writeup was done for engine stall inflightA logbook writeup was done for overweight landingThis aircraft had experienced #1 engine stalls on a previous flight. The aircraft was out of service in ZZZ1 for, I believe, a couple days while the engine was worked on. It was ferried to ZZZ2 in the morning, and we flew in from ZZZ2 to ZZZ. So we experienced the engine anomaly on the second revenue leg after the engine work was done for the previous engine stall at altitude.				A320 Captain reported returning to departure airport after experiencing multiple stalls in #1 engine.

The secondary engine indication on the lower display popped up showing the number 1 engine oil quantity at 3. So we went ahead and accomplished the QRH procedure. Which recommends that as long as the oil pressure and temperature are within limits to continue normally. And soon after the qty dropped to 0. As we kept monitoring the situation we [advised ATC] and requested to reroute over land instead over the gulf.  While the Captain is communicating the situation to dispatch. I, (FO,PF) noticed that the oil pressure dropped to the amber line and soon after went back up to about 33psi. and the number 1 engine indication on the primary engine display flashed amber. At this time we decided that it was a better idea to divert to ZZZ2.After talking to company, flight attendants and passengers. We executed an uneventful landing in ZZZ2.I think the procedure in place to blank the lower display after engine start are the best way to mitigate any excedance which make the lower display popped and therefore get the attention from any pilots.				B737-800 flight crew reported during cruise the number 1 engine oil quantity dropped to zero. Flight crew diverted and landed safely.

RNAV arrival into ZZZ we had been in contact with ZZZ Approach while descending through FL240 down to 14000 feet then was given to "Descend Via" the ZZZZZ which the bottom altitude was 4000 ft for Runway XXL. The Pilot Monitoring and myself had been monitoring the weather during the course of the arrival and had noticed that there was a large build up or a large weather cell that was possibly hovering over the last part of the ZZZZZ STAR. I asked the Pilot Monitoring to ask ZZZ Approach control to see if we could receive a heading to the south of the arrival and try to stay clear of the weather going towards the waypoint that ZZZ Approach wanted us to fly towards. The Approach controller had stated to us that he did not see anything on his radar screen weather wise that would put us into the weather during the arrival but did give us a heading to fly and we would then expect radar vectors for the ILS RWY XXL approach. At the time the Approach controller gave us a heading to fly and then gave us a frequency change to contact ZZZ1 Approach. Upon contacting the ZZZ1 Approach controller he then gave us a heading to fly as well that would set the aircraft up for an intercept course into the final approach course for the ILS RWY XXL approach into ZZZ. The ZZZ1  Approach Controller also noted to us that the previous two aircraft that had just gone into ZZZ reported heavy moderate and light severe turbulence all the way to landing, but were able to land at ZZZ. I as the Pilot Flying on the intercept course was already at Flaps 2 and called for Flaps 5 when we started to encounter moderate turbulence and very heavy precipitation. At that same time we were also given a descent altitude down to 3000 ft which I dialed into the Mode Control Panel Altitude window and used Vertical Speed to bring the aircraft down to 3000ft. At that exact moment we're in very extreme precipitation and the turbulence worsened from heavy moderate to severe and the aircraft went into CWS (Control Wheel Steering) and also went into a drastic bank angle to where the "Bank Angle" annunciation voice was heard. I disengaged the CWS mode and decided to hand fly and at that same time the Pilot Monitoring alerted ZZZ1 Approach Control that we were unable to hold heading to intercept and that we would not be able to shoot the ILS RWY XXL approach anymore . The turbulence at this point was at severe to where aircraft control was very difficult and the updrafts and downdrafts were +/- 2000 feet. At this time as well since we were in Flaps 5 the airspeed went into the red and we over speed the flaps momentarily for at least 5 seconds until the airspeed could get under control again. We told the Approach controller that we could fly heading 090 to head east and when able we would need an altitude to climb to to get us out of the weather. The Approach Controller gave us heading 080 and a  altitude to 5000ft. Once able to regain aircraft control fully and automation restored we ended up climbing to 5000 feet and on heading 090. Once we were up to altitude the Approach Controller gave us box radar vectors until we were ready to try another attempt  coming back into ZZZ again. The box radar vectors including a heading of 090 and also heading of 270. After a few box radar vectors turns the Approach Controller had informed us that the weather that was over the airport had started to move to the northeast and that the precipitation started to weaken. We both agreed to try to shoot the approach again but this time the Approach Controller recommended that the weather on the side of XXR would be better so we agreed to set up for the ILS RWY XXR approach back to the field. Once the ZZZ1 Approach Controller radar vectored us and also had us descend down to 3000 ft to set up on an intercept course for the ILS RWY XXR I called for Flaps 1 and then Flaps 5 and then again the weather on the intercept course deteriorated and I said we wouldn't be able to continue and once again we decided to not continue and ask for radar vectors to get us out of the severe weather which was extreme precipitation at this point. Upon receiving radar vectors from the approach controller to fly a specific heading and altitude to climb back up which was 5000 ft, we all of the sudden encountered an extreme updraft in excess of 5300 feet per minute and went right through 5000 ft and then the Pilot Monitoring told the Approach controller that we wouldn't be able to hold 5000 ft as assigned and then he gave us a block altitude all the way to 12000ft on a heading of 090. Once we were able to get on top above all the weather at 10500 ft and climbing to hold level at 12000 I transferred controls to the Pilot Monitoring and made a phone patch call to dispatch to make the dispatcher aware of the situation. The dispatcher and I both agreed that once we got to our reserve fuel number and if haven't made an attempt to try to come back into ZZZ that we would divert to the new assigned alternate which was ZZZ1. Once I was done with dispatch I retook controls from the Pilot Monitoring and that this time the  Approach Controller alerted us that another aircraft that had been holding as well was able to successfully make an approach and land at the airport but this time it was the ILS RWY XXL. We both agreed that we would try one more time to come into ZZZ and set up for the ILS RWY XXL approach. We were able to successfully execute the ILS RWY XX L approach and landed safely and taxied to the Ramp. Once in the ramp and all checklists were completed I made a logbook entry write up noting that the Flaps had been oversped. I also spoke to maintenance and detailed it to him and he told me that before the aircraft goes out for the next flight that they would do a detailed inspection. I also spoke to the Dispatcher and the Manager on Duty and made them both aware of what had happened. Even though the Pilot Monitoring and myself had both seen the weather on our radar screens that looked very poor and deteriorating we relied on the ZZZ Approach controller that had informed us that the weather from where he was sitting looked ok on the arrival and that it was pushing to the northeast away from where our track would take us. I also agreed to the radar vectors that the ZZZ Approach controller gave us that would take us south of the very bad weather but instead put us right in the middle of another embedded thunderstorm that was not showing up until we were already committed to the radar vectors given. The ZZZ1 Approach controller also had informed us that two previous aircraft that had gone into ZZZ prior to us had reported heavy moderate turbulence all the way to touchdown. We could have delayed our departure for at least 1 hr out of ZZZ2 and had let the weather in ZZZ push through knowing that at our original time of arrival was showing drastic weather conditions forecast for the area. The dispatcher had given us a reroute while we were en route to ZZZ which helped us get to west of the most severe weather but at our time of arriving on the ZZZZZ STAR we could've requested to hold with the fuel we had to hold with while the weather pushed through.		During our descent into ZZZ via the ZZZZZ arrival for runway XXL, we have established communication with ZZZ Approach. We were cleared to descend from 24,000ft to 14,000ft then via ZZZZZ arrival. Noticing deteriorating weather conditions on the arrival path, we requested vectors to the South to avoid the weather; however, ATC advised us the no significant weather has been reflected on his radar on the arrival path, so we continued on the arrival then we would expect radar vectors for the ILS XXL. ZZZ has given us a frequency change to contact ZZZ1 approach. Upon checking in with ZZZ1 approach, we been advised that two aircraft's ahead of us has reported heavy moderate and light severe turbulence. The aircrafts ahead of us were able to land at the airport. While on radar vectors to intercept the localizer inbound to the final approach course, we have encountered turbulence that has progressed from moderate to severe that has caused significant attitude changes and autopilot reverted to CWS. Pilot flying has disengaged the autopilot to hand fly while Pilot motoring was consistently updating PF with path deviations and advising ATC that we are not able to continue on the approach. During this even, the airplane has banked steep enough and "bank angle" alert has been activated. During the turbulence recovery, airspeed fluctuations has resulted in a flap overspeed event. We have asked approach for an Easterly heading. Approach has assigned us 080 and 5000 ft then gave us heading to remain in the boxed pattern until ready for another attempt or the weather clears up over final. ATC then advised us that the path for runway XXR has better weather conditions and rain may have weakened. PF and PM agrees to set up for RWY XXR approach for another attempt. As we were giving heading and altitudes to intercept the final approach course for XXR, PF started to configure but once again the weather has started to deteriorate. As a result, we have encountered strong updrafts and downdrafts. PM noticed updrafts up to appx 5500ft/min. PF decided to discontinue that approach and receive. We were initially assigned a heading and 5000 ft. Due to the strong updrafts, we have advised ATC that we would be unable to maintain that altitude so ATC gave us 12000 ft. After clearing the weather, PM suggested that we discontinue the Arrival into ZZZ and head to our alternate airport which was ZZZ1. PM was messaging dispatch as PF was flying and coordinating with ATC. Then, PF decided to phone patch dispatch after transferring radios and controls. After communicating with dispatch, Capt decided to divert to ZZZ1 if no other attempts has been made to return to ZZZ by the time FMC reserve is reached. FO agreed to the plan. As we kept receiving radar vectors, ATC advised us that there is another aircraft that is 12 miles away from the airport attempting the approach and if we would like to wait until they go through the approach to receive any PIREPS from that aircraft. Later, we have received PIREP that the other aircraft was able to safely land uneventful and that the weather has cleared up. We then decided to make another attempt and PM was setting up for the ILS XXL approach. This third attempt, the weather has significantly improved and landed safely without any further events. On the ground, all information has been relayed to maintenance, dispatcher and duty pilot. The biggest cause is that both PF and PM relied heavily on ATC reports even though aircraft radar was showing a deterioration in weather during the approach. We have relied on the vectors from ATC which led us to this event.We could have delayed the flight until weather showed significant improvement at the destination at ETA.Requesting a holding pattern until weather completely improves over the airport. We had enough fuel at that time to do so but we were relying more on ATC reports.We could have trusted what we are seeing with our eyes (deteriorating weather) and what's being displayed rather than completely relaying on ATC reports alone.		B737 flight crew reported encountering strong up and down drafts due to severe turbulence which resulted in a temporary loss of control during approach.

We then received an ECAM for PTU fault and completed that checklist. After talking to dispatch and maintenance control  via VHF radio, we decided to return to ZZZ.  We delayed the return flight by 10 to 20 minutes to burn enough fuel to get below our max landing weight.  On about a ten mile final we lowered the gear handle but did not get a down and locked indication, so we performed a manual gear extension.  On final, approach control vectored in another jet to land behind us even though we had already told them we were stopping on the runway.  After we told them again, that jet was assigned a different runway. Due to lack of nosewheel steering, we stopped straight ahead on runway XXC.  ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) checked us out and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.  We shut down engines as maintenance and a tug crew arrived.  Maintenance noticed hydraulic fluid dripping near the right main landing gear.  Maintenance pinned all 3 gear and the tug crew towed us in.Cause:  Hydraulic line failure/maintenance practices?

Bank angle was reduced and the turn completed normally. I had briefed at the hold-short line before takeoff that my shared mental model plan was to not retract flaps until the turn had been completed.

I was PM during this leg and started ECAM actions when directed. After turning as CAB FANS per the procedure, the initial ECAM disappeared, leading us to believe it was a spurious alert. A short moment later, I noticed what I felt was the presence of a smoke odor in the cockpit. I alerted the Captain to the smell and he agreed that it did not smell right. At this time, I called to the FWD flight attendant and asked them if everything was normal in the back. The flight attendant advised that people were starting to stand up and they were trying to figure out why. I asked if there was smoke in the cabin, and then she noticed it and advised there was smoke coming from the approximate area of rows XX-XY. Almost simultaneously, we got the AFT CARGO SMOKE ECAM again, we followed through with the entire ECAM, discharging the aft cargo agent into the bay. The Captain and I decided to [request priority handling] at this time and start heading back to ZZZ. I advised ATC and requested immediate turn back to the airport. I advised the flight attendants what was happening. At this time we received the  HYD Y RSVR LO LVL ECAM, and performed ECAM actions. Once we had started our turn and descent back towards the airport, I advised the passengers that we would be returning out of an "abundance of caution" back to ZZZ.  ATC gave us routing directly to the ILS for RWY ZZ, the Captain advised dispatch with ACARS and we continued to the airport. I continued to communicate with the FA's and requested they secure the cabin immediately for landing. The flight attendants advised they were moving passengers away from the rows to get them away from the smoke. The flight attendants advised me when the cabin was secured prior to landing.

This log was created after aircraft departed ZZZ and was in the air. On arrival the #1 engine was inspected and found that the inlet wire mesh/screen linner was out of limits by more than twice the limit. this issue should have been addressed before departing ZZZ.  The flight crew was aware of the discrepancy and intentionally chose not to report it while on the ground at ZZZ and then made a write up while in the air!!! It is obvious that the flight crew violated all the safety protocols of the company and the FAA. The flight crew departed ZZZ with known discrepancy and without reporting it. And also just for your info. the Company had scheduled 2 departures from ZZZ-ZZZ1 Day 0. The first flt was cancelled due to maintenance issues. this makes you wonder why on the log was created after taking off from ZZZ, so to prevent second flt from canceling? If the flight crew were to report this discrepancy while on the ground at ZZZ, this acft would have been OOS (Out of Service) causing further delay, disruption or cancellation. This is not the only example of pilots reporting known discrepancies while in the air!! some other examples are tires with chord showing, brakes flush, lights inop, etc, etc.Pilots should report the discrepancies when found and not decide when and how to report based on flight routing.  why wait until in the air to report a discrepancy that was discovered while on the ground at a station - regardless of it is (out station) or at (mx station). All the flight crew members, and flight attendants included, should be trained and instructed to report known discrepancies right away and not to wait regardless of where the acft is.  Safety is top priority at this company and should not be taken for granted. Always follow the SOP, FAA rules and company safety protocols for reporting known discrepancies. Why kick the problem to the next station.   Do what's right to address the issue at the present time.  What if this mesh liner came apart on take off or in flight and was ingested into engine??..   what if?? -- for example, see  the several logs at 'ZZZ2' on Day 1 for details. It is the same scenario of inlet cowl acoustic lining coming apart and was ingested into the engine causing significant damage.				Maintenance technician reported a flight crew did not report engine cowling damage prior to departure, and instead reported the damage during the flight.
