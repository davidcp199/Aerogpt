Captain accomplished ECAM actions. I was flying the airplane. Flight Manual was also used, including performance landing distance computation. An emergency was declared with Center. Request for the long Runway was issued to Approach Control. Captain coordinated with Company and Flight Attendants for our arrival. Manual gear extension was accomplished at 170 KIAS. Slight buffet and higher wind noise was experienced from open gear doors throughout landing phase. Green Hydraulic fluid level did recover slightly after gear down. Normal approach/landing. We stopped the aircraft abeam intersection 'K.' APU was started and engines were shutdown. We remained on the runway awaiting tow in to gate Approximate landing weight was 125,000 LBS. Maintenance truck that met us on runway with the super tug observed hydraulic fluid leaking from the left engine.		Descending we got an ECAM HYD G RSVR LO LVL. The First Officer flew the aircraft and declared an emergency with ATC while I performed the ECAM items. I turned off the PTU and Eng 1 Hydraulic pump per the ECAM and went into the irregular section to check for any other items.		An A320 crew reported a HYD G RSVR LO LVL ECAM during descent. An emergency was declared followed by a normal descent, approach, and tow to the gate. Hydraulic fluid was seen dripping from the left engine.

We went to open descent and retracted the flaps.  While retracting the flaps and accelerating through 180 knots, we got an ECAM 'F/CTL FLAPS LOCKED.' We maintained 180 knots and continued the descent and notified Approach Control of the issue.  While on vectors we went through the appropriate checklists and declared an emergency.  While running the checklist we got an additional ECAM of the BCSU1 had failed.  A cabin advisory was issued to the cabin and the landing was uneventful.		We were downwind abeam the airport at 8,000 feet, flaps two, gear down and 170 knots. We were asked by ATC to accelerate to 200 knots. We retracted the flaps to 1 + F and began to accelerate. As we moved the flaps to position 1 we got an F/CTL FLAPS LOCKED ECAM. While working the ECAM and appropriate checklists, we got a BSCU CH 1 FAULT ECAM. Based on the situation, we decided to notify the cabin crew of a advisory and declared an emergency with approach control. The approach and landing were uneventful.		A320 flight crew reports ECAM F/CTL FLAPS LOCKED during descent for approach. While working the the procedure for the flaps a second ECAM is displayed for BSCU1 FAULT. An emergency is declared.

The flight crew informed me they had a source display fault on the Number 1 DEU (Digital Electronic Unit). This is a common fault and it is our normal procedure to reset the DEU to correct the fault. I gave the flight crew the reset procedure and the fault cleared. When the crew came back after the reset the Captain said, 'sorry it took so long to get back we had to do a little aviating and make sure our wings were level because we lost our screens for a bit.' This was the first time I realized he was in flight. I would never reset this system in flight. The flight continued to its destination with no incident.				Unaware the B737-800 was in flight, a Maintenance Technician initiated remote system reset of a source display fault for the Number one DEU.  The flight crew experienced a short term loss of their navigation and primary flight displays as result.

Feeling of being tired, irritable, yawning. The reason for the fatigue was the inhumane schedule the automated bidding system awarded for the month of December and January. Basically working 8 days on 1 day off then 6 days on. 1 day off in 15. This schedule caused a chronic fatigue of either sleep and wake times inconsistent. Five long 25 hour plus, boring and fatiguing layovers in both east and west time zones, and 2 all night events. Basically no personal down time. This all being legal because the crew scheduling department designs unproductive low flight hour, long layover trips.  Average was 3.8 hours of flying per day thus there was no 30/7 problem but chronic fatigue because of no time off. Additional cause of the fatigue that morning was a restless nights sleep due to a family situation at home. The problem with pilot fatigue at my air carrier is solely caused by poor scheduling and line construction which has no regard to pilot lifestyle. My air carrier is intentionally oppressing the pilot group trying to suck the life out of them as much as possible, hoping they will quit, to weaken them without regard to safety. Safety was never jeopardized on the flight. I was released from duty and allowed to go home after being gone almost 2 weeks.				A320 Captain laments the schedule created by the company's automated bidding system creates and reports calling in fatigued after nearly 14 days on the road.

We were cleared for an ILS Runway 10R Approach to PDX. FDC NOTAMS indicated that CAT II/III was not available (no reason given) to this runway, however that seemed to not be a factor since the weather was above CAT I minimums. As we approached the area there seemed to be a delay in the IPDX text identifier displaying on the Flat Panel ND that would normally indicate a valid ILS signal was being received. I listened to the Aural ID and it indicated correctly. We were cleared for the approach and while on an intercept heading for the approach we appeared to have a valid localizer signal for the approach. We continued and then noticed that the autopilot did not intercept the localizer. I selected the approach/localizer mode to display RAW DATA and confirmed that we were not intercepting the localizer. Using heading select and raw data the flying pilot intercepted the localizer. We began the approach and shortly after crossing YORKY the pilot flying reported that he had localizer and glideslope FAIL FLAGS in view...shortly after, I lost localizer and glideslope information as well and we executed a missed approach. We contacted PDX approach on the missed and reported loss of signal and queried them if they had anyone else report any ILS anomalies. The Controller indicated that they had had multiple reports of unreliable signals from the ILS system and that is why they decertified the CAT II/III approaches. We requested and were cleared for the PDX RNAV (GPS) Runway 10R approach and landed without further incident. There appears to be construction going on at the PDX airport that may be a factor in the ILS Anomalies. After landing I immediately contacted our Dispatch and requested that an ACARS message be sent to all inbound flights warning of the possibility of the ILS being unusable and that the RNAV approach should be briefed for CAT I use into PDX.				B737 Captain reported anomalies with the ILS 10R at PDX that caused a go around. A NOTAM was in effect for CAT II/III approaches to this runway but nothing concerning CAT I.

We were at flaps 2 speed 180 as we rolled onto final at 15 miles and 3000 FT.  In the turn we got an ECAM 'HYD G RSVR LO LVL.'  I told the First Officer to do the ECAM checklist, I have the plane and radios. I tried to slow us down to give him time to work the problem and called for 'Gear Down' and we got the 'L/G GEAR NOT DOWNLOCKED' ECAM. At this point we needed some time to figure out what was going on and I told Tower we were unable to land and needed to overfly the airport to work on a hydraulic problem. We received instructions to turn to 300 degrees maintain 3000 FT, contact SOCAL. The First Officer and I had a quick discussion of what systems were inoperative and agreed our destination was out of the question and we should go to ZZZ as he continued working the ECAM checklist. I contacted Approach and told them we were having a hydraulic problem and need to go to ZZZ. He asked if we were an emergency aircraft, I stated not at this time but we will let him know if conditions change. I called the flight attendants and told them the nature of the problem and this was a Cabin Advisory get out your checklist and review the next step in case we run into more problems.  We then got a TCAS 'Traffic' alert followed by a 'Climb' RA. I performed the climb maneuver until clear of conflict. We reviewed the checklist of inoperative items and I determined we should declare an emergency due to the fact we had to hand crank the gear down and ground steering was inoperative upon landing. As we reviewed the items we noticed we had hydraulic quantity (almost to the normal range) in the Green system that was not there when this whole ECAM process started. We turned the pump back on and had 3000 PSI on the Green system and all the ECAMs cleared from the screen. Not knowing how long it would stay pressurized I called for gear down and flaps to full to get configured for landing. We advised LAX Tower we would like the fire trucks in place as a precaution and we may not be able to turn off the runway. The landing was made in the touchdown zone and all systems operated normally. Fire crews followed us to the gate where the flight was terminated. Due to the close proximity of our destination to ZZZ we were able to make a quick decision to divert. We were very limited in time due to the fact it was a nice day with no weather forecast and we did not have a lot of extra fuel. The cockpit environment was very busy with radio calls, checklist, passenger and cabin crew communications. We were unable to contact Dispatch and advise them of the diversion due to the fuel/time limitations, reprogramming of boxes and checklists. We did not declare an emergency because we were able to get the airplane fully configured and made a stabilized approach. We landed at ZZZ with 3,600 pounds of fuel remaining.		Our destination was not a good option due to short runway and the potential for loss of steering and normal braking. It was difficult to insert the new destination due to the overflying of the original destination--FMGC box sequence, etc. Eventually completed, though took longer than normal due to lack of a 'new destination' prompt. I have been on the Bus for a long time and know how to do this--but the FMGC was sequencing as we overflew our original destination and the 'new destination' prompt was not offered despite several attempts.Extensive radio communications with atc in the busy terminal area was very distracting and made for difficult division of duties between flying and configuring the aircraft, reviewing systems and status, etc.		An A320 diverted to an airport with a longer runway when they got a Green System Hydraulic low quantity ECAM message on final to the single short runway at their destination.  Busy terminal traffic, heavy ATC communications load and low fuel quantity for the diversion trumped their ability to contact Dispatch until at the gate at the diversion airport.

This was routine. A few minutes after reaching FL400, the power levers retarded to idle, the over speed clacker was heard and the Primary Flight Display on the Captain's side was showing completely inaccurate airspeed, altitude and vertical speed information. The 'A' autopilot disengaged as well. The First Officer's Primary Flight Display was unaffected so I transferred control of the aircraft to him by making his flight director the master. We ran numerous QRH checklists but the problem still persisted. Since the First Officer's side was not affected, I elected to continue on to our destination. I then started a descent to FL360 to give us more buffet margin in case the false airspeed indications continued. As soon as we left FL400, all problems with my PFD stopped and everything was normal for the rest of the flight. I elected to let the First Officer land the aircraft just in case my PFD malfunctioned again. I also chose to continue based of the lower terrain since this flight was at night.  Maintenance met us and performed numerous tests. The cause was not immediately identified but the FMC showed 48 events of a malfunctioning ADIRU-1.				Multiple and intermittent primary flight display and autopilot problems occurred on a B737 during cruise.  Crew elected to continue to destination.

The Captain, without verbalizing it, decided to fly off to one side of the center of the arrival route ostensibly to avoid the wake turbulence. I noticed what he was doing and asked if he would prefer to offset to one side of the track within the RNP limits. He said no, he would manually do it to maintain his mental acuity. As soon as I turned back, I noticed and notified the Captain that we were 500 FT below the minimum altitude for the next waypoint. He immediately climbed back to the correct altitude. As we approached the correct altitude, ATC asked us for verification of the altitude. No further comments were made by ATC concerning altitude. The Captain chose to fly the aircraft off the RNAV course and refuse my recommendation to use the offset function that would have continued to abide by altitude constraints. If the Captain had notified ATC of the wake turbulence, they may have allowed an alternate descent profile which would have required less monitoring. If he had verbalized his plan, I could have spoken up and made an alternate recommendation. There are some pilots whose complacency has become so ingrained that they become at odds with SOP's and choose to rationalize making up their own. Simply line checking on short hops doesn't catch the pilot who exhibits this behavior when they are tired or trying to expedite their last leg home. Line checks need to be done much more often and on a mix of long and short legs if they are to achieve any usefulness beyond checking a regulatory box.				A321 First Officer reports altitude deviation by the Captain flying when attempting to hand fly off the RNAV arrival to avoid wake turbulence.

All tires had good tread remaining on them. Maintenance serviced the tires and we proceeded on time. The flight, including descent and approach, was normal. First Officer performed a 40-flap landing with auto brakes 2 selected. The touchdown was on speed, smooth and in the touchdown zone, although the aircraft settled a bit harshly when the spoilers deployed. First Officer began applying brakes and the auto brakes disarmed. At one point it felt as if the brakes suddenly grabbed, but we felt no unusual vibration in the cockpit. As we slowed further the anti-skid fail light came on.  We turned off the runway and began taxiing to the gate. The PSEU light on the overhead illuminated and before turning towards the jetway I noticed the green gear down light for the right main gear was no longer illuminated and stopped the aircraft. The First Officer pointed out the green light for the right main was illuminated on the overhead panel. The aircraft was not listing and otherwise felt normal while taxiing, so I continued to the gate. After stopping at the gate the First Officer checked the hydraulics and stated that the A system was losing fluid and was now showing an 'RF'. I went outside and found the number 3 tire had blown and the tread separated. The loose tread had cut one of the A system hydraulic lines and had pulled out wire bundles from the wheel well area near the main strut. It also damaged a bracket in the same area, as well as some skin damage to the lower wing, both fore and aft of the well area. We notified Tower and had them sweep the runway of the separated remnants prior to the next aircraft's arrival. When I went down to look, ground personnel were already containing the hydraulic fluid spill around the right gear. When I asked the flight attendants, the two in back of the plane said they felt a thumping sound from the gear on rollout. No passengers or crew were injured and none of the passengers mentioned hearing any sound or unusual occurrence when they deplaned.				A B737-800 Flight Crew reported main gear tire failure on landing, possibly due to an antiskid malfunction. There was some damage to the aircraft from the loose tread.

At 11,000 FT with AP/AT/LNAV engaged, we began to experience a severe vibration and popping noise. Neither of us had experienced this before. No cockpit indications of a problem. The First Officer turned off the AP/AT and reduced power and the vibration and popping began to stop. The Lead Flight Attendant called and said that there were flames coming out of the right side of the aircraft. At the same time the airspeed began to decrease so the First Officer added power and it started all over again shaking and popping. A Company Mechanic was on board and called and said that flames were coming out of the #2 engine and it was a possible compressor stall. The First Officer increased the #1 thrust lever and it operated normally. I used the engine shut down memory items and we declared an emergency. I made a PA to the passengers and flight attendants. We ran the Engine Shutdown checklist followed by the Single Engine Landing checklist. At 2,000 FT I took the controls and the First Officer completed the landing computations. We landed safely, then pulled off the runway and talked to CFR and the passengers. We taxied to the jetway. No injuries were involved. A logbook entry was made.				Alerted by severe vibration, loud popping and a Flight Attendant's report of fire from the right engine, the flight crew of a B737-700 descending for landing shut down the engine, declared an emergency and landed at their destination airport.

While reviewing the Maintenance Release, the First Officer reported the forward lavatory toilet flushed normally. Water (H20) quantity was checked and it was found to be full, in direct contrast to the MEL instructions for the deferral on the Maintenance Release. Maintenance Control was contacted and a Maintenance Report item sent. Contract Maintenance called to aircraft in ZZZ and he reinstated the water system as no faults could be located.  A few other write-ups were handled by ZZZ Maintenance Technician and he left the aircraft, with the Deferral placard still located on the forward Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) panel.  This item was not discovered until en-route to ZZZ1. Aircraft was not serviced with potable water in ZZZ, so it operated at least one leg in violation of the MEL.  The ZZZ Maintenance Technician stated the aircraft appeared to be not configured correctly for the 'No' potable water operation as all the valves had been left open.  If the aircraft had a frozen water system as originally expected in the first write-up, how can one drain a water system that is frozen?  Rhetorical question but that was the procedure listed under the MEL.				An A320 Pilot reports about a deferral of the potable water system that did not comply with the MEL procedures for their A320. Captain also asks 'if the aircraft had a frozen water system as originally expected in the first write-up, how can one drain a water system that is frozen'?

Uneventful go around and subsequent landing executed. Following day I was advised that NORCAL wished to talk to me. Spoke to Quality Control and realized that we do not view this in the same light. I do not see the need for me to fly in trail of a heavy when operating to parallel rwys within 2500 feet of each other. I see no reason for me not to have been vectored abeam, ahead or a little in trail (1/4 to 1/2 mile) as opposed to 1 mile in trail when the turbulence reaches max levels. In addition, approach speed difference would mean I would fall further behind and more into the danger zone. I thought ATC was supposed to maintain responsibility for my heavy turbulence clearance until it issues me the visual clearance. If this is true then how could I have gotten to 1 mile in trail if they did not violate this requirement. My main reason for this report is the disagreement (cordial) between NORCAL and I as to; #1 the importance of NORCAL maintaining heavy separation for me until I accept a visual clearance; #2 NORCAL stated policy to me that putting me ahead, abeam or inside 1/2 mile in trail is not as important to them as closure rates or the fear that the 767 might pass me and consequently need to go around; and #3 their complete befuddlement at why a pilot would refuse such a clearance; quote 'no other pilots have done that'.				Unhappy with spacing behind a B767 on approach to parallel runway, an A320 Flight Crew executes go around at SFO.

Crew performed ECAM actions. Next notified Company Dispatch (via ACARS) and reviewed AOM for further guidance. After review of AOM procedures to see if affected item required any special procedures. There was one which would affect our flight. Do not operate into known or forecast icing conditions.  In addition, the procedures required that we descend to FL310 and avoid icing conditions. We contacted ATC and requested descent to FL 310 and contacted company to advise about the MEL.  This is were the crew and company saw things differently. The Captain established a phone patch to speed up communications and express our concerns regarding the inop ENG 2 Bleed Air. Our concerns regarding MEL requirements of known icing and FL 310 required diverting to an airport with no known/forecast icing, however, the company's repeated view of the no MEL situation on the aircraft and no restrictions from the AOM allowed us to continue to our ice impacted destination at FL 390. This discussion lasted while we continued northbound toward our original destination. I, being the Flying Pilot, handled the aircraft and communications with ATC, while the Captain communicated with the company. He provided operating manual references which state: If any instrument or item of equipment required for the particular operation becomes inoperative en route, the Captain shall comply with the approved procedures for such occurrence as specified elsewhere in this manual, the AOM, applicable MEL's/CDL's, and any pertinent FAR's.  The Captain and I discussed the issue at length, and made the decision to divert to an airport with no known icing due to inop AIR ENG 2 Bleed Fault and MEL restrictions, which we did. This maintenance diversion caused the crew to exceed eight hours within 24 hours which required 18 hours rest and removal from the next day's trip.		It is the opinion of this Captain and crew that these events were precipitated by management's decision to continue the flight without regards to the FAR's, safety of operation, and/or adherence to company issued manuals. This crew was PUSHED repeatedly to continue to our destination without regards for safety. When Dispatch and or management disagree with a Captain in regards to the safe operation of an aircraft, the safest course of action should always be taken without the extreme pressure that this crew encountered.		After suffering the loss of an engine bleed an A320 Flight Crew encountered resistance from Maintenance and Management regarding their decision to divert to a station with no known icing as required by the company's operating manuals.

Shortly after crossing the ECA VOR, we were given radar vectors off of the arrival, and a descent clearance to 8000 feet.  The vectors took us directly over the Byron (identifier C83) airport, and generally toward Mt. Diablo.  We then entered IMC.  As briefed in the approach briefing, the MSA for our sector was 5100 feet, with Mt. Diablo at an elevation of +-3900 feet.  We were cleared and descended to 5000 ft, and began to slow from 250 KIAS to 200 KIAS as we were approaching the SFO Class B airspace boundary.  Both the Captain and I had our NAV Displays set to Weather Radar as we entered into light rain showers.  I temporarily set my NAV Display back to Terrain to see if it would 'paint' Mt. Diablo, (which it did not), and then switched back to Weather.  Shortly after switching back to Weather, we received a GPWS 'Terrain, Terrain, Pull-up, Pull-up.'  By the second 'Pull-up', I had initiated the GPWS Terrain escape maneuver (as outlined in the Flight Manual), and concurrently the Captain advised NorCal Approach that we were climbing due to the GPWS Terrain warning.  The warning ceased almost immediately after the initiation of the climb.  NorCal Approach re-cleared us, when able, to descend to 4000 feet.  Recovery from the climb started at about 6000 feet, and (to my recollection) never exceeded 7000 feet, at which point we began a slow descent back down to 4000 feet.  During the descent back to 4000 feet, I re-engaged the autopilot and autothrust.  At this point we were approximately on the OAK VOR 015 at 15DME.    We broke out into VMC shortly thereafter, continued to get vectors onto the localizer for the OAK ILS 11, and made an uneventful visual approach and landing.  The hardest part of the whole event, was trying not to keep thinking about what just happened (GPWS Warning), but to focus on what still needed to be done (approach and landing).  The Captain did a great job of communicating with ATC, verifying our clearances and status of aircraft configuration with regard to autofight, position etc. with me.  There was no other mention of the event by ATC.		Clean configuration. Without warning, we received a 'Too Low, Terrain. Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull Up'. There was no pop-up feature on the ND. The First Officer immediately performed the escape maneuver, and I told ATC that we were climbing for a terrain warning. The terrain warning ceased climbing through around 6500 feet, and we leveled close to 7000 feet. ATC cleared us back down to 4000 feet when able, and we began a gradual descent back down to that altitude, with the First Officer's terrain function on.		A320 Flight Crew experiences a GPWS terrain warning at 5000 feet during vectors to OAK. The Crew takes evasive action and informs ATC.

The First Officer inadvertently moved the flap handle thinking it was the speed brake handle. I immediately moved the flap handle back to zero. The warning horn went off for no more than 5 seconds so I know the slats didn't fully extend.  After regrouping, we continued the approach and landing uneventfully. I sent an overspeed write up in to Maintenance Control. After the flight I also called Dispatch to inform them what had happened. Dispatch and I also talked to Maintenance Control on the phone to make sure if any other action was required after the flight. Maintenance Control said no.  The First Officer is new to the airplane and mistook the flap handle for the speed brake handle.		As First Officer, I was the Flying Pilot. We had been taken off the STAR and given direct to the outer marker prior to our descent. Then, we were assigned to cross 30NM west of the outer marker at 11,000 feet. As we were approaching near the top of descent, I was heads down in the MCDU trying to create a fix for situational reference, however, this became a major distraction. The waypoint I had created was not accurate and I started down in the descent early for our crossing restriction. Believing that I might be high, I pulled out what I thought were the speedbrakes when in actuality it was the flap lever. The speed at the time was 280kts at at altitude of 17,000 feet. Instantly, ECAM alert and master warning ocurred. The Captain immediately diagnosed the problem and had me stow the flaps back to zero. The flap overspeed warning sounded for 5 seconds or less. Fatigue was not a factor. You can have a quick mind but in aviation but need hands slow as molasses. Subsequent landing was uneventful.		A320 First Officer inadvertently grabs flap handle to extend speed brakes at 17000 feet and 280 knots. Over speed warning sounds and flaps are quickly retracted.

I called the A Flight Attendant located in the forward galley to ask if she felt anything, her comments were, 'I hear the sound and there is a vibration on the floor when I stand in front of the forward galley'. I notified Dispatch via ACARS of the humming noise,and sent Maintenance a log item via ACARS. On descent the humming noise increased and an electrical smell was noticed for the first time in the cockpit.  Called the Flight Attendant again to ask if she smelled anything unusual, her reply was: 'I don't smell anything back here'. There was never any smoke present associated with the noise or electrical smell.  After switching to Approach Control I declared an emergency with ATC, requested priority handling and fire rescue equipment standing, we got cleared for the visual approach.  In the mean time, I called the A Flight Attendant again to inform her of the emergency and directed her to conduct a Cabin Advisory.  Upon landing, we requested an outside visual inspection of the airplane for possible smoke or heat signature, none was noted by the fire personnel.  We taxied to the gate followed closely by firefighting equipment.  Enroute to the gate, the noise increased as did the electrical smell until a CB tripped and the noise stopped.  Upon arrival at the gate, we where met by firefighting personnel who found no heat signatures in the cockpit.  After that the passengers deplaned normally.				A320 flight crew reports slight vibration in the cockpit floor and electrical fumes during descent. An emergency is declared and normal landing ensues. During taxi-in the vibration increases then stops at the sound of a circuit breaker tripping.

Deployed the #2 normally but had to pull three times to get the #1 TR to unlock. Both Thrust Levers were against the idle stop. Logbook entry made. This airplane had some other curious electrical issues this day that make me wonder if there has been a recent lightning strike or other electrical anomaly. Earlier, when we did our Before Start Originating checklist, the First Officer and I both recall verifying the autothrottle switch in the OFF position. However, upon being cleared for takeoff and advancing the thrust levers when I engaged TOGA, the autothrottles engaged and we found the switch in the ON position. I could possibly have bumped the switch at some point, but I don't think I did. I certainly don't recall being close to it at any point. Later on, the TCAS failed on both transponders. I cycled the TCAS circuit breaker once and the system returned to normal. On the next leg we received a 'Single FMC' message. I placed the FMC switch to 'Both on 1', stayed there for a moment and then back on both and the FMC system operated normally the remainder of the evening. I made no logbook entries on these issues as they were spurious, one time events, which corrected themselves so they couldn't be duplicated. When taken together though over the course of the three legs, it appears there may be some spurious electrical anomaly in the aircraft.		The Captain wrote up the failure of the deployment of the Thrust Reverser in ZZZ.		A recalcitrant left reverser on a B737-700 reminds the flight crew of previous spurious problems with the aircraft.

The visibility was less than 1 mile with the sky obscured. I elected to have the First Officer start the #2 engine early for warm up requirements and also so greater attention could be given to the taxi out. As we approached the ILS hold short line I could tell the airplane did not sound 'normal' but could not tell why. The take off was normal but the engine sound seemed to have a slightly higher pitch. As we were climbing through about 5000, I realized that the packs were not on. I immediately told the First Officer to turn on one pack, allow the cabin to stabilize, then turn on the second pack. I did not notice any bump or sense of pressure change. The flight continued without incident. I knew the airplane did not sound right and continued to look for a reason to support my feeling.  I think the bottom line is I did not follow up behind my First Officer. The packs show up on the checklist multiple times so there is no excuse for me to miss the pack switch position.  Our trip was scheduled to finish with this leg and we were to then deadhead to our crew base. My First Officer commutes from our destination so it is my personal belief that he had mentally checked out. His plan was to get to our destination and go home.				A B737-700 flight crew failed to insure the air conditioning packs were on prior to takeoff.  The oversight was noted during the initial climb and the packs turned on.

At that time I took control of the aircraft while the First Officer ran the appropriate check lists. It was determined through ECAMs and in talking with Maintenance Control and Dispatch that we had lost our Green Hydraulic System. We then declared an Emergency and ran the Appropriate Checklists for approach and landing: Landing distances required, Gravity Gear Extension, Tow in. I also had the purser do a Cabin Advisory. After briefing the Purser and passengers we prepared for landing with a brief about what to expect and when checklists would need to be run. I landed the aircraft and stopped on the runway. We were towed to the gate after the aircraft was secured by ground personnel and CFR.		At cruise, FL360, ECAM message 'HYD G SYS LO PR' appeared, followed by 'HYD G RSVR LO LVL'. At that time, the Captain took control of the aircraft while I ran the ECAM and checklist. At the completion of the ECAM, a subsequent ECAM 'G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR' illuminated. It was a result of the previous ECAM actions. As a result of the loss of Green System hydraulic fluid and no chance to recover the Green system, the checklist advised that we had lost Nose Wheel Steering and that the we would have to do a gravity extend of the landing gear. The Captain and I discussed the situation. The Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control to alert them to our condition and discuss options. At that time, considering our condition, a landing at ZZZ was our best option. The Captain declared an emergency with ATC and informed them of our decision to continue to ZZZ.  The Captain contacted the #1 Flight Attendant to inform her of the situation and directed a cabin advisory. At that time I completed the Landing Distances Required performance considerations. Runway 7 was more than adequate. Other considerations for the landing were a loss of normal brakes, the number 1 reverser and some spoilers. Approach to the terminal area was normal. The emergency equipment was standing by for our arrival. On downwind, I ran the Landing Gear Gravity Extend Checklist and extended the landing gear. With the loss of the Nosewheel Steering, the decision was made to stop on the runway. Landing was normal. The Captain brought the aircraft to a stop straight ahead and set the parking brakes. We completed the after landing flows. The APU was started and the engines were shut down.  I completed the Tow In checklist. Emergency personnel inspected the aircraft and cleared it for towing. Ground personnel pinned the landing gear and connected the tug. Ground cleared us to the gate.		An A320 flight crew declared an emergency, performed the appropriate checklists and landed safely after suffering a Green Hydraulic System failure.

This was my first flight from Hawaii to the main land as I normally fly to Asia. The Captain accepted the fuel as planned, and I found no reason to disagree. When we got our fuel we were fueled exactly at cleared plus taxi. On rotation we had 79.9 on board vs plan at 80.2 if memory serves correctly...so there we are down 300 lbs. Next we did not get FL390, we got FL330 a 6000 lb bust...I expressed concern to the Captain as we were planned with only 900 lbs extra at the ETP. He contacted Dispatch immediately and told me that he thought Track A was a good plan...I had no reason again to disagree so we got clearance from HCF to go to Alpha track. Captain notified Dispatch and they STRONGLY recommended not going to Alpha but to stay on Charlie. We followed their advice and proceeded on Charlie. At the first checkpoint we were down over 1000 lbs. and knew we were in trouble on the ETP. The Captain called Dispatch and for the next hour we tried every possible idea to find a a way to continue. Ten minutes prior to the ETP we were down 2800 lbs for the ETP required fuel. We notified Oakland by CPDLC we needed to turn back and got clearance to do so. We did everything possible to complete the flight successfully but there was no way to continue without FAR required fuel on board. In hind sight, on these crowded tracks I should have advocated adding fuel in case we get stuck low. In the future I will do so as forcefully as I can.				B777 First Officer reports insufficient fuel to continue a flight from Hawaii to the main land which requires a turn back. Crew had planned FL390 but were assigned FL330 for the crossing.

During approach to Seattle, ATIS said visual approaches were in use for 16L and 16R.  At about 20 miles out we were given vectors to 16C.  Another carrier 737, northwest of the field, was also being vectored to 16R at the same time.  ATC sequenced the two aircraft on parallel approaches with numerous speed assignments, but the aircraft still ended up almost abeam each other.  The other jet was slightly in front of us and above us. ATC gave us a clearance for a visual approach and at 3000 FT MSL we received a 'Descend Descend' RA on the other carrier.  We were assigned a speed (I believe it was 150 KTS). The RA had us descending at 1800 FPM, so I complied per the FOM.  The RA continued for 1500 FT until about 1800 FT MSL.  I then said, 'this is not going to work.'  We were well below glide path and approaching 1000 FT AGL with a rapid descent rate and with the 737 in sight, still slightly above and in front of us. The RA was simply going to drive us into the ground.  I suspect if we had continued with the RA guidance, eventually we would have received a Terrain Warning!  At 1400 FT AGL I again said to the Captain, 'This is not going to work. We need to break off the approach to the left.' He agreed, and as soon as I started to break off to the left and gain some lateral separation, we received a 'Clear of Conflict' and returned to the visual approach with a stabilized approach at 1000 FT AGL. The remainder of the approach and landing was uneventful.  If the TCAS equipment on our aircraft and the other carrier's 737 was all working, the other carrier should have received a climb RA and should have responded.  This would have immediately relieved our Descend RA. The Company should issue an immediate safety alert about this problem.  Union Safety tells me that this has been an ongoing problem at SEA.  It should have been resolved the first time it happened. If not issuing an alert, then rewrite the FOM to address a DESCEND RA in the descent/landing environment/landing configuration, i.e. how do you execute a go-around with a constant descending RA? Consider turning the TCAS to TA only at 8 miles. Consider asking SEA TRACON not to sequence aircraft to 16C with parallel arrivals on 16R.				B737 First Officer on visual approach to Runway 16C at SEA reports TCAS RA on another B737 slightly ahead for Runway 16R. Attempts to comply with the RA are not successful until the reporter turns away from the intruder aircraft.

Aircraft 100 miles ahead at FL360 reported continuous severe encounters and bank angles left and right up to 30 degrees. We attempted to get reroute left of course and Center was unable to approve. We declared emergency, squawked 7700 and deviated left of course 60 NM and descended to FL325. Ultimately we did get clearance to continue flight 60 nm left of track at FL330. Sigmet 5 was out for severe turbulence, but we were well ahead of and 1000 feet below lowest forecast altitude. Later found out that aircraft in the middle of the sigmet block at FL360 had encountered only moderate turbulence for about 15 minutes. It appears that the sigmet was inaccurate in detailing the area of concern and it had shifted further south. At the time all passengers were seated with the seatbelt sign on. I had notified all the Flight Attendants of possible turbulence ahead,and they had done a cabin walk through checking belts. When the severe turbulence hit we had been encountering only light turbulence up to that point. Two Flight Attendant's were not seated. One got to a seat right away, and the other sat down in the aisle. No injuries reported. Outside weather was widespread high cirrus clouds. Great assistance from dispatch, and ATC.		The airplane was experiencing +/-25 knots accompanied with minor bank angle changes and minor altitude deviations. The autopilot never kicked off. During the encounter, there were at least two, possibly 3 overspeeds. After determining that other aircraft up ahead were also experiencing severe turbulence. The Captain and I decided to laterally deviate south to steer clear of the now known and verified area. Because of a fuel gauge issue and the fuel burn down low, descent was not the first option, although we would not rule it out if needed. We immediately turned 45 degrees left and began broadcasting our maneuvers. The Captain brought another First Officer back up to the cockpit to help with communications. We sought a route deviation from Center of 1 degree further south routing. Initially it was rejected. In the meantime, using the Captain's emergency authority, we descended 500 FT and flew a 10 mile left offset of that new 1 deg further south routing, paralleling our original route. After a few minutes, Center called us back and approved our request for the new routing and altitude (unchanged at FL330). During the maneuvers, the turbulence continued, but it was never as bad as the first minute or so. It gradually diminished, and we were able to turn the seat belt sign off about 30 minutes later.		B777 flight crew reported encountering severe turbulence at FL330 over the North Atlantic. The Captain exercised her emergency authority to deviate 60 NM south when a timely clearance cannot be obtained from Center.

Inside the final approach fix the glide-slope appeared to become intermittently erratic. We subsequently received a low altitude alert from the Control Tower, along with a glide-slope alert at approximately 1,000 FT AGL. At this point we had the runway environment in sight and continued to an uneventful landing. The Control Tower indicated that a heavy aircraft had been taxiing past the ILS transmitters.		This happened at 1,000 AGL and we got the ground in view at the same time. The weather was 1,000 FT overcast and visibility 5 NM.		Just as they broke out of the overcast, the flight crew of an A320 received glide slope warning and an ATC generated low altitude alert due to a heavy jet taxiing through the ILS glideslope transmitter signal. The flight continued to an uneventful landing.

Random route over the Atlantic. One PIREP and SIGMET from Center for moderate to severe turbulence along our route. Prior shift had tried to alter course and altitude and ATC was unable to accommodate. Approaching area of possible turbulence, we briefed the flight attendants to secure the cabin and turned on the fasten seatbelt sign with an especially strong announcement to stay seated. Seatbelt sign had been on for some 10 minutes prior to encountering any turbulence at all. Encountered moderate and then severe turbulence. Made the decision to declare an Emergency and followed SOP for an emergency descent to FL280 as that had been reported smooth. FL280 was much better so we stayed at that altitude until we could coordinate with ATC for subsequent climb and continue to destination. No injuries reported. Captain (who was on break) did an excellent job of briefing and establishing a game plan for possible turbulence. His obvious confidence in his crew made it easy to make a timely decision.		Cruising at FL290 and 290 KTS hit moderate to severe turbulence and requested immediate descent to FL280. Center could not issue an immediate clearance to descend so we slowed to 280 KTS and declared emergency and descended to FL280 because of the severe turbulence.		B777 flight crew experienced severe turbulence over the North Atlantic at FL290. When ATC cannot issue a descent clearance in a timely manor, the crew exercised emergency authority and descended to FL280.

Maintenance in ZZZ deferred the valve by locking it open.  Following MEL and ECAM procedures still left the aircraft with hot bleed air being sent into the right wing leading edge through the wired 'Open' wing anti-ice valve.  My Copilot and I were not comfortable flying for an extended period of time with a known bleed air leak on the right wing.  Based on our experience we decided the safest course of action was to treat this maintenance condition as a bleed air leak. After takeoff and climbout from ZZZ1, in moderate icing conditions, where we used wing anti-ice ['On' for] both bleed valves, we isolated the right wing.  Number 2 bleed - Off, Cross bleed valve -Closed, and Pack 2 -Off (although it would be off anyway with no bleed air on the right wing).  We flew to ZZZ2 at FL310 (single pack altitude) and we added fuel in ZZZ1 to account for the lower altitude. I feel that the MEL should be readdressed to determine the danger of flying around with a manufactured bleed air leak and just allowing the  Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMCs) to monitor and detect an overheat after the damage has already been done.  A bleed air leak is one of the most dangerous emergencies that can occur and could possibly lead to a wing fire.  I feel that we operated the aircraft in the safest way possible with the Right Wing Anti-Ice valve wired open.		Aircraft was dispatched from ZZZ to ZZZ1 with Wing Anti-ice valve stuck open.  Aircraft arrived with significant ice on leading edges of all lifting surfaces as well as significant icing under wing area between engine and hull.  Our leg-ZZZ1 to ZZZ2.  The MEL did not address anything other than engine start, taxi, and takeoff.  MEL should have addressed cruise configurations as well.  We decided the only way we'd take aircraft was to isolate the problem and prevent bleed air from entering the wing while flying.  During climbout, above icing conditions, we shut the crossbleed, turned off engine bleed 2, turned off Pack 2, cruised to ZZZ2 at FL 10 single pack, with no bleed air on the wing.  We left the APU on for added safety precaution.  There was a SERIOUS judgment error by the Routers, as well as Dispatch, to send this aircraft into known moderate icing.  MEL should address specific configuration at all phases of flight. Simply because something CAN be done, does not mean it SHOULD be done.		A Captain and Copilot report about their A320 being dispatched with the Right Wing Anti-ice valve deferred in the wired 'Open' position. The MEL allegedly did not address anything other than Engine Start, Taxi and Takeoff.

As 'Recall' was pressed in conjunction with the Descent Checklist, the verbiage on the First Officer's recall system displayed identical to the Captain's recall lens cover. After gate arrival, the Captain reviewed the Logbook and found the assembly had been replaced [days earlier]. Maintenance was summoned and attempted to swap the [lens] light cover with the proper lens for the First Officer's side; however upon installation of the replacement [lens], the assembly would not illuminate. Further investigation revealed the [electrical] socket assembly installed earlier, although bearing the appropriate Manufacturer's Part Number (according to the Mechanic), was in fact a Captain's socket assembly (left side) and would work with a First Officer's lens cover (right side). The pins on the lens were left/right side socket specific. The incorrect installation was not readily discernible to flight crews since all twelve Annunciators on the 'six-packs' would illuminate and apparently function normally. Only by reading the lettering on the lens was the error identified.				While performing a 'Before Landing' Checklist on a B737-800, a Captain and First Officer noticed the First Officer's Master Warning Annunciator panel 'six-pack' lights had identical verbiage displayed as the Captain's 'Recall' Annunciator 'six-pack' panel. Lettering for individual annunciator lights on First Officer's panel should be different than Captain's panel.

At that time we got an ECAM for Green System low hydraulic quantity.  I accomplished the ECAM by turning off the PTU and the green (#1) system engine pump.  This gives you a second ECAM Green Sys Low Press.  I decided it best for me to fly the aircraft and coordinate with ATC while the First Officer worked the ECAM.  He also referenced the flight manual for any notes/warnings/cautions.  I declared an emergency with ATC and notified the company.  I also asked for some delay vectors to give us a little more time to work the problem.  We had about 4600 lbs of fuel at this point so we didn't have a lot of extra time to work with. I gave a cabin advisory to the Lead Flight Attendant and since we had a deadheading Airbus Captain on board I had him come to the cockpit to back us up on anything we might have overlooked or anything else we might consider.  Satisfied, we told ATC we were ready for the approach.  The landing gear free fell as advertised and we landed uneventfully.  I was able to make the turn off the runway, but with no nosewheel steering stopped clear of the runway. We started the APU, shut down the engines, let the fire department check the aircraft and, given the okay, were towed to the gate.				An A320 suffered the loss of the green  hydraulic system.

She indicated that she was hearing a loud hiss from the forward entrance door after the ten thousand foot ding. We elected to continue our climb as the pressurization seemed relatively normal at this point, and we hoped the door seal would seal itself as the cabin PSI increased. I asked the A to call us back if the hiss continued. ATC continued our climb clearances to our cruise altitude. Our A called back and said the loud hiss continued. We leveled off at FL290 to check cabin rate. The cabin was climbing at 900 to 1000 ft per min. We notified ATC that we had a pressurization problem and need lower quickly and we planned to return. We received initial clearance to 17,000' and then later to 13,000'. We descended at max rate. Our cabin altitude warning went off, we did our memory items, donned our O2 masks and turned back toward ZZZ airport. We declined to declare an emergency as our descent clearance came quickly and our cabin altitude never climbed above 11,000 ft, with 6 psi of pressure. At this point we went direct to the field and were given further step down altitudes as terrain allowed. We landed without further incident.		At 10,000 ft, the Flight Attendant in the front called up and said the door was very loud and Passengers were complaining. I could hear it through the intercom and it sounded like the door seal was not properly seated. We continued to climb and monitored the cabin pressure thinking the seal would be closed as the pressure in the cabin increased. The cabin pressure gauge showed a 6 psi pressure difference. However, the cabin was climbing at just under 1,000 ft per minute.We called ATC and asked for a level off, which we were given at Fl290. After we leveled, the cabin continued to climb, and we notified ATC that we needed to return. He gave us vectors, and as he was, we got the cabin altitude warning horn. We performed the memory items and I pulled out the checklist while the Captain started a decent, which we were given by ATC to 17,000 ft. At the time this was as low as we could get due to terrain. I did the checklist while the Captain flew, and by the time I got the Emergency Decent checklist, we were given clearance to 13,000 ft, and we continued down to that altitude. At this point we were direct to the field and given a few more step-downs until we reached 10,000 ft.		B737 flight crew is advised during climb by the A Flight Attendant that the forward cabin door has a loud hiss.  Approaching FL290 the crew requests a level off then a descent when the cabin continues to climb. The cabin altitude warning horn sounds as descent is commenced and the flight returns to departure airport.

The Captain looked at the ECAM and noticed one of the bleeds had gone away and pulled up the bleed page on the System Display.  I put down the books and turned my attention to the issue and noticed both engine bleeds had closed, both packs had shut down and the pneumatic cross bleed was closing.  The Captain called for Masks On and Emergency Descent Checklist. We had difficulty in communicating with ATC and so began our descent, turned the seat belt sign on, and finally got clearance to a lower altitude.  The Checklist was finished, we double checked the ECAM items, and called the Flight Attendants. During the descent between FL250 and about FL200, I reset the bleeds, the packs, and shut the pneumatic cross feed based on system knowledge.  The cabin started to stabilize somewhere around FL200-15000 ft, and was stable before reaching 10000 ft. The Captain was talking to Dispatch about a divert field and two options were offered.  He and I discussed both fields and we concluded that ZZZ would be better due to crew familiarity with the weather there and more recent operations. The flight continued with no further issues to ZZZ.				A320 First Officer at FL390 detects cabin pressure change and discovers both engine bleed valves have closed. The Captain initiates an emergency descent and the First Officer is able to reestablish bleeds and pack operation passing FL200. Flight crew elects to divert to a suitable alternate.

Noticed the right engine oil quantity at one quart while doing system checks after plotting position. Previously noticed oil quantities at 18 and 15 quarts. All other indications were normal. Shortly there after the quantity displayed zero with fluctuating oil pressure. I had recently completed transition training and recalled the anomaly to the oil quantity gauge (zero oil quantity indication 'good engine' scenario). We further referenced the flight manual engine chapter statement concerning oil quantity. We sent a message to Maintenance, Dispatch and the Flight Duty Manager. We wrote down the time and both engine parameters to chart them for trends. We sent additional messages to Maintenance inquiring maintenance history, servicing and oil usage. The reply revealed a normal history. We additionally inquired if our gauge readings were tied to EICAS. The flight manual engine shutdown, drift down/off track, mayday communications, divert options and approach considerations were reviewed. We elected to increase our speed as we were ahead of our fuel score by 2.8k. After speeding up the only change to engine parameters was a decrease in oil temperature by four degrees on both engines. We finally got the EICAS low oil pressure message. We shut down the engine, turned off track to the left as there was an Air Carrier flight at FL360 at our 4-5 o'clock and another aircraft at FL340 ahead of us. Mayday broadcasts were made with corresponding squawk. ATC datalink emergency and dispatch messages were sent. We descended to FL237 per the FMC and flew 10nm left of track. The alternate FMC page revealed that our destination and diversion airport were one minute apart in arrival time. We decided that the diversion airport was our most suitable divert field. When we were below the tracks we requested direct and were given the block FL200-240 and L/R 100 NM. Other aircraft offered assistance and a nearby aircraft relayed our requests to ATC. We politely declined the Coast Guard's escort. The Captain briefed the Purser and asked a pass traveling pilot to assist us in the cockpit. A cabin advisory was issued and emergency equipment was requested. We balanced fuel and got the winds, which were 020/7 gusts to 16 KTS and requested Runway XX. We decided further that if winds shifted east or gusts subsided we would switch to a different runway. The T-procedure also played into this decision. About 30 NM out the winds did shift and we changed runways. The single engine profile was uneventful and the autopilot was disconnected around 1,000 FT. It was a very nice approach and an uneventful landing and taxi to the gate. The emergency equipment request was canceled as we cleared the runway. Post flight the Captain debriefed the flight attendants and asked for their input on perception/reality and whether they needed or wanted anything different to accomplish their duties. I/we appreciated the pass riding pilot's courtesy in introducing himself before flight. He was a ready resource and we utilized his service with some radio calls and fuel system balancing.	The reporter stated that the oil pressure never dropped to zero before the engine was shut down. Maintenance determined that the air cooled oil cooler had developed a leak. The oil cooler was replaced, oil added and the flight continued.			A B777's oil cooler developed an oil leak in flight. After the EICAS 'LOW OIL PRESSURE' alerted, the engine was shutdown, an emergency declared and the flight diverted to an enroute airport.

A few minutes later Maintenance replied, 'Oil quantity is the least reliable of oil parameters. Check engine for oil use. Well within operating limits. Monitor oil press and oil temp. Keep us posted.' We then received a second message from Maintenance stating, 'have reviewed maintenance history, computer tracked oil usage. Both appear normal. Please monitor oil press and temp. Max continuous temp is 166c, min oil press 70 psi. If you get close to either, let us know and follow your Flight Manual'. The First Officer and I discussed if we should turn around and go back. Both of us felt that with the info from Maintenance it was an indication problem not a loss of oil. I was also under the impression that Maintenance would monitor our engine parameter and trends enroute via DATALINK and felt like they would have a clearer picture of what was happening with the engine. Enroute the oil quantity indication went to 0. We noted oil pressure and temp were normal and consistent with the left engine. We did notice that the right engine oil pressure was fluctuating a bit when compared to the left engine. We sent Maintenance and Dispatch these indications, including the fluctuating oil pressure on the right engine. We also included a question to Maintenance regarding when the EICAS message would come on for low oil quantity and if it was a direct read from the gauge. As time passed the First Officer and I noticed the oil pressure now was less than previously noted, still well in the normal operating range, oil temp was good, and engine vibration was consistent with the other engine. With the oil pressure decreasing we began to think this may be more than an indication problem, but didn't have enough info to make a complete decision. We sent Maintenance all indications noted, including oil pressure fluctuations and oil pressure decreasing slowly. We still had a good functioning engine, but felt like we needed to have dispatch get Operations involved and sent a message to dispatch requesting such. As we continued to the PET we received the following message from Maintenance, 'EICAS message at 70 PSI. Op transmitter is direct read to cockpit. There may be an input-output module effecting the oil qty. That is the only CMC MSG we currently see. Please enter log items for problems reported. Thanks for the help.' Still not sure of exactly what problem we had going on, my First Officer and I decided to come up with a plan of action if the engine quit or we had to shut it down. We still were under the impression it was probably an indication problem because of previous messages from Maintenance and we hadn't received any info from Maintenance to the contrary, the engine still had good oil pressure (even though it was still decreasing slowly), oil temp was normal, and there was no little or no vibration indicated. We felt like it was a good time to review all procedures pertinent to the situation, i.e. LO ENG OIL PRESS checklist in the Flight Manual, Drift down, Emergency section of the Chapter, etc. We reviewed the Eng Out page on the FMC CDU. We determined that if we needed to drift down we would need to initially turn left off the track because of the other aircraft on our track that were to our right at lower altitudes. We looked at what altitude to descend to and at what airspeed. We also reviewed emergency communications. As we approached the ETP we received this message from Maintenance, 'Originally you reported a problem with oil quantity indication. That is deferrable. Everything I have been able to look at suggests that is the problem. Now you are talking about oil press fluctuating. Is that correct?' My First Officer and I were a bit surprised by this question. First, we had always stated that the oil quantity indications were 1 quart or 0. We had never stated it was a problem with oil quantity indication. Second, we had sent at least a couple messages that the oil pressure was fluctuating. The only message to Maintenance that didn't contain that indication was the first message. At this point in time I believe we had passed the ETP. The right and left engines were performing normally, but we new there could very well be a problem. The oil press on #2 was still going down slowly (still within limits), the oil temp was good, and engine vibration was consistent with the other engine. My First Officer and I discussed the situation and decided to look at airports and weather. I stated that I felt like it would be better to divert to an airport with a long runway because we would be at Flaps 20 for single engine. We sent several messages to dispatch describing our intentions if we had to shut down the engine and requested info for [area airports]. After much discussion we decided that ZZZ would be the best divert airport because both of us had been into ZZZ within the last week. At that time I asked the Purser to come to the cockpit and briefed her. She was briefed about the situation, what it could become, and what our response would be. We advised her that we still were running on two engines but might have to shut the right engine down. We would descend down to a lower altitude and divert to ZZZ. About this same time we received this message from Maintenance, 'If pressure was steady and now with oil quantity zero, the pressure is starting to fluctuate, then there may be a problem with oil quantity, not an indication problem.  Follow your Flight Manual.'  I wished we had received this message a lot earlier, but now we new the problem and started to implement plans. The First Officer and I again went over our plan of action. We decided to wait until the EICAS message 'ENG LO OIL PRESS R' came on and then we would commence with shutting down the engine and starting the drift down procedure. I called the Purser and told her at some point we would probably shut the engine down and divert to ZZZ. I gave her an estimated time to ZZZ. I also said I would make an announcement, prior to shutting the engine down, to the passengers about what was going on were we would divert to and reassure them everything would be fine. [Later] the oil pressure on the right engine decreased to 70 PSI then back to 74 PSI. The EICAS message momentarily came on and went away. We decided to wait until we had a steady EICAS message before we would start the checklist. I made an announcement to the passenger as planned and briefed. Just a few minutes later we had a steady EICAS message, 'ENG LO OIL PRESS'. We proceeded with the checklist and shut the right engine down. We followed the drift down procedure, declared an emergency via CPDLC and over HF. We voiced 'MAYDAY, MAYDAY' over 123.45. We then turned on all exterior lights and exited the track to the left at the single engine drift down airspeed that was depicted on the CDU. Once we were 15 miles left of course we parallel the track using LNAV and continued the descent. We descended to our single engine operating altitude and asked ATC (via CPDLC) for direct ZZZ. Clearance was received and we were given a block altitude of FL200 to FL240.   During this time a Company First Officer that was riding in the back had the Purser call us up to ask if he could be any help. We had him come into the cockpit and assume a helpful role (This First Officer had come in prior to the flight and introduced himself and gave us his seat assignment). His help was appreciated. We briefed the approach; the single engine missed approach profile and the missed approach procedure. The approach was uneventful as well as the landing. We taxied off the runway and proceeded to the gate. I debriefed the Flight Attendant's after the flight to get their comments and thoughts.  Communication was the biggest problem and hindrance during the event. SATCOM voice was deferred inop. Prior to the flight ACARS did not work either and Maintenance was about to try and defer that as well. They finally got the ACARS to work before the flight departed. I'm not sure if I would take an aircraft over the ocean without either after this experience. As far as I'm concerned we did a good job with the information we had. The crew worked well with each other.   My First Officer brought the one mistake we made and were able to identify to my attention the day after the event. As we were boarding the crew van to go back to the airport for the deadhead back, the First Officer stated to me he had realized just that morning we had used the checklists out of the Flight Manual and not the Electronic Checklist (ECL). He had taken the checklists out of the Flight Manual binder and clipped it in the chart holder next to the side window. We had used these checklists for review during the event. When it came time to actually shut down the engine he read from those and not the ECL. I guess I was so caught up in shutting down an engine over the ocean and making sure I verified all the checklist items I didn't even notice. I have no idea of how I missed that and no excuses for it.				A B777 Captain reported low oil quantity on an overwater flight.  The engine was shut down when oil pressure fell below limits, an emergency was declared, and the flight diverted to the nearest suitable airport.

ATIS called the weather at 1700 SCT, 2500 BKN with 10 miles visibility.  As we approached the airport, we were vectored for the ILS 26 GS out.  As we descended to FAF altitude, we noticed that the weather was not as advertised on the ATIS so we quickly briefed the approach.  Everything was completed prior to the FAF and the aircraft was stabilized and ready to descend to the MDA.  As we passed the FAF, the pilot flying scrolled a vertical speed of 1200 fpm. As we approached 2500 feet on the altimeter, Tower advised us to check altitude - they had an Altitude Alert on us.  About 2 seconds later we get an Altitude Caution, followed by Terrain Caution Alert.  Since we did not have the airport in sight, we went around.  I am not sure why this happened.  We were established on the localizer; our altitude was well above the step-down fix as well as the MDA; our altimeter was correct; and our vertical speed was acceptable since we were well above 1000 ft AGL. I believe that ATC should have updated the weather sooner.  Our ATIS was the one being used even after our go-around.  ATIS Mike was 1 hour old when we were on approach.  The weather was not 1700 SCT with 10 miles.  If this weather was updated to current conditions, we would have switched roles to have the Captain flying since the actual weather was very close to the allowable limit that the First Officer can fly a non-precision approach per our FOM. But that clearly to me is NOT the reason we got the alerts.  We got the alert for some other reason than Pilot performance.		We are unsure of why we received the warnings on the Runway 26 approach and can only assume the system predicted a threat based on a 1500 fpm descent rate and the Tower's on final approach.		Air carrier on descent into PHX initiates a go around because of both an ATC and aircraft altitude alert during a non precision approach.

The Captain completed the ECAM procedure.  The only things that needed to be noted were performance items due to the gear doors down.  We had 3 green lights on the the ECAM display and on the Main Gear Panel.  We elected to land.  Upon landing and slowing below 60 knots the Captain assumed control of the aircraft.  The exit, M3, was to the left but the aircraft was veering to the right.  We stopped just short of the runway edge.  We notified Tower that we were disabled.  After coming to a complete stop and setting the parking park the Captain recycled the Nose Wheel/Anti Skid switch.  The steering system came back on and we were able to turn left and exit the runway.  We taxied to our gate, and notified Maintenance of the problem.  At no time did the aircraft ever leave the runway or paved surface.		I was Pilot Not Flying during this ILS in visual conditions. After gear extension we received ECAM's for 'L/G DOORS NOT CLOSED' and also for 'L/G UNSAFE'. I instructed the First Officer, who was Pilot Flying, to continue the approach while I analyzed the situation. We had three green gear down indications on the landing gear panel from the LGCIU 1 [Landing Gear Control Interface Unit], and the corresponding down indications on lower ECAM. However the background gear indications showed an unsafe nose landing gear. Additionally, the gear doors appeared to be hanging for both the mains and the nose, and this was corroborated by the First Officer, who was having to carry more power than is usual for the approach, which was now well below 1000 feet. We engaged in a brief discussion of the situation, and elected to continue the approach to a landing. This was done with the assurance from the LGCIU 1 that the gear were, in fact, down and locked, and also with the recent Newark incident in mind and doubts as to gear door sequencing, had we elected to cycle the gear. I also elected to 'emergency cancel' a subsequent Level 3 ECAM for gear not down at 750 feet. The landing was smooth and uneventful until the First Officer offered up the airplane to me while adding, 'I don't think we have steering'. Not only did we not have steering but the aircraft pulled moderately to the right after it decelerated below 70 knots, and it was all that I could do to keep it on the paved surface of the runway abeam taxiway Mike 3. I brought the aircraft to a stop and set the parking brake while instructing the Tower to tell following aircraft to go around. I was acutely aware that the Tower had already cleared us to exit Mike 3 and contact Ground Control, had also cleared an aircraft behind us to land, and I was extremely worried about our position on the runway and our lack of visibility in this night operation. I then cycled the anti skid and nose gear steering switch and everything returned to normal, and we were able to taxi to the gate uneventfully, considering our proximity to the right runway edge. In retrospect, I think it is clear that the better option would have been to go around and sort out the situation airborne with the assistance of the checklists and possibly of Maintenance Control, but it should be pointed out that the maintenance personnel who met the airplane characterized the situation as 'really messed up'. I have had LGCIU failures before, and this just did not seem like the garden variety failure.		A320 flight crew reports ECAM message L/G DOORS NOT CLOSED and L/G UNSAFE after gear extension during approach. Two other indications are that the gear is safe so approach is continued to landing. During roll out the nose wheel steering is discovered to be inoperative causing the following aircraft to go around.

At this point we tried recycling the flaps from two to one and back to two to try and correct the problem.  The leading edge devices moved normally but the trailing flaps remained up, with an amber indication.  At this point we discontinued the approach and asked for vectors to work the problem.  The copilot flew and worked the radio while I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control via ACARS.  I made an announcement to the passengers.  With Dispatch and Maintenance on the radio we went over the problem and tried cycling the flaps again with no fix.  Maintenance Control said there was no way to correct the problem and we went over correct approach procedures.  At this point I had the First Officer declare an emergency.  The First Officer and I decided to have the cabin prepped for an evacuation due to the unusual approach, high speeds, possible tail strike, blown tires, hot brakes, etc.  The Flight Attendants were notified, and I made another announcement to the passengers.  We briefed the approach, with all the additional items and proper VREF which we calculated to be 158kts.  On downwind to base I became pilot flying. The approach and landing to XXR, was uneventful.  Brace was called for at 500 feet, and we told everybody to remain seated as we slowed to taxi speed.  The landing roll and braking effort was a little more than normal and we saw no problem to continue to the gate.		The initial response was for the First Officer to continue as pilot flying, and talk to ATC, and the Captain would handle the ECAM. The approach was continued, gear was lowered passing the FAF and one attempt was made to recycle the flaps. At approximately 1600' a decision was made to go-around in the current configuration, and a climb to 2000' and then to 5000' was coordinated with ATC.		An A320 flight crew declared an emergency and landed safely after the flaps failed to extend normally.

As we were on the takeoff roll, the Captain and I noticed a burning smell, I made my 80 KTS call out, and we then received a takeoff configuration warning.

We were on a left base at flaps 1. While turning final outside of the final approach fix, Captain is slowing and calls for gear down and flaps 2. After I move the flap lever to the flaps 2 position, we get a F/CTL Flaps Locked-Alignment Fault ECAM on the upper ECAM. Following the ECAM, I tried to raise the flaps back to flaps 1. The ECAM remained and the flaps were locked. The Captain and I agreed that we needed to break off the approach. I told the Tower Controller that we had a flight control problem and needed to break off the approach. He gave us a heading to fly and gave us an altitude of 6,000. I told him we needed to go hold while we worked through the problem. Captain remained in control of the airplane and took ATC while I got the Flight Manual out and I work through the procedures of the ECAM. After determining our landing configuration, approach speed, and landing distance I got a patch to Maintenance Control to get any additional input. Maintenance Control said follow the flight manual procedures. At this point the Captain reviewed the landing chart in the maneuvers section with abnormal flaps. We were now ready to return to land. This took about 10-15 minutes. I advised ATC that we are declaring an Emergency and would like to return to Runaway XXR and we would like the emergency equipment standing by. The Captain made a very nice approach and landing on Runway XXR. The Captain made several PA's to the passengers throughout this event and the Flight Attendants did a cabin advisory. After landing on Runway XXR, we exited and set the brakes. The emergency folks inspected the airplane and we were cleared to taxi to gate.				An A320 crew reported an ECAM alerting F/CTL Flaps Locked-Alignment Fault. After following ECAM and Flight Manual procedures, an emergency was declare and the Captain landed on the longest available runway.

We crossed the IAF at 250 KTS with flaps up and gear up. Throttles appeared to be at idle. At the 1,000 FT automated callout of the configuration was 'Gear Down and Flaps 15.' As the pilot not flying, I called out 'Configuration.' Aircraft was decelerating and flaps extended. I called 'Before landing checklist complete,' as the aircraft finally got in landing configuration well below 1,000 FT. My lack of assertiveness was, in my opinion, contributed by fatigue after a long oceanic flight. I should have called 'Go-Around,' instead of 'Configuration.'		From the second observer jumpseat many of the subsequent flight parameters were difficult to see or monitor, however the throttles appeared to be at idle (from my view point) from the final approach fix until the command for Flaps 30. At the automated 1,000 FT callout, the configuration of the aircraft was gear down, Flaps 15 as monitored by the verbal instructions of the pilot flying. The First Officer called out 'CONFIGURATION' with no apparent reaction from the pilot flying the aircraft. Lacking a response, this First Officer should have announced 'Go Around.' Sometime after the automated 500 FT callout, the command for Flaps 30 was made from the Flaps 20 position, again as monitored by the verbal instructions of the pilot flying. The throttles were advanced as the landing checklist was announced complete, and was immediately followed by the automated minimums callout (200 FT AGL). A normal landing followed.		A B777 flight crew reported descending below 1,000 FT not in a landing configuration. The First Officer's callout did not alert the Captain about the improper configuration and a go-around callout was not made. The aircraft was properly configured at 500 FT.

We were given a clearance by New York Center to proceed direct to SKPPR. The point was on our flight plan and in the FMS database but we couldn't find it on our enroute chart. We eventually figured out with the assistance of Dispatch that the point was in the chart NOTAM in the front of Part II. During the flight we were using Latin American High/Low chart 5/6 and 7/8. Both pilots had thoroughly reviewed both charts and were actively discussing different features of the chart. When we determined the compulsory reporting points, we both failed to notice that VESRA is listed as a non compulsory on the high 5/6 but as a compulsory reporting on the high 7/8. We crossed VESRA and failed to accomplish a position report until we noticed the difference in the charts as we approached the point MACOR and had crossed onto the airspace covered by LA 7/8. ZNY did not notify us of missing the position report. At MACOR we notified ZNY of our mistake and accomplished the VESRA position report. I believe both of these events illustrate an area that could be improved. The information and preflight duties that are required by our crews make it very difficult to review all the information that would have allowed us to catch both of these chart issues. It would be a lot more effective if any changes have been made to the flights' planned route that they be listed on the F-4 NOTAM or some other easy to find location. The conflict between the two charts also needs to be corrected. I also think it would be easy and a great back up for crews if the compulsory reporting points would be highlighted on the flight plan in some way to show them as such.		Flight planned on L455 SKPPR to LENNT. On chart LA 5/6, effective 10/09, VESRA is not shown as a mandatory reporting point. Points UMEDA and ULEMO were changed to SKPPR and MCOOP in the chart NOTAMS appropriately. There was no chart NOTAM about VERSA changing from a non-mandatory reporting point to a reporting point. As we later referred to LA 7/8, dated 2/10, VERSA shows as a mandatory reporting point. Approaching MACOR questioned ZNY about this discrepancy and passed on our time and fuel over VESRA. We were never sel called or asked for an estimate over VESRA by ZNY. I feel it would be helpful and appropriate that changes along our flight plan be showed as an F-4 such as the change to SKPPR and MCOOP without having to reference chart NOTAM's. I also feel VESRA should have been shown in the chart NOTAMS as changing from a non-mandatory to a mandatory reporting point.		B737 flight crew laments fix name changes along Airway L455, which which are only to be found in chart NOTAMS. Fix VESRA is not included in the NOTAM's but has been changed to a compulsory reporting point on one High Chart but not on the other which overlaps.

Since we were still in the pattern, we decided to stay low and complete the QRH checklist and determine whether we should continue the departure.  Ran the checklist and could not determine whether the jet was pressurizing normally, so rather than take a risk with something that could go very wrong at altitude (masks/cabin mask jungle/emergency descent, etc.), we decided to err on the side of caution and land the jet to have the door checked by maintenance.  As it turned out, the door was slightly open and there was a strap caught between the door and the sensor that was preventing the door from closing properly.		It took me longer than I would have liked to find the appropriate checklist. I looked for 'Cabin Door' vs 'Door' light in the index.I strongly recommend that all QRH checklists be indexed by any possible means (i.e. 'DOOR,' 'CARGO DOOR,' 'AFT CARGO DOOR' all point to the checklist). I do not look at the cabin pressure gauge below the 10,000 check absent some need to. As a result, I was not as clear as I should be on what 'normal' [differential pressure ]looks like at 2000 feet.'		A B737-700 returned to the departure airport when an Aft Cargo Door warning light illuminated and the status of pressurization was uncertain.

FMS did not autoload and was manually loaded by First Officer. I read back both the route and legs from the FMS while the First Officer compared to the flight plan. After passing an enroute waypoint correctly, the aircraft flew to the next waypoint in the FMS: KDXYU. Approximately 10 minutes later, Center asked us to verify we were going to KDYXU. The active waypoint was KDXYU and upon looking at the flight plan, the error was obvious. Controller stated we could go to either waypoint and we elected to go to the correct waypoint: KDYXU. No traffic conflicts were mentioned and the rest of the flight was uneventful. We didn't have a lot of time between flights and this also involved an aircraft change. Human error was introduced when the FMS didn't autoload and was not caught during route/leg verification. Dyslexia is live and well! More attention to detail was/is needed during the route/leg verification especially when the alpha/numeric waypoints are used.		We had just come in late and had to enter an already boarded aircraft. The route, which normally automatically uploads, did not upload.		A B737 crew reported that they manually entered and verified an alphanumeric flight plan routing after it did not automatically load. Because of a quick turn around, a transposition error in a waypoint entry was not seen and an enroute track deviation resulted.

We placed the gear handle in the down position, gear came down, but we were left with the L/G Not Uplocked ECAM.  We advised ATC of our situation and proceeded to hold. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to advise of our condition.  It appeared the L/G doors were closed. We coordinated with Tower to do a low approach and confirm gear down and locked and a controllability check.  During the approach we selected full flaps and got excessive vibration.  We retracted the flaps back to position 3, where the vibration ceased and the low approach confirmed 3 gear extended.  We flew an uneventful flaps 3 landing with minimum sink rate on landing, as requested by Maintenance.

Thunderstorms and icing were active in the area. Radar was on and aircraft was on a clear flight path in smooth air. Flight was running late so a modified climb speed of 310 was being used and a final altitude of 24,000 FT was requested from ATC due to a short leg length. Climbing through 18,000 FT both altimeters were switched to STD, autopilot was engaged at this time and lights were secured. At approximately 19,000 FT in the climb the pitch bar on the PFD disappeared and the aircraft pitched over hard from approximately seven degrees nose up to five degrees nose down. I disengaged the autopilot and auto throttles and slowly brought the deck angle back into a climb attitude. No column entanglement was apparent. No warning lights or messages were present. Windshield, pitot heat and engine anti-ice were ON and icing was present on the wipers. Aircraft increased in speed very rapidly and mach clacker sounded at 325 KTS during pull and recovery. Aircraft was returned to flight path and a slower airspeed used. Flight Attendants were not injured, felt like a hard level off. Maintenance was informed of problem and met the aircraft on jet bridge. Long and descriptive log book entry was completed by Captain. Mechanic was debriefed and after an hour, called the Captain with preliminary information. Two faults were found. An altitude discrepancy was found as a hard fault and a right ADIRU fault was indicated. His opinion was icing of the right pitot. Again heat was ON and no fault was indicated. Issues: Deviation from ATC clearance during pitch over and subsequent recovery. Aircraft exceeded VMMO during recovery by about 5 KTS.	The reporter described very clearly the sequence of events before and during the pitch over. He has a set pattern of actions at FL180 that include stating '29.92', setting the altimeter, engaging the number two autopilot, turning the landing lights off and checking the pressurization. The reporter typically hand flies the aircraft to FL180 in order to maintain flying proficiency. During this flight the aircraft was in VNAV SPD at 300 KTS. At FL190 the aircraft began a firm but not violent pitch over to five degrees nose down. The total altitude loss was 4,000'. Upon arrival at the next airport the crew talked with Maintenance about the event and put the detailed report in the maintenance log. The Mechanic found two faults listed on the E and E Compartment boxes but neither explained the aircraft's action. Both the crew and aircraft overnighted. The aircraft was released for an on time departure the next morning. Days later the crew was told that it was determined that the crew did not set their altimeters within five seconds of each other and therefore the autopilot was attempting to resolve the discrepancy between them. The Reporter questioned this statement because he has never heard nor seen anything in writing which would verify that assertion. The flight conditions at the time were smooth although earlier in the climb the aircraft transited some rough air with icing. The reporter questioned if possibly ice had accumulated on the tail causing loss of tail airflow. The other ice related question he had was if the aircraft's pitot system was iced over by the earlier icing and just momentarily responded as the ice melted. The air data computer could also be called into question.			A B737-800 pilot reported a pitch over climbing to FL190 resulting in a 4,000' altitude loss. Maintenance reported an ADIRU fault with an altitude fault.

No flap exceedences observed. VMC by 1000 FT. Airspeed fluctuations diminishing. Approach missed Tower handoff (high workload). Tower gave green light, no time for voice landing clearance. Auto throttle had difficulty keeping up, overrode auto throttle and flew what would have been manual throttle approach speed. Had 13,000 feet of runway, light aircraft and knew I had deteriorating weather aloft. Maintained positive aircraft control throughout short final, flare and touchdown.		Given a shorter than anticipated turn to final due to rain showers in the vicinity with a tailwind on final above 2000 FT. High on final, we elected to perform a go-around at 1500 FT and vectored for a second approach to Runway 09. Opted for twenty five flaps because of gusty winds. Winds and turbulence diminished by 1000 FT and we had a stable approach with slightly increased airspeed due to gusts. Approach Controller was very busy and we did not get a switch to Tower until we asked at 1000 FT. Tower frequency was busy until our touchdown and we were unable to get a verbal landing clearance, but Tower indicated we had a green light. We did not observe any flap over-speed on approach, go-around or second approach despite erratic winds, airspeed and turbulence above 1000 FT.		A B777 flight crew reported a missed approach due to being high and a subsequent successful approach as heavy weather approached from the west at MIA.

The aircraft was in VNAV PTH for approximately 1 minute when it started an uncommanded descent in VNAV PTH. Several seconds later, VNAV disengaged and CWS P engaged. I disconnected the autopilot and manually flew the aircraft back to FL380 from FL375. Center called and asked if we had switched our altimeter to 29.92 since there was a 250 FT altitude difference. I explained the problem and stated that we were climbing back to FL380. Our gross weight was approximately 138,000 LBS. The optimum altitude on the ACT ECON CRZ page was FL380 and maximum was FL400 so we were unable to determine the reason for the uncommanded descent. There were no further problems with the VNAV during the flight.	The Reporter stated that the autopilot disconnect warning did not alert and the autopilot remained engaged. It responded as if it were commanded to begin a descent and transition to CWP P. The FMC software version was U 10.6 the reporter believed to best of his recollection. He has been on this aircraft five years and not seen anything like it. The old FMC software, 10.8 was causing database issues and allowed dual FMC failures to occur and not permit resets. The anomaly reported here is not something that was seen when U 10.8 was installed.	Shortly after level off at FL380, autopilot on, VNAV engaged and 38,000 FT set in MCP altitude window, aircraft reduced power and began to descend. We stopped the descent after 250 FT and returned to assigned altitude.		A B737-800 Crew reported that in level flight at FL380 with the autopilot in VNAV Path the aircraft began an uncommanded descent. The autopilot disconnected and transitioned to CWP P.

I made a mental note of it and decided I would rebalance the tanks at cruise when a more accurate reading could be taken. A few minutes later, the First Officer called my attention to the #1 main fuel gauge, which had just turned amber with an imbalance indication.  At that point we performed the Fuel Imbalance checklist.  The fuel quantity continued to decrease in the #1 tank, and we asked the Flight Attendants to see if they could observe any fuel streaming from the port side of the aircraft.  They could not see any leaks.  Our total fuel quantity shown on the FMC supported what we saw on the gauges, and the #1 quantity continued to decrease.  At that point the QRH directed us to the Fuel Leak checklist.  After completing it, and based on the still decreasing fuel quantity, we had to assume we were experiencing an actual fuel leak.  The QRH directed us to the Engine Shutdown and Single Engine Landing checklist.  We declared an emergency with ATC and shutdown the #1 engine as we descended back to our departure airport.  We made an uneventful single-engine landing and returned to the gate after the Fire Marshall confirmed no observable fuel leaking from the aircraft.  Our jumpseater also ran the numbers for the flaps 15 return and advised us that there would be no brake cooling issues.  After returning to the gate, we advised Dispatch and debriefed the event with the Chief Pilot on Call.		During climbout, the Captain noticed a 400 lb split at 10,000' between the left fuel tank and the right fuel tank. Passing FL230, the fuel imbalance increased to 1500 lbs with the left fuel tank steadily decreasing. We declared an emergency with ATC and then coordinated right turn direct to ZZZ. We ran the QRH checklist for a fuel imbalance then fuel leak. The QRH directed us to the Engine Shutdown checklist once we concluded we had a possible fuel leak. We continued the Engine Shutdown checklist including Single Engine Landing checklist.We landed on 1R with variable winds. After landing, we coordinated with ATC and the Emergency Crews to visually check if fuel was leaking from the left side. No fuel leaks were observed so we taxied single engine to the gate.		B737-700 flight crew experiences a fuel imbalance shortly after takeoff which exceeds limitations passing FL230. The engine is shut down in accordance with QRH fuel leak procedures and flight returns to departure airport.

He had passed us a little earlier, and while we were offset one mile to the right, he was right on the airway. The wind had been a slight right crosswind, which changed to a direct tailwind. The offset assured that we stayed well right of his wake. As the preceding aircraft was approximately 15 miles ahead of us, the wind changed to a slight left crosswind, causing us to encounter his wake turbulence.  We immediately turned left, removing the offset, and the turbulence ceased, having lasted approximately 30 seconds.  The seatbelt sign was turned on during the encounter. Our crew rest started right after the encounter, and as I entered the cabin, I was informed by another crewmember, that a flight attendant in the back of the airplane had been injured. I went back to the aft galley, where I found her sitting on the floor, in obvious pain, with an ice pack on her right shoulder.  I asked her if there was anything I could do to help her and offered to have paramedics meet the airplane. She did not feel that was necessary, but later on asked for a flight attendant supervisor to meet the airplane. We sent a message to the station with that request, and were surprised to find that nobody met the airplane. I again spoke with the injured Flight Attendant as we left the airplane, and while she seemed to be doing a lot better, she still appeared to be in pain when moving her shoulder.				A B777 encountered wake turbulence from a preceding B747-400 a thousand feet above them in the mid Pacific.

Tower handed us off to Chicago Center.  Approaching 8000 FT we were cleared for a higher altitude.  Then we received a TA alert and at the same time ATC notified us of traffic at one thirty, all of this happened simultaneously and both the First Officer and I visually saw the other aircraft then we received an RA; 'Descend Now, Descend Now'.  At that moment, I simultaneously manually pulled the power back to flight idle and pushed the nose over and turned to the right while descending and maintaining visual contract with the intruding small aircraft.  As to how close we were is unknown.  I can tell you that it was a Cessna RG white with red and black trim.  I could also see the N-numbers and the two pilots.  ATC was not talking to the intruding small aircraft and that Aircraft was operating under VFR Rule.  Vigilance when operating less than 10000 FT in VFR conditions is a must.  Automation and so called 'Smart Aircraft' like our 737NG aircraft are a great asset to us and to the safety of Flight Crew and passengers.  We as pilots have to remember that there are other pilots and small aircraft that still fly under VFR rules and they also have a right to use the airspace all so.  Our 737NG aircraft are TCAS equipped and it's a great tool.  We also have a window to look out of also.  In this RA event, I used the automation and in addition was able to hand fly the aircraft while maintaining visual contact and a safe distance thus avoiding the intruding small aircraft.				A B737NG Captain reported an airborne conflict that resulted in a TCAS RA and the advantage that TCAS offers. He also stressed the need for traffic vigilance below 10,000 FT.

We decided the best action was to execute a go around, climb to a safe altitude, determine what further actions to take and configure the aircraft for landing. The go around was accomplished normally with the flaps retracting normally and the flap position indicator always agreeing with the flaps selected. After reaching a safe altitude and reading the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree QRH, we determined that it did not apply to our situation because the flaps retracted normally on go around and the flap position indicator agreed with the flaps selected. We asked for a vector back to the airport and the aircraft configured normally with the flap position indicator always agreeing with the selected flap position. We executed a normal landing without further issues.				B737-800 Captain experienced trailing edge flap disagree during approach and goes around. Flaps retracted normally then extend normally on the next approach.

This continued to 10,000 feet and during stable unaccelerated flight.  We were both uncomfortable with the unusual trim motion, so decided to run the checklist, contact Maintenance, Dispatch, and decided to return.  Being a flight control issue and needing to land flaps 15 per the checklist we determined declaring an emergency was the correct course of action.  During vectors as an emergency aircraft we were vectored into close proximity of a general aviation aircraft at 5,000 feet, thus receiving and complying with an RA.  We landed uneventfully and parked at the gate.		On climbout we both noticed pitch trim wheel movement in a non-normal manner. We discussed it and monitored it. It continued during the climb to 10,000 feet, so we made the turn into the downwind. We ran the Stabilizer Trim Inop checklist and contacted Dispatch. After talking to Dispatch and Maintenance Control we decided to return.  I had Dispatch run a flaps 15 landing distance. It was not an overweight landing. We completed all checklists and made a return with an uneventful landing. Also while ATC was vectoring us to the west at 5000 feet a light aircraft with 500 feet of separation gave us an RA, which we complied with to satisfy. We had the aircraft in sight also.		B737-700 flight crew experiences abnormal trim wheel movements during climbout and elects to return after declaring an emergency and complying with QRH procedures. During the return a TCAS RA is received and complied with before an uneventful landing.

After traffic conflict was clear we were recleared to 21000 FT. Somewhere between 8-9000 FT, we got a Oil Filter Bypass light. MSA for that area was around 11000 FT so while Captain started looking at the QRH, I kept the aircraft climbing to 12000 for obstacle clearance. We declared an emergency and started a turn back to the airport. Followed QRC procedures for Oil Filter Bypass light, which eventually had us shut down the #1 engine. Made a normal single engine approach to Runway.		Passing approximately 11000 MSL on climbout number one engine Oil Filter Bypass alert illuminated.

Flight Attendants were up and serving. I contacted the Flight Attendants after the turbulence event and asked if they were OK.  They stated they thought they were OK, but were shaken up.  Encountered moderate turbulence in descent and executed ILS approach to minimums. After shutdown at gate, my First Officer asked if the aircraft required a writeup.  I stated, 'I don't think so.' At this time I opened the cabin door and found out that two of the Flight Attendants did in fact receive injuries during the turbulence.  I got caught up in assessing the Flight Attendants' injuries.  The Flight Attendants ultimately determined they did not need emergency medical care and we proceeded to the hotel.  After arrival at the hotel, I replayed the event in my head to see if I had covered all the bases.  I then remembered the First Officer asking about the logbook writeup. I referenced the FOM and could not find anywhere that it stated to make the writeup. I only found out that I had not completed the appropriate logbook entry when the Assistant Chief Pilot called me this morning.  He stated that it even took him 'some digging' to find were it directed to make the logbook entry.  An appropriate corrective action would be to amend the FOM to direct the reader to information regarding incident and accident reporting.		After we deplaned the Passengers, I performed a thorough walkaround of the aircraft to look for possible damage. No abnormalities were found. When I returned to the aircraft cabin, I discovered that one of our three Flight Attendants had a swollen ankle injury that occurred during the turbulence encounter. Once at the hotel I opened my FOM to the severe turbulence index tab to see if I could find specific reference to inspection requirements. Under severe turbulence, there were three reference pages listed. None of these pages directed the need for an inspection following a severe turbulence encounter.  Rather, the inspection requirement information was contained under generic notification chapters in a sub-section containing definitions for turbulence intensity.		A B737-700 Captain failed to write up a severe turbulence encounter during which two flight attendants suffered minor injuries.

The pilot flying was cleared to descend to 2,500 from 3,500, given a vector to intercept the final approach course and cleared for the approach.  During the right turn to intercept at approximately 2,800 FT, the aircraft pitched up to approximately 15 degrees nose high and the airspeed rapidly decreased to the boxed airspeed of approximately 115 KTS.  The pilot flying asked the pilot monitoring to select Flaps 15 just prior to this occurrence as he was slowing down and configuring the aircraft.  The pilot flying had the autothrottles engaged using the level change function to descend from 3,500 to 2,500.  The throttles were flight idle and airspeed was Flaps 5 airspeed on the bug.  The pilot flying was using the heading select feature for the intercept and I believe he selected the APP mode as well.  It is my belief the autopilot captured the glideslope and was trying to initiate a climb to intercept, and the auto throttles added power for the climb but not quickly enough and thus the rapid loss of airspeed.  If this is actually what occurred, then it needs to be made known how the aircraft will respond with autothrottles engaged and an intercept below glideslope.				While intercepting the localizer, a B737-700 experienced uncommanded pitch and autothrottle anomalies.  The event was apparently related to the inappropriate capture of the glideslope from below and a short lived low airspeed deviation ensued.

I immediately noted the maneuvering speeds appear on the MASI [Mach Air Speed Indicator] which led me to believe all was normal, but I did not initially check the flap gauge. As we continued to slow, we received a momentary stall warning and the First Officer executed the stall recovery. We then noticed that the flaps were still indicating zero. I informed Tower that we were going around, that we had a flap problem, and needed time to figure it out. As we climbed from 2500' to assigned missed approach altitude of 3000 feet, we overshot the altitude and informed ATC. We were vectored for a downwind to give us time to take care of the problem. My concerns at this point were fuel, weather, and runway length and condition if we had to land no flap. The First Officer continued to fly while I talked to ATC, checked performance data, and ran the appropriate checklists. We got vectors to a downwind and I checked for landing data which indicated we could land with no flaps if we had to. I then referenced the QRH for Flaps, Trailing Edge: Symmetrical Non-Normal/No Flap. We ran the checklist and extended the flaps with the alternate flap switch. We then were vectored back to the ILS and I made a flap 15 landing with autobrake set to max.  We accomplished all of the above in a short time due to the amount of fuel onboard and the need to not delay our landing. We made one quick call to the Flight Attendants to let them know we were still landing at destination, but did not have time to give any detail or make a PA to the passengers. After arriving at the gate, I talked to Dispatch and Maintenance to arrange for repairs. Maintenance informed me that the same thing had happened to that aircraft only three days before. They requested that I try to raise the flaps at the gate which I did normally with the flap handle. I then tried to lower the flaps normally and the normal system worked.		Rain/visibility made visual inspection of leading edge devices from cockpit impossible.I assumed MASI speed bugs illuminated on PFD meant flaps had correctly deployed. I assumed flap gauge/needles inop. [This event taught me] MASI bugs reflect flap handle position only.		A B737-700 Flight Crew encountered a failure of the flaps to extend when they got a stick shaker warning at maneuvering speed for flaps five.

The Captain had the aircraft in heading select, with approach mode armed.  The correct frequency was tuned and identified.  We were level at 2,500 MSL and configuring for the approach.  Autopilot and autothrottles were engaged.  Captain called for flaps 15.  I responded with flaps 15, and moved the flap handle to the 15 detent.  Captain then selected flaps 15 maneuvering speed on the MCP.  As he did so, the autopilot pitched the aircraft up, and started a climbing right turn.  The airspeed bled off rapidly.We had a Company Captain in the jumpseat.  He was the first to call out airspeed.  The Captain then disconnected the autopilot and corrected the attitude.  As his hand went down to the thrust levers, the autothrottles finally responded appropriately to the condition, they advanced toward max thrust.  After Captain had corrected the attitude, he then disconnected the autothrottles and hand flew the remainder of the approach.  The maximum altitude I saw was 3,300 MSL, and the minimum airspeed I saw was 126 knots. Unfortunately, I am uncertain as to what the FMA annunciations were at that point; the MASI (Mach Airspeed Indicator) and ADI had my full attention at that time.  After much discussion with Captain and the Captain in the jumpseat, we were unable to ascertain exactly why the autopilot and autothrottles responded the way they did.				A B737-700 flight crew on vectors to intercept and ILS was surprised when the autopilot commanded a right turn and pitched up while the autothrottles failed to advance to maintain programmed airspeed.

We told ATC our intentions and got a route for ZZZ.  The Captain than briefed the Purser of the situation, and gave them a time until landing and nature of problem. We had an uneventful approach and landing.  The fire trucks were waiting and we cleared the runway and had them do a visual on the gear and brakes.  After a thumbs up from them we continued the gate.  The braking system was normal brakes and the accumulator was fully charged, but we had the ramp chock all wheels.

I notified ATC that we possibly lost a backup computer that provides navigational and flight control information. I then notified Dispatch through ACARS and requested maintenance at our destination. The First Officer was the Flying Pilot. On a 10 mile final, the First Officer lost his flight director display. He then transferred the controls to me as the flying pilot since I had a full display of information. Landing was normal. The QRH was of little help for this event.

SOCAL cleared us for the RIIVR 2 and ILS 24R.  I think the controller heard hesitation on the read back and she offered that when we got closer in they may be able to change us to the ILS 25L.  Captain responded that we just had to re-enter and re-check it all.  Closer in the controller had a conflict developing and he canceled our approach clearance for ILS 24R and gave us a heading and clearance for the ILS 25L.  He gave us a clearance from 7000 to 2500 and asked us to expedite through 4000.  He noted he was trying to get us down and would have a plane over the top of us.  Controller noted that the speed assignment and low altitude would take us below the BRAVO airspace and then we would be back in the Bravo airspace.  I know that LAX used to pursue certificate action for inadvertent deviations below the Bravo airspace.  Since we were under SOCAL control vectors and assigned speeds I assume this is not an issue.				Air carrier inbound to LAX described an excursion from Class B because of an ATC assigned altitude.

We had brought the same aircraft in the night before and were hoping the hi-stage valve would get fixed but it didn't happen. MEL stated that in icing conditions the power must be kept at 60% N1 to keep engine and/or wing heat operative. The first leg was uneventful. At predeparture weather for CYYZ was something like 7 degrees overcast. We took the plane not worried about icing conditions and the engine write-up. Fast forward -- approaching CYYZ, approach changed the landing runway from 24R to 05 as we were descending through 20,000 FT. We were on the WATERLOO 2 Arrival and were given clearance to cross ROKTO at 7,000 FT and the aircraft began to ice up. Engine and wing heat were applied. Throttles had to be kept at 60% N1 per MEL. Even with the speed brake fully extended throughout the descent there was no way we were going to make the ROKTO restriction and I told the Controller as much. 'No problem,' we took a turn to the northwest to allow room to descend but it was still a struggle to keep the power up and descend and slow especially at 10,000 FT. Still in icing conditions -- I would call it light to moderate rime. Continued the descent to the field, still in icing conditions and power is still at 60% for deicing. Cleared for the approach to Runway 05 at about 4,000 FT began configuring very early to help slow the airplane with power on for continued icing-speed brakes still out. Very close to flap overspeed limits, but we did not overspeed. Speed brake being manipulated to keep the aircraft slowing with throttles still up for icing. Two dots above the glideslope at about 2,500 FT the Controller asks if we were going to be able to get down. We answered yes, we'd like to continue. Started to break out at about 1,500 FT throttles immediately pulled back by pilot flying (First Officer) and we were pretty close to being stabilized and on glideslope at 1,000 FT VMC and stabilized at 500 FT. Landing was uneventful. With 20/20 hindsight, I would not have accepted the aircraft for the CYYZ leg. Lesson learned -- look at weather and aircraft MEL limitations closely -- if in doubt don't accept the aircraft until it gets fixed! Nice airmanship by First Officer into the field under less than ideal circumstances.				A B737-800 Captain described an approach to CYYZ in icing condition with an engine high pressure bleed blocked closed. To allowing anti-ing 60% N1 was required which made the IMC approach challenging because speed control was a problem.

At rotation we felt a small vibration/shimmy, I thought perhaps due to a gust of wind.  We took off and began the normal climb out sequence.  After raising the gear, we noticed a red light and green light in the gear indicator system.  We continued our clean up and got a vector south and climb to 7000' MSL.  The pilot monitoring got the QRH out and looked for a checklist for our situation.  We still had good hydraulics at this time.  I stated the right main was still down per the green lights and the red light was on due to the gear handle being up and the gear being down.  We noticed the A system hydraulic quantity decreasing and eventually go to zero.  We ran that checklist and coordinated with Dispatch and the Chief Pilots.  We elected to do a fly by for the Tower and they confirmed a blown number 3 tire, number 4 looked good.  After further consultation, we elected to do an overweight landing 131,000 lbs considering crosswind, weight, stopping ability, and only one main on the right side.  The Captain elected to make the landing.  Upon landing the HYD annunciator flickered and I noticed the B system quantity at zero and rising.  We slowed near an available exit and the system was at 45%.  Tower asked our intentions and we cleared at there and told them we were developing a dual hydraulic system fail and would stop in place.  Fire met us.  We shut down the engines, had it chocked and were towed back to the gate.				A blown tire on takeoff was followed by a complete A Hydraulic System failure for a B737-700 flight crew.

Pilot flying hit Level Change button and set speed 290 KTS. At reaching PECOX, pilot flying noted aircraft didn't level off for crossing restriction and continued to descend. He verbally stated this, disconnected automation, and climbed back to the assigned altitude. While the pilot flying noted and corrected the problem, a 400 FT low deviation occurred. The total time of deviation was approximately 20 seconds. Upon returning to altitude, we realized that the error occurred because the aircraft was not in VNAV Descent mode but the Level Change mode. The pilot flying should have hit speed intervention instead of level change. The pilot monitoring should have ensured proper monitoring of ATC directed changes and the impacts of MCP selection, i.e. ensuring proper MCP mode is selected.				A B737NG failed to make a crossing restriction on the SEAVU STAR when the pilot flying selected Level Change instead of Speed Intervention when given a speed restriction by ATC.

This took us to the west several miles and Approach then vectored us back toward the field.  Approach changed the runway expectation to 34R.  We were then advised the field would be switching to a south flow and we were the last to land north.  We acknowledged and called the field in sight.  Approach subsequently cleared us for the visual to 34R.  We configured, switched to Tower, and reported left downwind for left base to 34R.  We met stabilized approach criteria and completed the Before Landing checklist.  At this time, Tower asked if they could shut the ILS down since they were switching.  Although familiar with the field and willing to help out ATC when possible, I requested the First Officer ask to have it left on at least until we rolled out on final.  I wanted to use all available NAVAIDS since it was night, multiple runways, and terrain in the area.  The First Officer conveyed this and reasoned that we didn't want to inadvertently end up on Runway 35; a definite threat even at a familiar field.  The Tower Controller was apparently annoyed with this and stated, 'Fine, we'll leave it on until you're on the ground.'  He then came back in a sarcastic tone and said, 'I was under the assumption you were cleared for a visual approach.'  I directed the First Officer to ignore the transmissions since we were now approximately 900' AGL and maneuvering onto final.  At the First Officer's 10-foot call, the centerline lights of Runway 34R extinguished.  The First Officer stated as we exited the runway that the centerline lights went out at 10 feet. Tower acknowledged.  We didn't know what had occurred, but it looked like a form of retribution for us not helping them out.  Hopefully that was just coincidental.  We definitely don't expect that form of unprofessionalism from ATC and in a human factors sense that could have been unsafe.  I understand that ATC has a lot to do during a runway swap.  However, the priority is the aircraft in flight.  I think they were just rushing to complete the switch.  Slow down.  It was only an extra minute until we were safely out of the way.				Air carrier landing SLC, and last to land on Runway 34R before a runway change, was ask by ATC if the ILS could be turned off, reporter replied negatively and then noted the center line lights were turned off on landing flare.

The bottom line was, both transponders were sending a code of 1200 even though the correct squawk was selected on the unit. The altitude reporting function was working correctly. Many questions came to mind as we climbed out enroute to DCA. Was I legal to enter controlled airspace? Was I legal to enter RVSM airspace? TRACON and Center had no problem with allowing me to continue, but what would Potomac Approach think about it? I contacted Dispatch to ask that our ATC liaison contact FAA ATC with that question. Very uncomfortable with the situation, while climbing out, Center informed me that my transponder info was about 10 miles behind my primary target. The Controller went on to say that upon reaching our cruise altitude they would have me turn off my transponder! With that info, I elected to return for repairs. I did not feel safe to continue the flight into RVSM airspace, with no transponder, no TCAS, as well as operate in the dense traffic environment found in the DC area, as well as the possibility of encountering security issues. I was surprised that ATC would allow me to do so!				A B737-800 Captain reported both transponders were not operating after takeoff.  He elected to return to departure airport even though ATC seemed amenable to him continuing with no transponder.

First Officer initiated climb. Captain informed tower. Tower gave VFR instructions to climb to 2000 FT. Target indicated -200 FT underneath aircraft as we flew over target. No aircraft sighted by crew or tower. Upon second approach at 2000 FT on glideslope, TCAS briefly gave an indication of traffic again at the same location showing -1900 FT, 11 o'clock, 1 mile. Target then disappeared. Area of target seemed to be near a high school sports field on final approach. No aircraft or other activity noted.		First Officer flying on visual approach to 25L inbound from LIMMA at 1900 FT descending. Received TA 400 FT below slightly left of center line. Followed by a 'limit vertical speed' when RA turned red at 300 below, then 'climb' at 200 below. I directed a go-around while contacting tower that we were responding to an RA and where were they as the traffic showed directly under us. Switched to approach vectors to visual 25 and again over LIMMA showed mode C traffic at 1900 FT below us at the same location. Soon disappeared after asking tower. Visual scan showed no aircraft and continued to normal landing. I suspect a small heli due to vertical change, but apparent stationary character of traffic.		An air carrier Crew on final approach to LAX Runway 25L reported a TCAS RA at 1,900 FT on final. After executing a go-around and a second approach to Runway 25R, a TCAS target was again seen at the same position but no traffic sighted.

We elected to go down to 380 in an effort to not have the same issue.  Approximately 40 east of ALS, we encountered the wave.  At first it was just an airspeed deviation.  Then it intensified and we had a 30 knot loss of airspeed as the jet went up 100'.  The aircraft then lost 600' while having a 2000 fpm descent.  At that point the autothrottles disengaged.  Denver Center was extremely helpful and even asked us if we wanted to go down below RVSM airspace.  They gave us a Pilot discretion descent to FL 290.  We stopped at FL340 and encountered no more mountain wave.  Our Dispatch let us know prior to departure that there had been some mountain wave in that area, but that the plots had expired and we should not have any problems.				A B737NG encountered intense mountain wave over the Rocky Mountains and descended to a lower altitude.

We coordinated for an immediate level off and a lower altitude.  Shuddering continued until approximately FL290 whereat we elected to slowly accelerate to almost 290K when the shuddering began again.  We continued to lower altitudes, slowed down and eventually ended up at FL230 and approximately 260K.  Shuddering was intermittent and less intense, but had no logic between airspeeds and altitudes.  We discussed continuing to our destination until we determined this was periodic shuddering and could not be avoided.  We coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and elected the best course of action was a return to the maintenance base at our departure station.  We performed exterior visual inspections, analyzed all systems and found no anomalies.  We coordinated for a controllability check in accordance with the manual on our return.  Although shuddering was still intermittent and lasted less than a minute and was spaced more than 3-5 minutes apart, no issues were found with controllability.  We landed uneventfully although the Captain noticed minor strange 'looseness' and nosewheel shimmy.  Aircraft did yaw once to the left when we lowered gear, but at no time did we feel any problems with total control of aircraft.  A thorough debrief with maintenance was conducted.				An unexplained recurring shudder in the airframe caused an A320 Flight Crew to return to their departure airport where the aircraft had just undergone heavy maintenance.

Normal events during taxi out and line up for position and hold.  When cleared for take off 1.1 EPR was set, stabilized, and auto throttle engaged.  Within 1 or 2 seconds of max EPR being set, we heard a loud 1 event bang.  I called for and performed the abort from a slow ground speed, but kept slowly moving down the runway to where I could exit.  We advised the flight attendants and passengers to remain seated. With no adverse engine indications, and a low cycle thump, thump, thump, I thought we had just blown a nose tire.  Tower was rolling emergency equipment to meet us as we exited the runway.  As we rolled to a stop, the vibrations we took as a tire thump did not stop and it became apparent to us we had an engine problem.  As we shut down engines right after stopping, interphone conversations began with cabin crew. Those on the left side of the aircraft reported flames out the front and rear of the engine during the bang event.  Relief Pilot went back to the cabin and observed cowl damage.  With CFR now on scene and in VHF contact, we asked them if we had any fluid leaks, fires, or other adverse events outside.  With a negative report, we relayed this to the cabin crew as they were standing by for possible unfolding events that could force us into an evacuation.  They then went into an armed door guarding mode for the next 2 hours it took us to be towed back to the terminal.  We were heavy and it took a relay of two tugs to get us back to terminal without overheating the tugs. I have had an in flight bearing failure on the 777 which resulted in landing thrust reversing of the engine making extreme noise and vibration.  I would call that event like a loud banshee shrill with heavy airframe vibration and adverse engine indications that ceased upon engine shutdown.  This event had just the low cycle vibration, normal engine noise, and no adverse cockpit engine indications.  CFR reported we had dropped parts from start of takeoff to our taxiway stopped position.   In a post flight debrief of the entire crew, on the way to our hotel, cabin crew said how important the 'remain in your seats' PA was to them.  Those on the left side seeing and hearing a bang/flash event out of the engine were ready to evacuate and were going through mental evac decisions, thoughts and preparations.  Our quick PA was very much appreciated. Post flight inspection from my point of view looked like a first stage fan blade failure.  As I do not believe this was a bird or other FOD ingestion event on our takeoff, I would guess blade failure caused a cascading event that chewed up other fan blades, and destroyed most of the stator vane assemblies aft of the fan.  There were uncontained fan area penetrations in the forward engine cowl, and associated internal fan duct destruction.  At the rear end of the lower fan duct cowl edge, there were other areas of damage. In closing I feel we were fortunate the event happened early in the takeoff allowing for a slow speed reject.  While our training prepares us well for the physical actions of an abort, it is the mental evaluation and coordination gymnastics of the individual events that we are never as prepared for as we are the physical actions.  All cockpit and cabin crew were very experienced and that was reflected in their professional actions.  Passengers were kept informed of developments in a timely manner and were described as 'great' by cabin crew.		This event probably took as much knowlege and use of leadership skills coordinating everything as did the actual abort/checklist procedures relating to aircraft operation! Good aircraft handling and cabin crew communications were exhibited by all involved.	Reporter stated aircraft type was B777-200.	A B777-200 flight crew experienced a fan blade failure early in the takeoff roll, leading to a reject decision.

The event occurred in clear air during descent into ORD.  Recent convective activity and a strong frontal gradient were in the area during the descent.  There were no reported injuries as a result of the incident.  The crew was briefed on the weather and ride situation into ORD.  We were familiar with each other as we had flown together for 3 legs over two days, and had left ORD the previous evening during convective activity.  The crew was prepared and anticipated turbulence, but severe turbulence was not forecast or reported recently.  We had a lengthy discussion about spring weather and preparedness, especially since we had a rough ride leaving ORD the night before.  I believe the briefing, preparation and awareness of the crew was instrumental in avoiding injury during this incident.  The aircraft was flying to JVL VOR to intercept the BULLZ1 arrival and beginning the initial descent.  There was no recent report of turbulence in the area, though we were wondering when it would begin.  We saw clouds in front of us while in the descent through FL260.  This is when we anticipated the turbulence would begin.  As [we] continued our descent, the airspeed began to increase inside the limits of the managed descent bracket, approaching Mmo/Vmo.  The autopilot was disengaged to prevent an overspeed, and the descent rate was arrested from the 6000 FPM range.  The aircraft began to slow, and we quickly discussed getting the flight attendants down when the first wave of turbulence hit.  The plane encountered moderate turbulence for about 15 seconds, and the seatbelt sign was turned on and the flight attendants were told to be seated.  After a break of about 30 seconds, we began to encounter severe turbulence passing FL220 and continuing down to 17,000 FT.  The autopilot, which had since been selected back on, was turned off again, as the slow response seemed to make things worse.  The aircraft was marginally controllable at times with VVI variations between +2500 to -6000 FPM, +/- 20 to 30 KTS airspeed variation, and at one point had idle thrust, full speed brakes and a +1000 FPM VVI.  We had been attempting to descend through the turbulence and slow to the TAPS (Turbulence Auto-PIREP System) airspeed during that event.  There was un-commanded roll and pitch which was violent, but within normal aircraft pitch and roll limits.  The aircraft left the turbulence at about 16,000 FT.  We noticed that the wind vector had shifted from 250/115 at FL260 to 170/65 at 17,000.  At the end of the incident, the Lead Flight Attendant was called to see if anyone was injured.  She had told us no one was hurt and that the two of the flight attendants were in their jumpseats and one stayed on the floor.  The flight attendants then prepared the cabin for landing, and after a short lull, the remainder of the flight concluded in light to moderate chop.  During the incident, Chicago Center Controllers seemed to be in disbelief as to the severity of the turbulence.  They continued to give instructions and crossing restrictions even after receiving information that our control of the aircraft was diminished due to the severe turbulence.  They were reluctant to inform other aircraft of the severe turbulence.  I was disappointed with the performance of the typically elite controllers in the Chicago Center.  With two jumpseating pilots in the cockpit, everyone agreed this was unquestionably severe turbulence and for the majority, the worse clear air turbulence encountered.  Chicago Center seemed unresponsive in this situation, and though we can all get reluctant to use the phrase 'severe turbulence', this doesn't appear to be a mis-characterization of the situation.  We listened and it seemed that other aircraft followed us through the area. After landing, we taxied to the gate, informed Maintenance, and conducted a crew debrief.  Upset passengers had to wait 20 minutes for a jetway so theycould de-plane, and people were again asked if anyone was injured.  No one indicated any injuries.  Though this was an unfortunate and unexpected clear air turbulence encounter, the preparation and training of the crew played an important role in avoiding serious injury.  We had expected some turbulence in the descent, but associated with the front and convective activity, not the clear air shearing that was encountered.  Continued contact and updates from Dispatch and especially Chicago Center could have helped to mitigate the circumstances even further.  Nonetheless, for our situation, we are fortunate that the outcome was positive.				An A320 flight crew reported encountering severe turbulence on descent into ORD.

We had no aircraft on our TCAS when we suddenly got a Traffic Alert of an aircraft heading directly at us at +500 feet and approximately 10 miles.  The TA quickly became an RA with the immediate instructions to descend accompanied by the visual presentation indicating a descent on my PFD.  I disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles and started an immediate descent.  At approximately FL 275 we got a clear of traffic advisory and the target completely disappeared from the TCAS.  While I was flying the aircraft, my Copilot told NYC that we were descending in compliance with an RA.  ATC acted like they did not even know what an RA was and stated that the only aircraft in our area was a Military aircraft at FL250.  The Military pilot then volunteered that he had a Mode C failure.  We never saw an aircraft above us and were not even looking for aircraft below us that we were in fact descending toward.  Apparently we never got closer than 2500 feet of the conflicting (and malfunctioning) aircraft.  I climbed back to FL280 after descending only 500'.  I can't believe that the military is flying around with such faulty equipment and that ATC does not seem to understand our obligations if we have an RA.

This was followed shortly (within 4-5 seconds) by a TCAS aural Resolution Advisory (RA) 'DESCEND, DESCEND'. This was promptly complied with by the pilot flying while I advised ATC. ATC advised us that they had no traffic at FL285, but a Navy aircraft was at our 12 o'clock position at FL250 with a malfunctioning Mode C Transponder. After climbing back and maintaining FL280, it became apparent that following the TCAS RA was actually descending us INTO the traffic that was creating the TA/RA due to an admitted malfunctioning Mode C Transponder. Due to the rapid onset of the RA, neither visual nor ATC confirmation of the traffic could be made prior to actually executing the RA maneuver.				A B777 pilot reported receiving erroneous TCAS TA and RA warnings which he believed were generated by an aircraft below them with a malfunctioning Transponder Mode C.

Rides and destination conditions were choppy and I wanted flexibility to seek better rides if chop or turbulence was encountered. Also, since I was given no alternate fuel, experience has shown that events can and do occur which compromise the landing conditions (weather, mechanical, FOD, or sudden runway or airport closure, thus requiring delaying the landing or deviating to an alternate airport. On this flight, after constant moderate turbulence on approach, we were instructed, on a 200 FT final, to go-around by DEN Tower. After clean-up they told us that there was a sudden MICROBURST alert on the field. We told them that we could not land at DEN while this was happening. They immediately stated that the alert had subsided. We were then given vectors to a different runway and commenced the approach in moderate turbulence conditions to landing (a Flight Attendant with many years seniority stated it was the worst turbulence she has ever experienced). With the additional fuel that I added, we were planned to land with 7,300 LBS of fuel. Our actual arrival fuel was 4,700 LBS. Had I not added the additional fuel we would have landed with approximately 3,700 LBS. If the airport would have continued under this adverse condition, our options to continue a safe flight would have been severely compromised. Needless to say, this was a very uncomfortable situation, even with the extra fuel that I added. I called Dispatch and asked with respect, who is responsible for these continued low fuel loads we are dispatched with? The Dispatcher stated with obvious frustration that the new fuel policy directed to all dispatchers is to reduce fuel loads on dispatch and that the dispatchers are receiving letters of reprimand and disciplinary action if they deviate from this policy. He said it is directive from the new guy in charge of the fuel policy. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. In the name of saving whatever amount it costs to carry a safe fuel load we are compromising the safety of our crews, our passengers our aircraft and potentially many lives on the ground. I have found it necessary to ask for extra fuel on roughly 7 out of 10 flights that I am in command of. In my opinion, this ridiculous policy must end voluntarily or we will find ourselves facing a catastrophic situation.				B737 Captain laments the low fuel loads that his company requires Dispatchers to use in the interest cost savings without regard for safety.

We agreed and ran the proper checklists, started both engines, briefed the Passengers and Crew, and waited for clearance to taxi to the active Runway 28.  Ground cleared us to the runway and to change over to Tower frequency.  At this moment the First Officer didn't switch over to Tower frequency and elected to send the Company an updated operations report.  The Captain assumed we were cleared for takeoff and asked for the Before Takeoff checklist.  After completion of checklist, the Captain taxied onto the runway, transferred the controls, and stated we were cleared for takeoff.  The First Officer accepted controls and took off.  After reaching a safe altitude, ATC gave us a number to call when we landed.  After landing, the Captain contacted the Tower and clarified the confusion.  The Captain and the Controllers handled the situation professionally.		We had a moved up flow time to meet, engines shut down, and Passengers up out of their seats issues to deal with.  We didn't verify the takeoff clearance when we really were not sure we had been cleared or not.		A B737-700 crew released early from a ground delay, quickly started engines, got passengers seated and proceeded to takeoff without takeoff clearance.

As we examined it, it was continuing to increase in length. It then started to create an air tunnel in which there seemed to be fluid. About this time we noticed that it started to develop a small (maybe an inch) electrical arch, and then we heard a loud bang, and the outer pane of the window shattered. This all happened very quickly, and had it not been for the keen eyes of the First Officer, we would have had no idea why this happened. We contacted Dispatch and had them conference in Maintenance Control. After discussion with our Maintenance Control and referencing our flight manual, we determined that it was indeed the outer pane that had shattered, and that there was only one flight restriction which would not be prohibitive to continuing the flight to our destination. Upon further consultation with Dispatch and Maintenance, it was agreed that all parties involved were comfortable with the flight still being able to be conducted in a safe manner, and that no need to deviate was necessary. All SOPs and flight manual procedures followed. The rest of the flight was uneventful and a normal landing was made at our destination.		After referring to the Flight Manual we descended to FL220, slowed down, brought the differential pressure to less than 5, and made sure the windshield heat was off on the First Officer side. After consulting with Maintenance and Dispatch we continued to our destination. Landing was uneventful and we debriefed Maintenance.		An A320 First Officer's front windshield outer pane cracked while cruising at FL360. The outer layer was non structural so the flight slowed and descended, as per the QRH, then continued to its destination.

By the time both pilots attention was brought to the ECAM screen the message had disappeared.  Something in regard to ENG2 had been observed but the rest of the script disappeared too quickly to be read.  A 'RCL' [recall] was attempted and the message could not be brought up.  The Captain brought up CFDS (centralized fault display system) function in his MCDU (multi-function control and display unit) and a 'CURRENT LEG ECAM REPORT' was requested from button 2L.  At this time the ENG2 Reverse Unlocked was noted in the history as the ECAM we had seen.  Although brief, this ECAM caused concern to the crew as it is a fairly significant flight event to have a reverser unlock or un-stow.  An emergency phone patch was requested from dispatch and Maintenance Control.  Maintenance Control could not definitively give us a cause or an in-flight reset of this fault but it caused us enough concern to return to our departure airport.  As the fault did not re-appear, we did not run the IRREG Checklist but we briefed it and had it ready to execute if needed.  We also decided the LAND ASAP section of the IRREG checklist could be belayed as long as the fault did not come back.  We did have multiple diversion airports available.   We declared an emergency with ATC to get priority routing back to the airport.  We landed without further incident.  AMTs (Aircraft Maintenance Technicians) there informed us the ECAM fault had a history over the past few days but since it was such a brief fault we were the first to report it.  An initial verbal report from the AMTs indicated 'probably' a wiring fault.  The aircraft was removed from service for repair. I am very troubled we took off in an aircraft with a potentially catastrophic fault.  As the AMTs noted, this fault had been occurring for a few days.  The jet knew it was faulting; it appears the company has no way to cull this information prior to an actual fault event.  I would strongly recommend we utilize the technology we have available and have a qualified AMT take a reading from the CFDS (Centralized Fault Display System) computer between every leg.  I believe this can be done remotely.  ALSO, systems knowledge allowed the crew to access the CFDS system and extract much needed safety information for this flight (i.e; what was that ECAM we couldn't recall?).  The AOM is fairly limited with information on this valuable informational tool and the crew recommends a more comprehensive description of the CFDS system and its capabilities be included in our training and the AOM.  Without the information we could have continued with a very insidious but serious fault that could have manifested into a serious incident.				A briefly illuminated EICAS message was eventually determined to have been an ENG2 Reverse Unlock advisory after a review of the CURRENT LEG ECAM REPORT on the CFDS page.  The A320 Flight Crew then opted to declare an emergency and return to their departure airport for maintenance.

We then got an ECAM, F/CTL (flight controls) flaps locked. We broke off the approach to hold south of the airport to run the ECAM and the QRH. The flaps locked somewhere between up and 1. We could not get them up or down. After looking at landing performance with the First Officer we initially came up with a distance of about 7000 feet. We were just under max landing weight. The runway at MWCR is 7008 feet. With the flaps locked at about 1 we knew that we would not be able to divert back to the US. After conferring with the First Officer and the Dispatcher, I felt the runway that provided the largest safety margin possible was MKJS, where the runway is 8735 feet. Fuel was not a problem as we were tankering for the flight back to the US. The landing was made at MKJS without any further problems.				A320 Captain reports flaps locked during approach to MWCR. Attempts to remedy the situation are unsuccessful and with the flaps less than 1 the crew elected to divert to an airport with a longer runway.

Cleared for the approach I hit the APP button. (Localizer was coming in from left and we were approximately 1 1/2 dots below glide slope). 2 to 3 seconds later the aircraft violently pitched up as if to acquire glide slope. This led to a second or 2 of confusion followed by disengaging the autopilot. As airspeed bled off the auto throttle's kicked in aggressively, exacerbating the pitch. Saw at least 15 degree nose up, vsi +3500, airspeed 120 (-25), and ballooned to approximately 3400 FT MSL, (blew thru glide slope). After disengaging auto throttle's was able to wrestle it back down as ATC started telling us to get down due to some corridor. Considered going around, but was comfortable enough (with distance and altitude) to try and get back in the slot. Began configuring, after some fairly massive corrections we were close enough to parameters that I stupidly tried to reengage the autopilot which didn't work, so I hand flew it in from there, (breaking out shortly after at about 1200 FT) to an otherwise uneventful landing. TOGA was NOT selected.				B737 Captain experienced violent pitch up as the aircraft is about to intercept the Runway 11 LOC at OAK with the autopilot engaged. Aircraft climbed from 2600 to 3400 FT before control was regained and the aircraft hand flown to a successful landing.

We were cleared for a visual approach. The Captain who was the flying pilot was flying a very fast approach. He was maintaining 250 KTS until approx 2.5 miles from the outer marker. He began configuring by calling for gear just below 250 KTS. At 210 KTS he called for flaps 1 shortly thereafter we received a Flight Control Slats Locked ECAM. I was starting to analyze the ECAM message, and first noted a maximum speed message which I read aloud. During this process the Captain continued to call for flaps as he was trying to configure the airplane for landing and trying to maintain stabilized approach criteria. I also was trying to finish the landing checklist to comply with stabilized approach criteria. I double checked we had the correct speed for the next flap setting and complied with his command to set flaps. I was momentarily distracted by his approach speed and wondering if we were going to be stabilized. When I returned to the ECAM, I realized we had a slat issue and was beginning to brief the Captain on what we had so far. The Captain continued the approach and was still calling for flaps. Once again my attention was diverted from the ECAM. By the time I set the final flaps, and returned to ECAM we were on short final. I looked at the airspeed indicator and realized VLS was indicating higher than normal, I believe I said something to the extent that something seems not correct and that we have a slat problem. The Captain said he agreed, but decided to continue the approach. Our airspeed at this time was still considerably higher than normal. The Captain maintained this higher airspeed until touchdown. The touchdown and rollout were normal. I did not feel it was prudent to have my head buried in the ECAM on short final, and since the airplane appeared to be flying normally I focused my attention on landing and abandoned the ECAM. I also felt the extra airspeed was prudent at the time given the fact we did have a slat malfunction.  After landing and clearing the runway, I finally had a chance to perform the rest of the ECAM procedure. It was then clear we had a slat malfunction. I realized immediately we should have abandoned the approach and gone around in order to troubleshoot the problem. I attribute the failure to properly carry out ECAM procedures to two major issues. The first was the Captain's unconventional high speed approach. Second, was my distraction in trying to comply with the Captain's commands to configure the airplane. I was also distracted while trying to ensure the Captain was flying a stabilized approach. Additionally, I only was able to see the first page of ECAM which listed a maximum speed, each time I set flaps the ECAM page changed which meant I had to reinterpret the new page and subsequently was unable to move to additional ECAM pages. I disagree with flying high speed approaches in this manner. Even if the approach is stabilized it creates a huge distraction for the non flying pilot. Things were happening fast enough during the approach, that I never really had time to complete ECAM and to analyze what the extent of the problem was. I feel quite comfortable in the airplane, but even so I simply did not have enough time to complete the procedure. I also did not have enough information on what the failure was at the time to call for the Captain to abandon the approach. Obviously there are several rather important considerations associated with this particular ECAM. Once the Captain realized as well we had some type of malfunction, he used prudent judgment and increased approach speed to a margin well above VLS.				An A320 First Officer reported noticing F/CTRL Slats Locked ECAM on approach, but the workload imposed by the high speed approach led the crew to ignore the message and continue to a landing.

The Flight Attendant in the back called and said they were smelling an odor also.  The Captain got a call off to Dispatch and Maintenance.  The odor was getting worse so I asked the Captain if he wanted me to run the QRH.  We put on our O2 mask, and ran it.  When I put the two fan switches in OVRD, the noise went away.  I lifted my mask to see if the smell was going a way and it was getting better but still there.  We then started to divert and declare an emergency.  Landed with out any further incident and the odor was gone.		Thinking it was the chiller, I confirmed it was off as well as the ovens.  Shortly after.  Sent the First Officer back to investigate.  When the First Officer returned we also started smelling smoke in the cockpit, also got a call from the aft flight attendants that they also smelled smoke in the back.  After donning our oxygen masks, the First Officer did the smoke in the cockpit QRH and as I still had Dispatch on the frequency I coordinated our diversion airport as it was approximately 60 miles behind us.  Told First Officer to declare an emergency and get us headed to the divert airport as I called the flight attendants and advised them of our intentions and would be landing in about 10 minutes and to expect a normal landing.

By the time we pushed back, the right wheels were in the mid 200s and the left wheels were in the mid-100s. Taxi clearance was received for Runway 25, a generally downhill route from the gate. Because of the temperature split between the right and left trucks, I elected to use minimal braking with the left gear only, allowing the right truck to cool further on the way to the runway. We had a short delay in receiving final weights necessitating a period of time with the parking brake set just prior to beginning the takeoff roll. During takeoff at approximately 70 KIAS the Hot Brakes ECAM and Caution sounded indicating that one of the left wheels was over 300 degrees. This did not make sense, as just prior to taking the runway both brake temps on the left side were well below 200 degrees. The First Officer was pilot flying and I advised him to continue the takeoff. The power was never reduced, nor were the brakes applied. As a precaution, once safely airborne we completed the 'Hot Brakes' ECAM procedure. Point one: Prior to my flight day, I read through the maintenance records of this aircraft and one other. When seeing the above ECAM during takeoff, I incorrectly remembered the maintenance history indicating the exact same brake temperature event during a takeoff by another crew. The mistake: This event occurred in the other aircraft, not ours. Point two: While the rapid rise in left wheel temps during the start of the takeoff roll did not seem to be likely, or even possible, I feel that I should have relied upon the takeoff safety briefing (as given by me) and aborted the takeoff in the low-speed regime. Point three: Contract Maintenance was called out to check the left wheel assembly and a loose connection was found, and the brake temperature indicating system was deferred.				An A320 Captain continued the takeoff from a high altitude airport despite an ECAM HOT BRAKES warning received below 80K.

I asked ATC for a level off at 3000 ft and for an extended right down wind and told ATC that we will need to return to the airport. The First Officer placed the gear handle in the down position. We then went through the QRH and non-normal supplemental book. Following the non-normal supplemental book for the ECAM messages we recycled the landing and this time the gear retracted. The gear indications were back to normal. I then decided not to return to the departure airport but to continue on to our destination since the gear was up and no fault messages were present. I felt it was safer to continue on because I would be landing 9000 lbs over weight if we landed at our departure airport. After reaching cruise I talked to Dispatch and Maintenance Control, they agreed that continuing was the best course of action to take. Landed with no problems.

The First Officer and I looked for traffic and very quickly got traffic alert from TCAS.  We very quickly got a RA to descend.  I quickly turned off the autopilot and auto-throttles and descended the aircraft until the RA stopped.  We both saw the small general aviation aircraft very close off our left side and about 400 feet above our aircraft.  It appeared to me that this aircraft was left wing down maneuvering to avoid us.  I asked the ATC Controller why he didn't vector us away or descend us sooner to avoid this situation which was uncomfortable.  I thought ATC could have done a better job since there was very little, if any, traffic in the area or at the airport at that time.		At the completion of the maneuver, we both saw the small aircraft out the left side and above us by about 400-500' (it appeared to be maneuvering to avoid us).

As we were preparing for our arrival into MIA, we obtained ATIS and current weather. MIA reported easterly operations with winds shifting from the west. Winds were approximately 17 KTS with gust to 22 KTS. With the winds shifting, we briefed ILS Runway 30 approach. While descending for the arrival, ZMA issued us holding instructions for CYY per published holding, but with 20 mile legs. Our expect further clearance time was an hour after entering holding. We computed our fuel with regard to our alternate. We had fuel for one turn in holding and we were going to divert to our alternate. We notified Dispatch of our intent to divert to MCO when our fuel state dictated. After entering holding at CYY, ATC advised us we were number 3 for MIA. Captain asked the Controller which runway MIA was utilizing. They advised Runways 9 and 12. We briefed ILS Runway 9. Soon after entering holding, ATC provided us vectors to the airport. We requested vectors for the ILS Runway 9. ATC advised us we would be number 14 for ILS Runway 9 approach, but could put us in number 3 for the GPS Runway 12 approach. The GPS Runway 12 approach was loaded and briefed. Soon after initiating the approach for Runway 12, ATC canceled our approach clearance and vectored us back around for the GPS Runway 12 approach again. Soon we were established back on the GPS Runway 12 approach, we were asked if we could accept the visual for Runway 8L. We could not accept that and continued on with our approach to Runway 12. Approaching minimums on the approach, we thought we saw the runway but lost sight. I call for an initiated a go-around and we advised Tower. As I was in the process of initiating a go-around, we received a 'too low' squawk. This was followed by a call from Tower that they received an altitude alert on us. We continued on our missed approach from the published heading and altitude. While climbing to our missed approach altitude, we were assigned a heading for vectors for another approach. We requested ILS, Runway 9. We were vectored to Runway 9 for the ILS and landed. Note:  high northerly winds during approach of approximately 30 KTS. Always during low visibility, high winds, rain and night time operations fly precision approaches when available.		An immediate go-around was performed. During climb out, Tower said they had an altitude alert on us and at the same time the GPWS squawked, 'too low.' The go-around was uneventful and we received vectors for another approach to 12. We requested an ILS to 9 and got vectors for the approach to 9. We landed on Runway 9 without any further problems. I don't know why ATC got the altitude alert on the go-around and can only speculate that the GPWS was looking at the glideslope for Runway 9 as it was tuned. This was a VERY busy approach with many negative human factors. Lessons learned. At night with weather and wind, if you have fuel, take the precision approach even if you're number 14!		B737 Flight Crew reported two go arounds while attempting the GPS to Runway 12 at MIA during high winds and rain.

A GPWS low altitude alert and an alert from the tower were received during the second go-around.  Successful ILS ensued.

We exited runway and tire failure was confirmed by MIA Dade (Airport) Representative. Company Maintenance was informed and tow-in to gate was requested and received. Damage was later discovered by MIA Dade to a temporary taxi light positioned near the centerline taxiway at approach end of Runway 12 which was a possible source of damage to the failed tire. Please note that the temporary taxi lights appeared to be arranged in an extremely haphazard and erratic fashion and were obscured by moderate to heavy rain at the time of the incident. Also there was extreme urgency by the Tower to rush the takeoff.		[We had an] extensive delay on taxi out for weather. When number 1 for takeoff, Tower informed us there would be a longer delay due to numerous landing aircraft that had been holding. Shortly thereafter, Tower cleared us into position and hold and stated to be ready for an immediate takeoff. Conditions were moderate to heavy rain showers with aircraft making turns shortly after takeoff for weather avoidance. Upon initiating takeoff roll, felt significant aircraft vibration and slight pull to the right. [We] accomplished an uneventful abort at less than approximately 50 KTS. We were later informed that Miami Dade had discovered a damaged temporary taxi light near the end of Runway 12 which may have been the source of damage to the tire. The temporary taxi lights were not aligned and seemed placed in a meandering manner and was difficult to discern in the prevailing weather conditions.		B737 flight crew reports tire failure during takeoff roll and low speed abort. It was later discovered that a temporary taxi light at the end of Runway 12 had been damaged likely causing the tire failure.

We were right at maximum landing weight on landing and could have had a better safety margin since the flight time was 3:52 and the First Officer identified that landing weight issue after about 1:30 into the flight. I do not believe that we landed overweight but due to our Quality Assurance System data possibly showing it because of fuel quantity being incorrect at a second in time at touchdown because of being so close to the limit, I wanted to make a report. Captains need to be given more power to handle misbehaving First Officers. If First Officers that like to challenge Captain's thought they would be in real jeopardy of consequences for bad behavior which is insubordination, they would be much less likely to do it. Then the overall chain of command would be intact and function correctly thus enhancing safety margins and regulatory compliance.				An A320 Captain described being unable to resolve a CRM conflict with his First Officer regarding seemingly minor issues such as cabin temperature and aircraft landing weight.

Tower then ordered him across, so we landed with him on the same runway. While I'm fully capable of landing in the required distance, landing on the same runway where another aircraft is operating is really dumb. The risk reward here is tilted so far in the favor of risk that I can't believe I'm even filling out this report. What will you guys agree to next to save a few minutes of taxi time?				An 320 pilot took exception to the Local Controller coercing a B767 Captain to cross his runway while on short final during LAHSO operations.

He asked if we could go direct NIBLE (IAF), we accepted, and then started the turn.  At this point we were past NIBLE and had to turn about 140 degrees, virtually entering a downwind.  Approach then cleared us for the RNAV approach.  The Captain was the pilot flying.  I believe it was his first attempt at practicing an RNAV approach.  I have only done one myself.  Due to the close proximity to NIBLE, the autopilot was turning right towards the fix and shortly started a left turn towards POTME.  At some point, the Captain unknowingly disengaged LNAV and went into Control Wheel Steering. I alerted him that he was in Control Wheel Steering, but he did not respond.  I'm not positive what happened next, but we were off course, confused with what the airplane was doing, and descending.  The Captain disengaged the autopilot and continued descending while flying away from the field.  I instructed him a couple times to stop descending and that he needed to level off.  I pointed in the direction of the field and told him we needed to climb and get back on glidepath.  Due to being uncomfortable and fixated with the new RNAV procedures, the Captain was unresponsive to my verbal alerts.  As we started turning towards the field, we were off course and low.  We had descended below the charted altitude at POTME of 2,600 FT to about 1,700 FT MSL which is about nine miles from the TDZ.  ATC alerted us to our altitude, I responded with 'correcting,' and requested the visual to 31.  He cleared us for the visual.  We got back on glidepath and landed.  This event occurred as direct result of being unfamiliar with the new RNAV procedures.  We, as pilots, must be extra aware and alert of our own limitations with these procedures.  Always fly the airplane!  I felt I was assertive as the pilot not flying, but there was room for improvement on my end as well.  Listen to other crew members and always practice good CRM.		On a VFR day we requested a RVAV approach to 31, and ATC clear us for the RNAV Approach. Prior to starting the approach we had the autopilot on. VNAV, LNAV, and autothrottles also were on. We were fast so I went to program a slower speed. I inadvertently deleted the altitude at NIBLE. The First Officer suggested we go direct to POTME and I agreed.The altitude was selected in the window. As we were turning towards POTME, the airplane descended past the altitude selected in the window. ATC advise us we were low, so we climbed back up, and realized the autopilot disconnected. We canceled the RNAV approach, requested a visual, and were cleared. The landing was uneventful and we taxied to the gate. No conflict was noted by ATC or the Tower.		B737-700 flight crew experienced difficulties attempting to practice a RNAV approach in VMC. CWS was inadvertently selected and the aircraft descended prematurely triggering a low altitude alert from ATC and an EGPWS warning. A visual approach ensued.

We had been kept high for traffic.  We told ATC we could not make the crossing so they gave us 8000'.  We had a high rate of descent with the speedbrakes up.  At just before 8000', we were given a frequency change.  When I looked up from the radios we were going through 7600'.  The MCP altitude was 5000'.  At the same time, the First Officer asked if we had been cleared to 5000'.  I answered we had not.  He was also trying to disconnect the autopilot and nothing happened.  He said, 'It won't let me have it.'  He then realized the autopilot had disconnected with no warning at all.  The airplane was way out of trim nose down.  As he was pulling back on the yoke, he was also trimming the nose up, and we were able to climb back up to 8000' from about 7300'.  (All CBs checked okay.)  Our highest speed in the descent was 320 knots.  We never came near the red line.  Our rate of descent was 4300 FPM.  Neither of [us] touched the MCP.  We never received a Stab Out of Trim light or an autopilot disconnect warning.  We have no idea why the altitude changed from 8000' to 5000'.  On the downwind after everything settled down, we reconnected the autopilot.  Everything worked fine, and when we disconnected it for the approach, we got the disconnect warning.  On the ground I called the Company and was told the airplane had no history of problems.  It must have been a glitch in the MCP.  We agreed to take the aircraft to the next city.  We had a normal flight and descent.		Descending, we were told to cross the next intersection at 8,000'.  We were given the cross restriction late so our descent rate was 4,200' per minute to comply with the crossing restriction.  I was the Pilot Flying.  Approaching 8,000', I observed the aircraft was not beginning to level and immediately applied significant back pressure on the yoke.  The aircraft did not respond.  I then proceeded to disconnect the autopilot.  It was at this point that I realized the autopilot was not engaged.  It wasn't until I applied significant force with both hands and re-trimmed that the aircraft began to level.  By this point, we had descended to 7,300'.  We immediately climbed back up to 8,000' and leveled off.  Neither I nor the Captain, at any point, heard the Autopilot Disconnect Warning horn signaling the autopilot had disengaged.  We also observed the MCP panel momentarily go blank while I was initially trying to level the aircraft.  Furthermore, when the MCP panel regained power it was not showing the information as previously set.  (LNAV and VNAV were not selected, autopilot was disengaged, and the altitude window was showing 5,000'.)  I reset the MCP panel, engaged the autopilot, and flew the remainder of the flight without incident.  Once on the ground we contacted Maintenance Control, advised them of the incident, and were given the go-ahead to continue on.		A B737-700 in a high rate of descent after a late descent clearance lost MCP functioning and allowed the aircraft to go through the cleared altitude. The autopilot had disconnected with no warning, the MCP blanked and returned with a lower altitude.

Rides and destination conditions were choppy and I wanted flexibility to seek better rides if chop or turbulence were encountered. Also, since I was given no alternate fuel, experience has shown that events can and do occur which compromise the landing conditions (weather, mechanical, FOD or sudden runway or airport closure), thus requiring delaying the landing or deviating to an alternate airport. On this flight, after constant moderate turbulence on approach we were instructed on a 200 FT final go-around by DEN Tower. After clean-up they told us that there was a sudden microburst alert on the field. We told them that we could not land at DEN while this was happening. They immediately stated that the alert had subsided. We were given vectors to a different runway and commenced the approach in moderate turbulence to landing (a Flight Attendant with many years seniority stated it was the worst turbulence she has ever experienced). With the additional fuel, we were planned to land with 7300 LBS of fuel. Our actual arrival fuel was 4700 LBS. Had I not added the additional fuel we would have landed with approximately 3700 LBS. If the airport would have continued under these adverse conditions, our options to continue a safe flight would have been severely compromised. Needless to say this was a very uncomfortable situation even with the extra fuel that I added. I called Dispatch and asked with respect who is responsible for these continued low fuel loads we are dispatched with. The Dispatcher stated with obvious frustration that the new fuel policy directed to all Dispatchers is to reduce fuel loads on dispatch and that the Dispatchers are receiving letters of reprimand and disciplinary action if they deviate from this policy. He said it is a directive from the new guy in charge of the fuel policy. He stated there were two dispatchers on leaves because of violating the new fuel policy. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. In the name of saving what ever amount it costs to carry a safe fuel load we are compromising the safety of our crews, our passengers, our aircraft and potentially many lives on the ground. I have found it necessary to ask for extra fuel on roughly 7 out of 10 flights that I am in command of. In my opinion, this ridiculous policy must end voluntarily or we will find ourselves facing a catastrophic situation.				B737 Captain describes his company's fuel policy requiring Dispatchers to assign only FAR minimum fuel. The reporter must routinely add fuel to provide a safe margin.

It occurred while on OJAAY ONE RNAV ARRIVAL into DCA. Just prior to the event, we had been vectored off the arrival at RIC for spacing, and then resumed the arrival. While at 10,000 FT/250 knots between RIC and OJAAY we were given the following instruction by Potomac Approach, 'turn right heading 040 and intercept the final.' As pilot monitoring, I read back 'right turn 040 and intercept the final approach course for Runway 1.' Approximately 30 seconds later, Potomac Approach Controller stated, 'I told you heading 040 after OJAAY.' I responded with 'Approach, I heard and read back the clearance for a right turn to 040 to intercept the final approach for Runway 1.' The Controller then issued a left turn heading 320, and about 10 seconds later a right turn heading 040 to intercept the final approach course; this resolved the miscommunication and no traffic conflict resulted. The Captain and I both understood the clearance to be an immediate right turn heading 040 to intercept the Runway 1 final approach course. During the entire approach, the Potomac Approach Controller was speaking to numerous aircraft in a sarcastic and unprofessional manner; he sounded agitated and slightly overwhelmed. At one point another aircraft said with a disappointed tone, 'Come on!' It sounded like ATC had a voice change on the frequency shortly thereafter, possibly the Supervisor relieving the Controller for a break. ATC should maintain standard radio communication discipline and monitor readback in case what he intended to say was not the clearance received. ATC Supervisor should have stepped in sooner and help when Controller is overwhelmed/agitated.		There is the very real possibility that the Controller said 'after OJAAY' in our clearance. But what we both heard and understood was 'turn right...' like now. What we readback was 'turn right...'There are a number of factors which led up to our implied deviation from ATC clearance. I would recommend the following to prevent future errors:1)  No unprofessional chatter on the frequency.2)  Remember...both pilots may not be 'regulars' into DCA. We have absolutely no preconceived notion of what clearance to expect. Charted procedures are the only thing we have to rely on.3)  The STAR says to EXPECT RADAR vectors to final approach course after IRONS. If you intend to regularly use OJAAY, maybe the note should be moved to OJAAY.4)  Adding an IRONS transition to the ILS Runway 1 approach chart would cut down on 'conditional' radar vector clearances which can easily be truncated by radio chatter...and misunderstood.5)  Controllers should pay close attention to 'readback errors'...had the Controller actually heard our readback, he would have caught the error before we started a turn. Maybe the 'regulars' abbreviate their readbacks...and the Controllers have gotten used to it, I don't know. We were not abbreviating our clearance.		B737 flight crew reports misunderstanding a clearance to turn to 040 degrees after OJAAY and turns immediately to that heading, much to the chagrin of a PCT Controller. The B737 crew is rebuked by the Controller, along with another air carrier crew that had also deviated from their cleared route.

The Captain said he had the light traffic below us, and then we immediately received a TCAS RA, 'Climb, climb.'  I deselected the autopilot and auto throttles and began a climb.  At some point, I saw the target go from -4 to -3 on the ND TCAS display.  The Captain informed ATC that we were climbing in response to a RA.  The ATC Controller said, 'Don't climb.'  While this was happening, I received a TCAS Adjust Vertical Speed warning.  I adjusted the pitch attitude (down) to decrease the aircraft's pitch attitude to remain inside the RA guidance on the PFD.  Then the Captain said he had the RJ in sight and pointed.  When I visually acquired the RJ, we were in level flight.  I waited for the Clear of Conflict Aural indication, and then I descended to 6000 feet.  This whole event was very quick.  I am estimating less than ten seconds from the first TCAS RA 'Climb, climb' until the 'Clear of Conflict.'  A turn from ATC in any direction would have prevented the three airplanes from being in such close proximity.  I think we usually train to TCAS RAs with a conflict from a single aircraft.  We were sandwiched with an aircraft 500 feet below in a slight climb and constrained by one above.				A B737NG experienced two TCAS RAs within seconds with a light plane 500 feet below them and a CRJ 1000 feet above.

I was concerned about the ramifications of that, and called Maintenance and Dispatch.  My main concern was that when the vacuum system ceased to function as we descended through FL180 or so that the flush motor would then be running continuously.  I asked Maintenance if there was a danger of the motor overheating and causing a fire, and he said he hadn't heard of that happening, but couldn't be sure.  I asked if there was anything I could do, and was told that I could pull the Flush system CB [Circuit Breaker] in the aft galley, but doing so would be using my emergency authority.  I was concerned enough about the motor overheating and causing a fire during the approach that I elected to do that, and preceded to the aft galley to pull the CB.  I was informed by the Flight Attendants that as we descended below FL180 the toilet stopped flushing, which is what I was hoping would happen.  I felt that in order to operate the flight at the highest level of safety that exercising my emergency authority to pull the CB in flight was the correct action.Descending to our destination, we were given holding.  The field was VFR, and holding was not forecast or expected.  We were immediately talking to Dispatch about our options, because fuel was going to be critical very quickly.  As we were about to divert to another airport, we got a call from the purser stating that a female passenger in her 20s, was unconscious and that they would get back to me when they could.  Knowing that fuel was getting to a level where a decision had to be made immediately, I had my First Officer declare a medical emergency and requested priority handling.  I coordinated with Dispatch to have the paramedics meet the flight.  We were very busy but, as we turned about a 15 mile final, we were able to ascertain from the Purser that the passenger was on O2, had started to regain consciousness, and was traveling with her parents.  The parents at this point said that they thought that she would be fine, and didn't want to bother with the paramedics anymore.  I told the Flight Attendant to inform them that we had already declared an emergency, and would be landing shortly, and that the paramedics would be there.  I also requested that they keep everyone seated until the paramedics had reached the passenger who was in distress.  The approach and landing were normal, and the paramedics were waiting for our arrival and boarded the airplane.				An A320 Flight Crew declared a medical emergency due to an unconscious passenger and landed at their destination.  The event was preceded by an anomaly regarding a toilet flush motor that caused the Captain to exert his command authority to pull the flush motor circuit breaker.

Continued descent to 10000 FT and began turn back to the departure airport. Uneventful landing, coordinated with Fire Chief on the ground, taxied to the gate.		I also spoke to the Flight Attendants via cabin intercom to advise them of our situation. Cabin continued to climb through 14000 FT.

An emergency was then declared with Tower (assistance was not requested). The First Officer and I had a brief discussion regarding aircraft controllability with the current condition and configuration (landing configuration: flaps 30). Controllability was good throughout the remainder of the approach, although continuous forward pressure on the yoke was necessary. The First Officer had to adjust the manual trim wheel, as the auto throttles were placarded inoperative. Due to our close proximity to the runway, I decided to continue the approach with the current condition and configuration. An uneventful landing followed. At the gate, the First Officer found the stab trim actuator circuit breaker popped. A log entry was made.				B737 flight crew experienced an electric trim failure during approach and continued to landing using manual trim after an emergency was declared.

Our flight number was ABC. There were a minimum of 7 similar call signs on the same frequency, also apparently inbound to PHL. ATC began issuing holding instructions to the aircraft inbound to PHL. Along with holding instructions, ATC was issuing numerous altitude change clearances as aircraft were entering and exiting holding. ATC frequently repeated clearances, due to the number of similar call signs, further congesting an already highly-congested frequency. Cause, the department responsible for assigning flight numbers did not adequately consider the safety implications of numerous similar call signs. Suggestions, the assignment of flight numbers is a function presumably performed within marketing or another department other than flight operations. I strongly believe that flight operations should provide input and coordinate to preclude assignment of similar call signs. The hazard identification and risk assessment process under SMS would be extremely useful in addressing this issue.				Air carrier Captain on arrival into PHL voiced concerns about clearance complications that resulted from multiple flights with similar callsigns.

This took place on Runway 28R and a 767 had just landed before us on Runway 28L.  The wind was 220/20G26 and I believe we encountered some wake turbulence from that 767.

A few seconds later we got a cabin altitude warning horn. The Captain was the first to put on his mask. I stopped the climbing and then donned mine. I was very busy trying to maneuver the aircraft smoothly with the autopilot off and did not immediately establish communications. The Captain advised ATC that we had a pressurization problem and needed to descend. I turned the Pressurization Mode Control switch to MAN and turned the valve switched to CLOSED. Next I set up the flight intercom and advised the Captain of my actions. We requested 8,000 FT and a return. When everything was stable, the Captain noticed the Engine Bleed switches were in the OFF position. We turned the switches ON and Pressurization Mode Controller to AUTO. The aircraft began to pressurize normally. We discussed the fuel status and determined that, from a safety standpoint, there was no obstacles in continuing. We advised ATC of our status and requested on course. We were then cleared en route and continued the flight with no further interruptions. From my perspective, contributing factors in this event were a poor nights sleep and a last minute change of power from standard thrust to 22,000 maximum due to a tailwind component of about 1 knot. I think if I didn't have that power change on my mind I may have noticed the different feel of the pressurization on takeoff. The #1 Flight Attendant was sharp to notify us of the unusual temperature and smell in the cabin. I don't know at what point the engine bleed valves were switched to off or if they were never switched on. The fact that I didn't catch them with the checklist is troubling and will require a good deal of thought and much more vigilance in order to avoid similar problems in the future. It may be worth mentioning that the Cabin Altitude Warning horn went off until the cabin came back to below 10,000 FT. We train to silence the bell when we get a fire warning but it isn't usually discussed for a Cabin Altitude Warning. It didn't occur to me to silence it until it was too late but would have been helpful.		Clearance received at gate by voice due to re-route. Checklists completed and taxi clearance as expected to hold short of Runway 23. Received clearance to 'line up and wait.' Just as I was setting parking brake on runway, First Officer observes slight tailwind. Switching to max 22 KT for tailwind, Tower clears for takeoff. Finishing up getting numbers in place for V speeds, Tower advises they need an immediate roll. Normal takeoff followed. Initial climbout normal, nothing noticed by both pilots. Cabin Altitude Alert warning comes on, so we perform our immediate action items, and with masks on, First Officer smoothly leveled at no more than 12.5 and descended back to 10,000 with Pressurization set to Manual, Outflow Valve to CLOSED did not help. All door lights still out, not having any idea why, I could not keep air in the airplane. I declared an emergency and requested a return. At my request we were given a turning descent to 8,000. I assigned all flying and communicating duties to First Officer so I could talk with Flight Attendants and make PA's. Once done, reaching for QRH, I just sat back and tried to see what was being missed in the 'big picture.' Now reading every switch position on the air and bleed panels, I first noted that the engine bleeds were in the OFF position. Switches were returned to on and all systems returned to normal. Discussed all items with First Officer on resolution, checked fuel for destination, with consideration to weather. We agreed that continuing to our destination was a safe course of action. I felt it necessary to bring Flight Attendants in on this decision, to assure their comfort with this decision and get their opinion on the passengers current condition/reaction to the events. They felt passengers were calm and would be ok. PA was made to assure passengers of aircraft condition. I did acknowledge their concerns. Called Flight Attendants again, and they said all reactions were positive and passengers were happy to be continuing. Informed ATC and they cleared us on route with no further issues. Flight continued without incident. Arrival about 5 minutes behind schedule, but saved nearly 2,000 LBS of fuel. I would like to commend the alertness of my #1 Flight Attendant and willingness to contact the cockpit as soon as he felt something was not right. His long history as a Flight Attendant really shows his knowledge and abilities. He is someone I would like to stay with the Company. Factors for this occurrence for me were as follows: 1) the VERY early departure body clock time. I'm not a morning person. 2) I have about 400 hours on the aircraft all being in the left seat. Having not ever operated as a First Officer in the 737, the air panels are foreign to my hands. When asked in 3 checklists about the packs and bleeds, I looked over every time and saw switches in the 'UP' position, and 'UP' to me is still 'ON.' This is my error. I will read switches next time. Altitude Cutout Horn continued to sound the entire time above 10,000 FT. All training about altitude and cabin at no time were we presented with a situation to press the Cabin Altitude Warning horn cutout. That was a distraction, as one could imagine. I know it is my job to catch the one item that precipitated this situation. Something that may assist prevention of this might be for the maintenance checklists to align with ours so that when they leave they are not shutting off switches we expect to remain in the 'ON' position.		A B737-800 flight crew reported taking off with the Bleed Air Switches CLOSED and above 10,000 FT the cabin altitude warning horn sounded. An emergency declaration was canceled and the flight continued to its destination after the bleed switches were OPENED.

We saw the traffic on the TCAS, then got an RA descend, we noticed the aircraft was descending through our altitude and complied with the RA and descended to around 14000 FT and came within 400 FT of the traffic directly over head of us. I tried to call Center but it was busy and could not get a reply, then finally got through and let them know we descended on a RA and returning to our assigned altitude of 15000 FT. I ask why that aircraft descended through our altitude and the Controller replied that that aircraft was on a STAR and didn't know why but would look into it.		We followed standard operating procedures, which resulted in a successful outcome.		A B737 crew at 15,000 FT on a departure reported responding to a TCAS RA from an aircraft descending on a STAR to an airport different from their departure airport.

At 10,000 feet Flight Attendants said ovens were not working.  Checked and cycled both galley switches power ON and OFF.  Asked the Flight Attendants if the breakers were in and they were.  Immediately called Maintenance Control and they said sounds like load shed.  That is when I noticed the Gen Bus lights.  Changed switched position and continued normally.  I take responsibility for the mistake and obviously during the checklist I answered that the generators were ON when, in fact, they were not.  I would like to think that I have excellent checklist discipline because I insist on checklist precision and even brief that when I start a new flight segment.  So I have to dig deep slow down and pay more attention.  No other action taken and flight continue normally to destination.  One factor that the First Officer and I discussed is the intensity of the lights and ambient outside sunlight made viewing the lights difficult even when looking directly at the lights.  We both thought that we had looked at the lights and even double checked.  Even looking near that area where the galley power switches are located we both did not notice the lights.  Again were pointed directly into a setting sun and the light was directly in the forward windscreen.  There is no warning for taking off in this configuration and that probably should be designed into the aircraft.  This might be so because there is auto switching should the APU be shutdown in this configuration.  Bottom line this is my error and a crew error and vigilance and slowing down are the solution.				A B737 Captain reported that the aircraft took off with both buses on the APU generator. The Pilots did not see the generator lights' status because the sun's brightness overwhelmed the relatively dim electrical panel lights.

The runway was wet - the ceiling and visibility were low - LGA Tower was simultaneously utilizing Runway 13/31.  Prepared for a possible missed approach/go-around in the event someone incurred onto 'our' landing runway or if the visibility/ceiling were to be lower than advertised - I had my fingers very close to the TO/GA Buttons. Upon reaching minimums I disconnected the AFCS (Autopilot) and subsequently attempted to disconnect the autothrust only to realize the throttles advancing and the nose beginning to pitch up due to the low slung engines - I also immediately realized the command bars and speed tape readjusting for the TO/GA Mode. Without further delay and having 1 to 2 seconds of either correcting the issue or properly executing a missed approach I immediately disconnected the autothrust - released back pressure enough to get back to glidepath but not too much to set off a SINKRATE Warning and landed safely in the touchdown zone well prior to my 'preset' go around point on LGA's short (and wet) pavement.  [I] stopped aircraft well prior to Runway 13/31 Intersection. The pilot not flying realized what was occurring at time nose was pitching up (saw the correction) and briefed issue after landing. So no action or intervention was required from the pilot not flying.Event occurred because in my mind I was so preoccupied with the Go Around/Missed Approach possibility that I was fixated on the TO/GA Buttons; when in reality I should have looked at the big picture and realized the consequences of accidentally pressing the TO/GA Buttons when I am not supposed to. An unnecessary go-around could have ensued in the busy New York Airspace with marginal weather conditions. In ground school and in the simulator training discuss this issue with students so someone else does not experience this type of occurrence. This can apparently happen to anyone of low or high experience. Understanding the automation and what happens when the wrong things are selected at the wrong time is key to avoiding such issues.				B737 First Officer reports inadvertently selecting TO/GA after a low visibility approach to minimums while attempting to disconnect autothrust. The error was quickly corrected and a safe landing ensued.

Out of approximately 4,000 FT the First Officer called, 'Autopilot on'.  At 6,000 FT we saw that the aircraft was not leveling and the First Officer manually corrected.

When the First Officer called out 'autopilot on,' neither one of us confirmed that the PFD display changed from F/D to CMD.  So the autopilot was not engaged.		I disengaged the autopilot and noticed the warning horn didn't go off. Even though I selected the autopilot and looked at the FMA, I did not notice that it never engaged.

The MEL's were: 34-20 No 2 Radio Altimeter, 34-12 No 2 Flight Director, and 32-27 PSEU System.  The original logbook discrepancy was for a spurious 'Minimums/Minimums' automated callout.  The ME'Ls resulted in higher weather minimums for the aircraft.  (The A/C was downgraded to CAT I only, no lower than 4000 feet or 3/4 mile visibility.)  We flew the aircraft and at touchdown, the 'Minimums/Minimums' callout occurred.  After arriving at the gate, the First Officer and I discussed the existing MEL's and felt that we were okay to continue.  We thought the intent of the MEL's were to prevent us from being distracted by the spurious callout in a low weather, low altitude situation by setting higher approach minimums.  We continued on to our next destination.  On the next flight, the First Officer and I further discussed the MEL's.  We realized that we didn't know if the deferrals were actually intended to prevent any further callouts form occurring.  If that was the intent of Maintenance Control with the MEL's, further maintenance and or deferrals were needed.  Upon arrival at our next destination, the callout occurred again.  I contacted Maintenance Control and talked with the Contract Mechanic.  With the version of software on this new aircraft, the answer was unclear.  The Contract Mechanic thought the callout was normal.  The Maintenance Controller decided the GPWS system needed to be deactivated to silence the automated callouts.  At this point it was still unclear whether we violated any FARs.  After doing more research with Maintenance Control, they told me that this automated callout would be standard on all aircraft {tail number} onward.  Determine if these automated callouts should or should not occur.  Either de-activate them or publish guidance for Flight Crews to use if the callout will be standard on our new aircraft.		Upon arrival, the callout occurred again.  We contacted Maintenance Control and also talked with the Contract Maintenance Mechanic.  It seemed that there was no general agreement among them as to whether this automated callout was normal.  The Mechanic said he thought it was, but Maintenance Control said it wasn't.  In the end, it was decided that the GPWS system should also be deactivated and deferred to definitely silence these automated callouts.  This was done.		B737-700 Flight Crew reports accepting an aircraft with MEL's to deal with a spurious 'Minimums Minimums' automated callout. On the first landing the callouts occur. Maintenance Control is unsure if the MEL actions were meant to silence the callouts or even if they are anomalous or just part of a software upgrade in newer aircraft.

We saw cloud visually, as well as on radar, painting some red in the cloud.  The pilot not flying and I discussed and agreed to deviate left (north) of course, for weather avoidance.  Three or four times the pilot not flying tried to contact ABQ Center for permission to deviate, with no reply from ABQ.  Meanwhile, the frequency was a bit busy with other aircraft checking in, and ABQ Center issuing weather advisories.  Faced with the choice of penetrating a cloud returning red echoes, and deviating without clearance from ATC, we opted to choose what we felt was the safest option and deviated left for a short time.  We assumed the pilot not flying's radio was dead, so the pilot flying tried to contact ATC with no answer.  [We] finally got a hand off from ATC to new frequency which the pilot flying answered.  Upon checking in with new ATC frequency we advised ATC of our deviation, and that we were returning on course.  At about this time, we realized the pilot not flying's microphone jack had come disconnected, and that's why ATC could not hear us.				A320 First Officer reports lost communications with ABQ Center and deviates without clearance to avoid weather. It is later discovered that the Captain's microphone jack had come unplugged causing the outage.

We had a Fuel Imbalance EICAS message appear. The right main fuel total was decreasing 100 LBS every 2 seconds until it reached an indication of 59.0 LBS. At the time, the engines were still feeding off the center tank and it had approximately 14.0 LBS indicated. Fuel checks prior to this had been accurate and a check of the Calculated Engine burn was in line with the flight plan. We turned the autopilot off to check the lateral balance of the aircraft and no discrepancy in balance what-so-ever was noticed. We then opened the Maintenance Fuel Quantity display on the lower EICAS and noted that fuel probe 18 in the right tank showed a value of .9 while fuel probe 18 in the left tank had a value of 12.6. We also noted that fuel probe 19 in the right main tank, which we assumed was at a higher level physically in the tank, had a value of 11.1 and was in line with the value indicated on probe 19 in the left tank. We called Dispatch through SATCOM and had them patch us to Maintenance Control to see if there was any history on this and have them query the aircraft to see what they could tell was going on with the aircraft. Tech reported that the aircraft had recently had a history of fuel indication problems with the right tank and 2 tank probes had recently been changed however, probe 18 was not one of the problem probes that had been changed. They also reported that a query of the aircraft indicated a right fuel probe error. We discussed that the location of the fuel probe 18 and the resulting total fuel indication of 59.0 for that tank seemed logical that the system wasn't reading anything above probe 17. We also discussed that as the fuel was used out of the right main tank that the system should return to normal once the level got below the probe in error. During this discussion the fuel quantity in the right main tank returned to an indication of 62.5 and after a short time again decreased to 59.0 at a rate of 100 LBS per 2 seconds. Confident that we only had a fuel indication problem, and had not lost any quantity of fuel, I made the decision to continue the flight as planned. I also made the decision to not run the Fuel Imbalance checklist that was called for as it was inappropriate for the problem we were encountering. Once the right main tank fuel quantity was reduced to a level below the probe in error, the fuel indication system returned to normal, our fuel burn and quantity was in line with the expectation of our flight plan progress sheet and no other discrepancies were noted for the remainder of the flight.				A B777's fuel quantity indication began decreasing unexpectedly during cruise. The Crew's troubleshooting and discussion with Maintenance Control determined that several fuel quantity probes in the effected tank were malfunctioning but as fuel burned quantity would become accurate.

In the departure city, the 'B' Flight Attendant smelled an odor from the aft lavatory.  It was confirmed by all Crew Members.  The intensity of the odor was slightly less in the front lavatory than in the aft.  I asked Maintenance to make sure everything was okay.  He said he was unsure exactly what the smell was.  It was then determined to possibly be in the tank which is shared by both lavatories.  We were given the okay to proceed.  About two thirds of the way into the flight, the A Flight Attendant informed me the smell was giving the B and C Flight Attendants headaches.  She recommended having Maintenance investigate the odor.  Starting the initial descent (about 230 NM), I was informed that the B Flight Attendant vomited.  I asked if she was okay to continue or if we needed to divert.  She said she was okay to continue.  I later suggested keeping her away from the smell as much as possible.  As we started the Arrival, I received a call that the B Flight Attendant collapsed, and the EMS Team was requested at the gate.  After coordinating with Operations, the Flight Attendant collapsed again.  While this was happening, a medical emergency was being declared.  Upon arrival, the Flight Attendant was removed from the aircraft and the EMS Team took a toxicity test.  They said the odor was negative for anything toxic.  Maintenance also met the aircraft.  I had a face-to-face about the odor and he said he would investigate it.  I didn't make an entry in the logbook, because I didn't think an odor in the lavatory tank warranted one.				B737-700 Flight Attendants report a strong odor in the lavatories prior to departure but Maintenance cannot find the cause. Enroute the Flight Attendants experience headaches and one Flight Attendant vomits. A medical emergency is declared for landing at destination airport.

Since a flap 15 landing was needed and OAT at airport was around 33C we just sat off the end of the runway for approximately 30 minutes while brakes cooled and then taxied to gate. With a planned arrival fuel load of 6.8, fuel was not a large concern, but would have added an additional problem if planned fuel had been much lower. As it was we arrived at the gate with a fuel of 4.7.				A B737-800's LE Flap Transit light was illuminated as the aircraft was prepared for landing.

His estimated the range to us was approximately one to one and one half miles and his altitude was approximately 700' AGL. I would estimate our altitude at the time to be about 1400' AGL and descending. As I checked in with OAK Tower, I stated I had traffic ahead in sight and then noticed the Cessna was still climbing. The OAK Tower issued a Traffic Advisory and then cleared us to land. About the same time, the TCAS issued a 'Climb, Climb' command. The First Officer disconnected the autopilot and complied with the TA. My best guess is that we climbed about 200'-300' and missed the climbing Cessna by about 300' vertically. Laterally, I believe he was right below us. After the 'Clear of Conflict' was issued, we continued the visual approach to a normal landing. ATC stated that the Cessna had violated his altitude clearance climbing out of Hayward Airport and was being tracked down. I was told to call OAK Tower on arrival and did so at the gate. The Tower Chief asked my opinion as to how close we thought we had passed the Cessna. I relayed to him the same information as stated above. Maybe the Tower Controllers at Hayward and Oakland could better coordinate air traffic so departing Hayward traffic is timed to not interfere with arriving OAK traffic. This way, a conflict would not develop with a single failure, e.g., a missed altitude clearance would not lead to a conflict or a near miss.				An air carrier Captain reported an NMAC on approach to OAK when his flight path conflicted with a light aircraft off HWD who was reportedly deviating from his clearance.

It was VMC on the field, there were lots of building rain showers north painting on the radar, but causing no adverse conditions to arriving aircraft. We were at 3000 FT MSL on a 220 heading to join the Localizer and expecting to break out of clouds shortly after the initial approach fix. The Captain was the pilot flying and had heading selected on the MCP/FMA and VOR/LOC armed on both the MCP and FMA. Neither the Flight Director nor autopilot captured the Localizer. The Captain initiated a turn back to the Localizer simultaneously with Approach giving us a call to turn to a 150 heading to intercept XXL. Both the FD and autopilot again failed to capture the final. As Approach called to tell us we were again going through final, we asked for a vector out to a box pattern to rejoin and Approach complied. We rechecked our set up, but found nothing out of the ordinary. As we were re-vectored, the same thing occurred. The Captain disconnected the autopilot and hand-flew the ILS to an uneventful full stop. As expected, we broke out about 2200 FT MSL. On the final, we noticed the Captain's FMA indicated Heading selected (green) VOR/LOC armed (white), and G/S (glideslope) captured (green). The First Officer's FMA indicated both VOR/LOC and G/S captured (green). Additionally, while on final, we could not manually disconnect heading on the MCP. It was very strange. Maintenance determined the Captain's ILS was bad and MEL'd it. Personally, I am not sure this was the problem. There was definitely a computer glitch somewhere. I was very happy with our coordination on final as well as the decision to depart the approach and get a box pattern to figure out what was going on.		We were on a heading of 220 degrees to intercept the Localizer at 3000 FT and were cleared for the approach. The 'A' autopilot CMD (Configuration Management Directive) was on, heading mode was engaged, and VOR/LOC was armed. I called localizer alive, but noticed the FD and autopilot failed to intercept the Localizer. We started a left turn for the Localizer, and then Approach Control gave us a heading of 150 degrees to intercept the Localizer. Again, the 'A' autopilot CMD was on, heading mode was engaged, and VOR/LOC was armed. The FD and A/P failed to intercept the Localizer. We requested a vector to intercept the Localizer again. The Captain's FMA showed VOR/LOC and G/S armed. The Localizer never captured, but G/S did. The First Officer's FMA showed VOR/LOC and G/S captured. I could not manually deselect Heading on the MCP. I disengaged the autopilot and hand-flew the visual approach. Disengaging the autopilot and hand-flying the approach was the proper thing to do. Also, after determining the First Officer's FD was operating normally, if autopilot was needed, we could have used the autopilot		A B737-700's was programmed to capture an ILS from the CMD heading mode. The FMA and MCP indicated VOR/LOC armed but the autopilot would not transition from the HDG mode to the ILS Capture mode.

The cockpit duties were then divided with First Officer continuing to fly the aircraft and Captain handling the ECAM. The ECAM directed a recycling of the gear, which was done. Shortly thereafter, we received another gear not uplocked ECAM, followed by HYD G Engine Pump Lo PR. Captain selected the green pump off per the ECAM and noticed a decreasing quantity on the green hydraulic quantity indicator on the hydraulic schematic. At this time, we were talking to Departure and received clearance to climb to 7000 feet. As we were climbing out of 3000 feet, we received another ECAM - HYD PTU Fault. Per the ECAM, Captain turned off the PTU. We realized that continuing to destination was not a possibility with the gear still down and the loss of green hydraulics and informed Departure that we would be returning. First Officer put on the autopilot at this point to accommodate the division of duties. We received a southerly vector and leveled off at 5000 feet. We did not declare an emergency at this time. The Flight Attendants called us to let us know they still heard the gear down. Captain then informed our Flight Attendant that we had hydraulic issues and issued a cabin advisory. Captain also informed the passengers about a hydraulic malfunction and the return. Then we had another ECAM - HYD Y ELEC PUMP OVHT, followed by the autopilot disconnecting. First Officer continued to hand-fly the aircraft while Captain declared an emergency with Approach and addressed the Y OVHT ECAM. The yellow engine pump was then selected off per the ECAM. The Flight Attendants were then instructed to prepare the cabin for evacuation. Approach set us up with the longest runway. Emergency equipment was requested and a tug to clear us from the runway (with Dispatch) due to the loss of nose wheel steering. Since we were down to one hydraulic system and overweight (by 13,000 pounds), we consulted with Dispatch and Maintenance about the recovery of the yellow hydraulic system (as indicated in the irregular procedure). About 15 miles form the field the yellow hydraulic system was reselected on and was successfully restored. Captain coordinated with Dispatch for a tug and also requested landing performance data from Dispatch with the loss of green hydraulics. Captain also reviewed the landing distance abnormal or irregular configuration, whereby it was determined that with the yellow system back and normal landing configuration, a mostly normal landing could be made (except for the overweight status and alternate brakes). The prep for evacuation was canceled, but the cabin advisory remained. Checklists were referred to and accomplished (all of the above ECAMS and the overweight landing checklist) as well as normal checklists. Captain took control of the aircraft at about 1500 feet and landed the aircraft. The aircraft was brought to a stop straight ahead on the runway. It was not convenient to clear the runway without any nose wheel steering. Fire vehicles met us on the runway, and airport operations communicated with us from there. We shut down the engines, and indicated to the firemen that the brakes were set. They inspected the landing gear and informed us that there was a hydraulic leak in the left gear well area. The left brakes were then heating up, and we informed the Flight Attendants of a possibility of evacuation due to the leak with brake temperatures increasing and to stay alert. Passengers were informed to remain seated. The firemen were also requested to chalk the aircraft so we could release the brake to increase cooling, and they also got fans. The brakes finally peaked around 580 degrees then started cooling. Eventually a tug came out to tow us to the gate.				An A320 flight crew experienced the failure of landing gear to retract completely after takeoff followed shortly by a HYD G Engine Pump LO PR ECAM. The flight returned safely to the departure airport and was towed to the gate due to lack of steering.

We briefed a visual approach to Runway 24, but the First Officer queried Approach Control about our routing through the thunderstorms on our path to Runway 24. Approach Control then said the wind had changed and was a direct crosswind. They suggested a visual approach to Runway 6. All passengers and Flight Attendants had been seated since 14,000 FT. We turned to the assigned heading of 220, then 240, and then 270 to go between thunderstorms and get on the west side of RSW for the visual to Runway 6. On these various headings, we were constantly changing our scale settings on the weather radar to give us the best picture of getting through the weather. At one time, just before breaking out in visual conditions, I saw the representation of RSW off my left side while on about the twenty mile scale. After breaking out of the weather at about 3000 FT, the Approach Controller called out the airport at about our 7-8 o'clock position and (I think) five-seven miles. I looked over my left shoulder and told the First Officer I had the airport, and he notified Approach Control who sent us over to the Tower. At this time, the First Officer could not see the airport that I had seen (it turned out to be the Page airport). I should have realized that the airport representation I saw on the radar was closer than I had seen before. This was only the second time I had flown into RSW. We overshot the final to the Page airport and (as I was correcting back to line up on final), the First Officer told me that the airport we were lining up for was not RSW. It was at this time that I noticed that the localizer was not lined up, and it further indicated to me we were not on final to Runway 6 at RSW. I looked to my right, saw the RSW airport, and turned to about a 180-degree heading. I calculated we were no closer than about five to six miles from the Page airport when we corrected. From a heading of 180, we reconfigured to flaps 15 and proceeded to enter a left base for Runway 6 at RSW. Even though we were on the Tower frequency for RSW, we were never asked about our alignment with the Page airport. One of the reasons was (I think), they were trying to get as many departures out as they could before the storms came over the airport, and there were low level windshear [alerts] on the airport for Runway 6. Some aircraft were reporting gains and losses of 20 KTS. We got a 20-knot gain at about 200 FT AGL, but our landing was normal and the taxi to the gate was uneventful. The flight ended normally and we were never asked by ATC about our initial heading to Page airport. Our scheduled departure was delayed about sixty minutes for severe weather all across central Florida.		While approaching RSW for a visual approach, we had circled around a big thunderstorm to be in position for a visual approach to Runway 6. The Captain was flying. When we broke out of the clouds, he said that he had the field in sight. I saw generally where it was at, but did not see the runway. The Captain was flying and had it in sight so I reported it in sight to Approach Control.We were then cleared for the visual to Runway 6 and told to contact the Tower. I did and we were cleared to land on Runway 6. Not seeing the airport, I was looking to see where the Captain was flying. He called for configuration changes and I accomplished them. When I finally saw the runway he was descending to, I realized that it was not RSW.I said, 'That's not it.' We immediately turned towards RSW. We were about 1800 FT. We told the Tower that we were aiming at the wrong airport, but we had Runway 6 at RSW in sight. The field we were headed towards was Page Field. We flew within about five miles and 1800 FT of it. We landed at RSW and taxied to the gate.		An Air Carrier Flight Crew, deviating around significant weather, lined up for Page airport instead of the intended RSW.  The error was identified by the First Officer and a normal landing at RSW followed.

Autopilot and autothrottles were engaged and using VNAV procedures. Passing FAF checked speed below 200 KTS and called for gear down and flaps 15. Checked speed below 190 and called for flaps 25. Checked speed below 175 and called for flaps 30 followed by flaps 40 when speed below 162. I noticed it took an unusually long time for the speed to bleed below 162. Then noted that the auto speed bug was still indicating flaps 25 speed and noted the flaps were still indicating 25 degrees. Reselected flap handle to flaps 25 position momentarily and then back to flaps 40 position. Flaps remained indicating 25 degrees. Executed a missed approach and due to our low fuel state elected an immediate divert to [a nearby airport] for flaps 15 landing. Landed normally using flaps 15 landing procedures. This aircraft had two previous flap problem write-ups and flap maintenance had been performed on this aircraft prior to the previous leg. Aircraft was signed off after this event as could not duplicate (on ground). Upon review of the flap load relief system, I believe the system on this airplane may be malfunctioning causing a flap lockout at higher than intended speeds. Check the load relief system on this aircraft.			Reporter stated aircraft type is B737NG.	A B737NG Flight Crew reported problems with their flap load relief system on approach, leading to a deviation to a nearby airport with a longer runway.

Contacted Maintenance Control and they suggested a procedure which only allows a reset on the ground. Neither pilot was willing to attempt a FMGC reset while airborne with potential random results. Advised ATC we had a frozen display and could follow the arrival route in heading. We were able to select VOR's and ILS' if necessary in standby mode. Asked ATC to follow our progress and if any deviations were noted to advise us. ATC was not busy and did not indicate they had any concerns with our request. Captain offered that if any deviations or problems arose that he would declare an emergency; also noted that if a go-around became necessary that declaring an emergency would be immediate. ATC provided vectors to final intercept. Weather was night VFR. Airport was acquired early. FMGC's auto tuned the field VOR and correctly tuned and ID'd the ILS as the anticipated arrival runway was the one we used on arrival.

Visible condensation was present coming from all vents onboard the aircraft. I stopped the boarding process. The ECAM subsequently disappeared. No action was taken as all conditions were normal.  Takeoff and departure were normal. At approximately 9000 FT we received a LAND ASAP message with no accompanying ECAM. The First Officer continued to fly as I researched the problem. When RCL (recall) was selected the Avionics Smoke ECAM was visible. No smoke was present in the cockpit or cabin (Flight Attendant's were contacted). We leveled off and began to return to MMUN. After a brief discussion we decided the ECAM was left over from the ground visible condensation condition. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to confirm the false LAND ASAP message referenced in the Flight Manual. With concurrence from Maintenance and Dispatch I used Captain's emergency authority to cycle the following circuit breakers as per Flight Manual guidance: FWC 1 SUPLY, FWC 2 SUPLY. The reset was successful and all indications returned to normal. I requested a new flight plan from VITAR Intersection with 25.0 FOB (fuel on board) to ensure FAR fuel was still on board. The flight proceeded without further incident. I have been told by our Dispatcher that this is a recurring situation in humid, tropical destinations. The procedure is in our Flight Manual. I am not sure why Captain's emergency authority must be used to solve a known system fault. Perhaps this needs to be addressed in a future Flight Manual revision.		On departure crew got a 'Land ASAP' message. A phone patch was conducted with Maintenance, Dispatch and the flight. Crew followed the guidance in the Flight Manual for a 'false LAND ASAP message' with Dispatch and Maintenance concurrence.

Five miles later, as we were reaching 10,000 feet, the Controller asked our altitude. She mentioned we were supposed to be there a few miles ago. I think if ATC is going to change any of the Descend Via [clearance] and not allow you to just fly it as published, they should revert to altitude and airspeed directives. I also believe I won't be retyping altitudes on arrivals just using the airspeed override button.				A B737 Captain arriving PHX on the GEELA 2 was instructed to delete the speed restrictions. An altitude deviation, that was noted by the Controller, was the result of an FMC programing error.

On initial approach ATC gave us a 'box' pattern vector which put us at 4400lbs of fuel. We asked to not delay us any more due to fuel constraints and they replied that no more delays were anticipated. We began the approach with 3300lbs of fuel. On a ten mile final we were given go around instructions due to the aircraft in front of us going too slow. We began an immediate turn to SJC, but they told us to keep the turn going and would get us in immediately after we declared minimum fuel. We turned around and landed on Runway 28L. As we were in the turn back to the Runway the low fuel ECAM came on. This event did occur, as with most incidents, because of a multiple chain of events. The winds were higher than planned, and then we had to contend with weather that was heavy to extreme precipitation. We went around it to the south which took more time and fuel. As a crew we decided to continue and talked about our plans along each step of the way. The more we got into the SFO approach area; we told the controllers that we could not accept any delays, never saying MIN FUEL. They told us not to worry and would not have any issues. As we got vectored around we discussed that we would only attempt one approach and then on to SJC. We declared minimum fuel after the aircraft was under control as we were pulled off the approach. They gave us a 270 back to final. At that time the low fuel light came on and land ASAP annunciated. We discussed quickly that we would land this time since we did not have any other options left. After being able to sit back and replay our situation in our minds the Captain and I came to an agreement. In the future we would not hesitate to declare an emergency to get us to airport and on the ground. We were keeping up with our fuel burn, winds, and had asked Dispatch to run the new numbers for us with the route change etc. We asked Approach if we would have any issues on final and that we could not take any delays. I have made a set of guidelines for me in the future... For example: less than forty five minutes of fuel remaining must declare 'min fuel' and less than thirty minutes you must declare an emergency as per our Operating Manual. We were aware of our situation along the entire route of the flight and the information we were given led us to believe we would not have any fuel issues, but as it played out and changes popped up at us, we dealt with it as a team.				An A320 First Officer reported that after arriving in the SFO area after an excessive transcontinental fuel burn they were given delaying vectors and a go around. As they entered the final approach the LOW FUEL LAND ASAP ECAM annunciated. They did not declare an emergency.

We quickly donned our masks and established communications with each other as per the procedures. I commanded to stop the climb and proceeded to accomplish the checklist items per the QRH. All appeared to be in the proper positions (packs, bleed air, Company and Controller mode). The outflow valve was at a midpoint position and the cabin was at aircraft altitude. I moved the controller to manual and then attempted to move the outflow valve, initially in the wrong direction by mistake, and then to close position. We noted no movement either way. We were cleared to 10,000 feet and we removed our masks. I asked for a clearance back and did not declare an emergency. I felt that all we now had was an event of a non-pressurized aircraft that did not warrant trucks or priority handling. We were vectored for a thirty NM final and accomplished a normal arrival.I do not know why this happened but I do have a few afterthought suggestions. In a scenario such as this I would suggest always declaring the emergency. You would still get all the vectors and time you would need, but it may help relieve the pressures of traffic surveillance a bit. Instead of looking up the frequency for ILS, I should have just asked. If the aircraft has the capability, always keep the ILS frequency for the return on one side of one Crew Member NAV control box. Donning O2 masks during recurrent training should be done from the sitting position with the headset on (glasses too, if used for flight) so as to experience the reality of the item interference.		After departing and climbing through 10,500 feet, we experienced an abnormal pressurization event. The Cabin Altitude Warning horn sounded as we passed approximately 10,500 feet climbing to FL 190. We responded to the warning horn and performed Crew actions by both pilots donning O2 masks and establishing communication each other.I was the Pilot Flying. I stopped the climb at approximately 11,000 feet while we alerted ATC of the event and asked for a lower altitude. We descended below 10,000 feet, got vectors to return, performed a normal landing and returned to the gate.		A B737 Flight Crew experienced a cabin altitude warning horn passing 10000 feet during climb. Attempts to regain control of cabin pressurization were unsuccessful. Flight returned to the departure airport.

The first day we flew all -300s, the second day we flew all -500s, and today we were to fly a -700 all day.  We discussed how nice it was going to be to have the 'full up' -700.Everything was normal during takeoff and cleanup.  Shortly after we checked in, Departure said to turn right, proceed direct [WAYPOINT X] and climb to 14,000' due to traffic.  At this time, my First Officer was in the Heading mode and manually flying the aircraft so I brought [WAYPOINT X] to the top of the FMC, had him verify it, executed it, and selected LNAV.  Then I selected 14,000??? and he verified it.We were in the weather at this time, so I looked at my map display to see if there were any potential traffic conflicts.  About this time, I heard my F/O say autopilot is on and we broke out through the clouds in a right turn.  I looked around for any aircraft, didn't see any, and then noticed we were turning toward the mountains north of ONT. We were still climbing at 210 KIAS and passing about 8000'.  I remember thinking it was a good thing we had such a good climb rate (with the mountains at our 12 o'clock) when my First Officer said he didn't have a flight director.I looked inside at my display and saw we were turning through about 020 heading.  [WAYPOINT X] was back to the left at about a 290-degree heading (I expected about a 340 heading).  I told him to turn back to the left and immediately called Departure to report we had turned past [WAYPOINT X] and were correcting back.  Naturally that call got stepped on, and his call to us got stepped on, but we finally communicated that we turned past [WAYPOINT X] and were correcting back.About this time, my First Officer said he didn't see [WAYPOINT X] and he wasn't sure where we were headed.  I looked at my display again and he had turned past [WAYPOINT X] to the left.  We got him turning back to [WAYPOINT X] and I noticed that his display didn't have a magenta line.  About this time, we both realized the autopilot wasn't connected and he never disconnected it.  He selected the B autopilot, but it didn't engage.  I selected the A autopilot and it engaged.We were trying to figure out what was going on with the displays and autopilot when I noticed he was in APPR not the MAP display.  (He had gone to APPR when checking the VOR during the pre takeoff checks and left it there.)   After we got an autopilot engaged, got his MAP display up and verified everything worked fine.  We later selected the B autopilot.  It engaged and worked fine the rest of the flight.As we have all heard a hundred times or more, both Pilots need to observe any MCP changes and then make sure the scoreboard on the display shows the proper mode. I got distracted by the traffic call and then looking at the mountain at our 12 o'clock position. My F/O was probably doing the same thing and didn't notice the autopilot hadn't engaged. I'm sure he then got distracted by the fact he couldn't see [WAYPOINT X] on his ND. No excuses, but that's what happened. I will try to be extra vigilant in the future.		I need to be more vigilant about checking the FMA after engaging the A/P to ensure it is doing what I expect.		A B737-700 flight crew suffered a track deviation when the PF left his ND in the APPR mode rather than MAP and thus had no active route display to follow.

Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the aircraft banked approx 25-30 degrees right, then went about 20 degrees left. The autopilot did not disengage, but I disengaged it manually and maintained level flight with aileron input only. After both pilots confirmed that all flight computers were functioning normally, I re-engaged the autopilot. All flight phases were uneventful after I re-engaged the autopilot. Everything was functioning normally. It was at this time that the First Officer (pilot not flying) noticed a spiraling shaped vortex at our flight level. To me, it looked like wing tip vortices. It was there momentarily, and, after a brief discussion, we determined the vortex to possibly be some wake turbulence (like one would see on final approach or while observing landing aircraft) from another aircraft. I then made an announcement to the passengers about our circumstance, and then I talked with the Chief Purser on their experiences in the passenger compartment. Though everyone was startled, all Flight Attendants were OK as well as all of the passengers. There were no reports of any injuries, though I was told one woman in the back was crying. As turbulence is a 'part of the job' and because no passenger or Flight Attendant was injured, both pilots decided that a report was unnecessary for this incident. In retrospect, I believe I should have informed ATC and asked if there were any large/heavy aircraft near our plane that may have caused our temporary problem with their wake, but we did not elect to do this. Finally, I made it a point to go out in the cabin during deplaning to address any passenger concerns or questions. I received no negative comments about our flight, only praise.		At cruise we encountered an uncommanded roll to the left and then a roll to the right of approximately 30 degrees of bank. It was the Captain's leg so he grabbed the side-stick and disconnected the autopilot. The airplane corrected back to level attitude. At this time I noticed the remnants of a contrail just above our altitude. It was parallel to our flight path. We did have traffic pass over us in opposite direction minutes before the incident. I also noted a direct tailwind of 50 KTS. The roll was abrupt enough to cause a coffee pot to fall of a serving cart in the back. No injuries were reported. We figured it must have been wake turbulence but could not be certain.		An A320 Flight Crew reported a probable wake turbulence encounter at FL370 that resulted in significant uncommanded roll in both directions. The crew reported what appeared to be spiral-shaped wing tip votices at their flight level.

After autopilot captured LOC, APP mode was armed to capture glideslope with flaps 5, speed approximately 180 KTS. Glideslope captured and initially appeared to track normally. Aircraft then began to oscillate in pitch and rapidly descended below glideslope. Autopilot was disconnected and aircraft was manually returned to glideslope, during which time ATC issued alert to check altitude. It is unclear whether this malfunction was associated with the positioning of the VHF NAV transfer switch as it relates to the MEL item, but all ILS information is from the #1 receiver only in this configuration. According to the MEL, this configuration is normal and acceptable unless HUD CAT II or CAT III approaches are conducted. To the best of my knowledge, this issue did not involve crew error or procedural deviation.				A B737-800 was dispatched with a single VOR. While conducting a coupled CAT I ILS, the aircraft oscillated rapidly at glide slope capture and descended below the glide slope. The autopilot was disconnected and aircraft control returned to normal.

When we took position for takeoff we asked if the runway had been grooved. Tower said it had not, but it was planned for the future. This time of the year it basically rains every afternoon in MIA. This has significance for a 737 takeoff since we are to use maximum thrust if the runway is wet and non-grooved. Also, I would think being non-grooved would affect abort capabilities and landing performance. The non-grooved nature of Runway 8L does not appear on the ATIS or field notes for MIA. Nor does the time table for installing grooves. I believe the non-grooved nature of the runway was a recent factor in a recent accident. With the tempo of operations at MIA and the rainy season, this is a significant safety issue. Include the non-grooved nature of runway in ATIS, field notes, and special messages until situation is resolved.				A B737 First Officer reported that MIA does not report the ungrooved condition of the newly paved Runway 8L. B737's are required to do full power takeoff's on wet and ungrooved runways. However, without NOTAMs or other notice methods crew will not know the runways groove statue.

Approximately an hour and a half later the cabin reported the smell had returned. I exercised my emergency authority for a precautionary diversion to a nearby airport. I did not declare an emergency however. The approach and landing where hurried but uneventful. Maintenance inspected the aircraft and could not find any problems. As a precaution the TV system was place on placard. I suspect that the smell was associated with a personnel electronic device of some sort. It was also thought that we may have been over weight on landing. That was entered in the book as well. The aircraft was signed off and we continued to our scheduled without further drama.				An A320 Captain exercised his emergency authority and diverted to an enroute airport after flight attendants reported a hot odor in the aft cabin but could not identify a specific source.

I tried arming the approach and that didn't work either.  The mechanic who came to address the issue said it was a known problem and occurred because of the return to blocks.  This could have been extremely dangerous if this occurred in IMC and fuel or mechanical problems were also being dealt with.  Why doesn't my Air Carrier: 1. train us properly on the new FMGEC's (Flight Management Guidance Envelope Computer) and 2. not inform the pilots of KNOWN problems that we may encounter?	The reporter believes that the problems that he has encountered can be traced to the new FMGEC's that the company is installing in their Airbus fleet.  The upgrade is primarily concerned with increased memory capability but also has some quirks that the company is aware of but has not conveyed to the Crew's.  This is the second instance that the reporter has encountered where the flight guidance did not perform as expected during an ILS approach.			A320 Captain reports problems with the new FMGEC's that are being retrofitted into the fleet.  On two separate occasions the FMGEC would not give proper flight director guidance to fly ILS approaches.

I had requested a route uplink in the FMC while on the ground. It never arrived until after we were airborne. The First Officer was flying the SID with LNAV engaged, when we received the route uplink. Immediately after executing the uplink, the FMC dropped out a portion of the SID navigation data. While I began to re-program, ATC said to fly a heading of 160 degrees. After another vector, I advised him that we had lost some navigation data. It was obvious after the event that my error was in activating any executable FMC data at a low altitude while flying a SID, although in no way did I anticipate that we would lose any FMC navigation ability. There was not any communication from Departure Control indicating that our track interfered with any other traffic. The flight continued normally to destination, and no problems suspected with the reliability of the aircraft navigation equipment.		I was on a 777 taking off. Ground Operations was uneventful, except for a lagging ACARS system. After a reset, the ACARS system seemed to be working normally. I was the pilot flying. We were cleared the departure and the FMC was programmed correctly for this departure. Within a few seconds after liftoff, the FMC announced with a loud chime that the route was ready to load. This must have been a delayed request from the earlier datalink communication (ACARS) problem on the ground. I assumed that the Captain would simply ignore the chime and message, as it was not critical to the phase of flight. However, the Captain decided to hit 'LOAD' without fully considering the ramifications or consulting me. In the blink of an eye, the loaded FMC departure was wiped clean with only the first fix installed from the route load. As the pilot flying, I continued to hand fly, although in retrospect, I should have turned on the autopilot immediately to assist in regaining our navigational capabilities. The Captain, in the meantime, was trying furiously to reload the departure, since it was wiped clean with the 'LOAD' command. Upon each attempt to reload the departure, the FMC would command an incorrect right turn to the first assigned fix when the departure was clearly depicting a left turn starting at 14 DME from the VOR. We never figured out why this was so, but I suppose that it was due to a different FMC loading algorithm depending on whether the aircraft was still on the ground or airborne. So, unable to reinstall the correct departure, we began reverting to manual procedures. I told the Captain to load up the VOR and we would then fly off of that. Initially, he loaded up the wrong VOR frequency in the FMC, so the left hand turn it was commanding was clearly not correct. I am guessing that amidst all the confusion while hand flying, the aircraft began to slowly drift to the east of course. After about one minute after takeoff, ATC gave us a vector of 160 degrees and we complied. Meanwhile, the Captain continued to load up the necessary fixes and radials should we get vectored back to join up with the departure. ATC asked us if we had a problem, and we stated that we had lost our navigation system and that we were in the process of restoring it. I do not recall how far left of course we drifted. I seem to recall that the white dashed line of the extended runway centerline was still very close to our aircraft symbol on the FMC. Regardless, it is apparent that it was enough for the Controllers to intervene and query us if we had any issues. The lessons learned from this were: 1) FMC chimes and queries not critical to the phase of flight should be ignored until both crewmembers can assess the situation. 2) One pilot should not alter the FMC programming autonomously. Major FMC loads or changes should be discussed and agreed upon before irreversibly executing. 3) If there is an issue, turning on the autopilot will lessen the workload of both crewmembers allowing for more accurate and expeditious solutions. 4) Always have the backup navigation radios tuned for the departure. In the event of a navigational failure, they will be ready to be called up at a moments notice. 5) If you lose your programmed route, don't panic. First, establish raw data and ensure the aircraft is flying the proper ground track. Only then should you proceed with regaining the FMC programming. This is taught extensively in training, but the stress of the situation caused us to lose our focus. Also, don't feel ashamed to ask for vectors if the situation warrants. I appreciate the professionalism of the Controllers while handling and monitoring our aircraft.		A B777's FMC was slow uplinking during preflight and a requested update arrived after takeoff. The Captain mistakenly activated the new routing which deleted the existing information leaving the aircraft in a non LNAV capable condition. ATC graciously provided vectors.

Training kicked in and I stayed on the magenta line, turned early. ATC called me on it and stated there was 'no problem.'

Cleared the Mountain 6 vector departure which takes you out the 161 radial for 5 DME Intersection NICHY left turn then vectors.  We armed LNAV for takeoff and flew the NAV which led the turn at NICHY.  The NAV assumes NICHY is a fly-by waypoint, but on the chart its depicted as a fly-over.  I've flown into Seattle multiple times and used the LNAV and never had a Controller mention not flying over NICHY.  I'm not sure how to make NAV fly-over the point since it is a vector SID and not an RNAV?  I showed on my NAV display us very close to NICHY maybe within a half mile and relayed that to the Departure Controller.  Only way we could figure to comply is hand fly and over shoot the turn to fly-over NICHY.  Suggested resolution: clarify with ATC do they want NICHY to be flown over?  Convert it to an RNAV SID so automation will fly correctly.		A B737-800 flight crew reported that the SEA Mountain 6 SID NICHY waypoint in their aircraft's FMC database was incorrectly coded as a FLY-BY waypoint when it is a mandatory FLY-OVER waypoint. The corresponding NACO chart depicts NICHY as a FLY-BY waypoint.

We made that restriction (FL250) and, as soon as we did, ATC gave us another, 'Cross fifteen miles south of JAYJA at or below FL210, descend, and maintain FL200.'  The Captain was trying to program the FMC (we were in VNAV), but was having problems because EDISN is eleven miles south of JAYJA.  I went ahead and put 200 in the MCP window as I needed to verify that before I got back to my performance computer and I thought we needed to get started down.  The Captain realized the same thing and just selected Level Change at 280 KTS.  I don't remember how far we were from EDISN at that moment, but I thought it would take about twelve miles to get from FL250 to below 210 and I thought the 280 KT Level Change would do it.  I got back to my performance computer and didn't do anything to verify making the restriction.  A few minutes later, ZJX came on the radio and asked, 'You are fifteen miles south of JAYJA.  Are you below FL210?'  I looked up and we were descending through FL229.  I answered that we were passing that altitude.  ZJX told us to tell him when we were below FL210 and called out traffic fifteen miles south of us at FL220.  We cleared FL210 when we were about ten miles from that traffic based on TCAS.Going into a place like TPA with thunderstorms in the vicinity, I should have gotten my pilot not flying duties done earlier in anticipation of some deviations and non-standard descents.  We both need to set up some way to monitor the restriction after we get the descent started (in this case) based on our old-school math.  Afterwards we discussed putting JAYJA in the Fix page and putting a fifteen mile ring around it.  All that said, I think ZJX set us up for this.  He knew this was a tight descent, but gave us the instructions that alleviated him from having to monitor us and possibly do more work.  In my opinion, a good Controller would have said, 'Descend and maintain FL200.  Expedite through 210,' maybe even adding on the traffic call at that point.  This would have gotten us started down right away and if we were not going down fast enough, he would have given us a vector.  Obviously, there are times for these crossing restrictions, but I think this was an instance where some old-school controlling would have been safer for all involved.  We were given a restriction that we physically could have made and we did not.		We were flying the DADES 2 Arrival into TPA.  ATC assigned five miles north of JAYJA at FL260.  ATC then revised the clearance to cross JAYJA at or below FL260, cross fifteen miles south of JAYJA at FL210, and maintain FL200.  The flight had a tailwind and there was convective weather in the area.  The normal altitude at JAYJA is FL270.  We made the original restriction of five miles north of JAYJA at FL260, and crossed fifteen south of JAYJA at FL225.  It was a normal approach and landing.ATC needs to stop issuing these complicated clearances and expecting compliance with tight altitude restraints.  We were simply not able to comply.  By the time we realized it, we were approaching the restriction.  If a restriction is required, twenty miles from the point does not give us enough time to comply.  These clearances need to be given farther out.		B737 flight crew missed an assigned crossing restriction during descent into TPA.  A late clearance and the distractions of weather and approach preparation were cited as contributing factors.

Center advised to descend to FL180 and crew commenced descent after acknowledging to descend.  Shortly before reaching FL180, ATC issued a traffic advisory of a Beechcraft King Air at 17,500 FT.  We leveled at FL180.  [We] reported to ATC that traffic was not in sight looking for traffic.  Shortly thereafter, ATC issued another traffic advisory and the TCAS also began reporting 'Traffic.'  King Air traffic was observed on TCAS approximately 10 miles ahead and altitude on TCAS indicated 300 FT below on a direct course.  Immediately after the 'Traffic' advisory, the TCAS began issuing a resolution advisory to climb.  We immediately began a climb in accordance with RA procedures listed in the (airline and fleet) QRH.  [I] notified ATC that we would be vacating FL180 due to a TCAS resolution advisory.  At the conclusion of the resolution advisory, the intruder aircraft was reported by TCAS to be 300 FT below, at FL181 based upon the flight's altitude of 18,400 FT.  The intruder aircraft passed to the right side of the aircraft and was visually observed to be approximately 300 FT below and offset by approximately 500 FT.  The aircraft looked like a King Air 90 and ATC addressed the aircraft as so.  Both Captain and First Officer altimeters on flight indicated 18,000 FT with no error or deviation and the ISFD (Integrated Standby Flight Display) indicated same before the event.  At the conclusion of the event both altimeters indicated 18,400 FT and the ISFD indicated no difference.  After landing, the altimeters were checked against the field elevation with the altimeter setting of 29.92 applied.  No deviation from tolerances was noted.  [We] requested the full call sign of the aircraft to include in this report, ATC declined to provide the information.  Flight continued and landed without incident.  VMC conditions prevailed and we were vigilant for other traffic.  ATC should have applied better traffic separation between the King Air, which was operating in Class E Airspace, and we were operating in Class A Airspace.				B737 flight crew at FL180 reports TCAS RA with opposite direction King Air at 17500 FT. Evasive action was taken by climbing.

We elected to continue inbound and see if power would be restored during that time. We continued down to approximately 700 FT AGL, noticed the aircraft on the runway and no lighting. We flew the missed approach and entered holding. I switched back to Approach and tried to establish radio contact. Nothing. In fact we could not raise Medellin Approach or Tower. We continued in holding trying other available frequencies, to no avail. We finally tried Bogota Approach Control. After 3 attempts, while the Controller talked continuously in Spanish to other aircraft, she responded to us and told us to standby. Our original alternate was MPTO, however, the reserve fuel for this destination was overly optimistic considering the time of year and the operational way things are run in Central and South America. From the inbound deviations and holding at lower altitude, knowing we would be deviating around other thunderstorms en-route to MPTO, it was no longer an option. We looked at the FMC nearest airports and agreed SKBO was the best option. Both of us were familiar with the airport. We made our way over to SKBO at 16,000 FT, it was impossible to get a higher (more optimum altitude), as SKBO Control wanted us at 16,000 FT. In the process of coordinating with Dispatch, I checked the landing data for SKBO. With cool evening temperatures we were legal to fly in. Dispatch was sending repeated messages of 'Are you going to MPTO?' We responded, 'No, SKBO.' On the third transmission and roughly 60 miles from SKBO we received the ACARS message, 'You are not authorized to land at SKBO.' As fuel was becoming more of a concern for us, we decided to divert and fly directly to SKCL, both being left confused as to why SKBO was not authorized, however focused on getting to SKCL expeditiously. Inbound to SKCL we were given instructions to fly the MANGA 5 Arrival. We mentioned due to our fuel situation we wanted to go direct to the VOR; were told again to fly the MAGNA 5. Upon entering the arrival into the CDU and pushing enter, both CDU's failed for more than a couple of minutes. We had entered a portion of the arrival on the fix page and had raw data to continue flying the approach. We were also in VMC conditions at the time. We were cleared to 12,000 FT and then requested a lower altitude and were told to maintain 12,000 FT. After further requests for lower we were given 10,000 FT. We were continuously being left high on the arrival. While not at a point to declare a full emergency, there was no room to be flying around or eventually performing a missed approach. We were cleared for the arrival and the ILS 01. Being high we requested a deviation to the left and were then instructed to cross the CLO VOR at 9000 FT. The approach plate has a crossing at 5600 FT. I verified the altitude. There is no physical way to land an aircraft from 9000 FT over the VOR. I requested lower and was told 9000 FT again. We were at 9000 FT, with the runway in sight. Finally after 2 requests having a visual on the runway we were handed over to SKCL Tower, we requested a left 360 and descended to the appropriate altitude, and then given clearance to land. Upon landing we were asked why we did not comply with the previous instructions for the MANGA 5 arrival. We stated we had lost both flight computers and flew the arrival with raw data, and we were left high on the arrival, and then given clearance for the approach. Upon reaching the gate inSKCL, we requested engine oil and fuel. Spoke with Dispatch who seemed annoyed we had not gone to MPTO. Upon explaining the fuel was insufficient for MPTO we had decided to divert to SKBO, and had verified the landing data. Upon receiving the alarming ACARS of not authorized to land at SKBO we went to SKCL. We were given ample fuel this time for a quick flight back to SKRG where power had been restored to the airport. 1) I appreciate the company's desire to save money on fuel; however, operating realistically in Central and South America is nothing like flying in the US. First the divert fuel does not include enough fuel to deal with weather deviations that are STANDARD this time of year, secondly coordination for diverting and getting to an optimum altitude takes more time then we are accustomed to in the US. 2) I would like it shown to me where it is printed that we are not authorized to land in SKBO. We checked the Diversion Guide. Landing page states nothing. The Cali page shows SKBO as near by airfield. The FMC shows SKBO as nearby airport. I looked through the performance section and found no notes on not using SKBO. In fact I never remember being instructed in training to not use SKBO. Due to the weather and our fuel situation SKBO made far more sense to land then SKCL. Additionally upon looking more closely at SKBO pages, there are obvious notes that B737's operate into this airfield.				During arrival to SKRG a B737 crew discovered that the airport had experienced a complete power failure. After a missed approach the crew elected to divert to SKBO which the Dispatcher objects to. They then divert and fuel at SKCL then uneventfully return to SKRG where the power had been restored.

We were doing the POAS 3 Departure procedure from MROC on Runway 07. We performed a maximum energy takeoff 26K power with a run up of the engines before brake release and still were unable to meet the requirement of 5500 FT MSL by the 04 DME turn point. We had reached only 4500 FT MSL at the 4 DME point and I decided to press toward the terrain for another half mile before turning. At that time the aircraft altitude still was only 5000 FT when the procedure calls for 5500 FT. The weather was VFR and we had no conflicts otherwise but we concluded that one of two things is wrong. Either the turn restriction is supposed to be an either-or, as in start the turn at 4 DME or 5500 FT MSL, or the required climb gradient required out of SJO has been wrongly computed. We calculate the climb gradient required to be 1190 FT per NM. As it is published, this turn requirement seems to be impossible to comply with.	The crew reviewed the departure procedure in depth prior to departure and considered the 4 DME altitude constraint doable at 84 degrees ambient with a 26,000 pound thrust takeoff. The VOR is 1 NM Southwest of the Runway's approach end. The Runway is 1.8 NM long so the aircraft has 1.2 DME to climb 1,479' from the Runway's departure end to 4 DME. Given the second segment climb requirements the crew determined in retrospect that this departure should be refused because the climb requirements exceed the B737-800 capabilities.			A B737-800 Crew reported that their aircraft was unable to comply with the MROC Runway 07 POAS 3 Departure requirement to be at 5500' by 4 DME before starting the right turn.

The takeoff weight was 130.7. During the takeoff roll, the Captain's number two window slid open at 90 KTS.  I attempted to stow the window.  I was unsuccessful.  An abort was initiated at 120 KIAS.  The plane slowed to less than 60 KTS very rapidly.  We cleared the runway, informed the Tower of the abort, and told them we needed no assistance.  We informed the cabin of the abort.  We ran the checklist.  We determined that 58 minutes of cooling was required.  We returned to the gate.  Once at the gate, I went down to visually look at the landing gear.  I did not notice anything unusual other than a little additional heat.  I called Dispatch and Maintenance.  We concurred that no logbook entry was required.  I ordered additional fuel to bring us back to the Dispatch fuel requirement.  About twenty-five minutes into the cooling period, the Fueler informed me that the number two, right, main tire had deflated.  I went down and confirmed this.  I called Maintenance and they called Contract Maintenance.  I made a detailed logbook entry.  The tire was replaced. Once the number two Captain's window opened, I should not have attempted to close it.  An abort at first recognition would have allowed a lower speed stop.  This would have allowed the brakes to work with less effort and less heat build-up.		The Captain went outside and one of the tires (not exactly sure which one) had a melted fuse plug. Maintenance Control was advised and a writeup was made in the logbook. We were then swapped to another aircraft and eventually departed.The importance of checking the slide window and making sure it is closed is vital. I remember the Captain having the window open at the gate, but never thought about it after that. Once we got going, we were busy since we were already one hour late and I never thought about that window again. Things happen when least expected. Always be ready for the unexpected like a window opening on takeoff roll. Also, rejected takeoffs are very real and dynamic in nature. The conditions on this day also made the rejected takeoff more dangerous. So much so that had this happened on a shorter runway, I would probably consider taking it airborne, going around the pattern, and landing with the window open instead of rejecting a takeoff and creating other possible problems with the tires and brakes.		B737-700 flight crew reports Captain's window sliding open during takeoff at 90 KTS. The takeoff was rejected at 120 KTS and flight returned to the gate for brake cooling.

I had built an offset track waypoint of N61 degrees to identify crossing from Shanwick OCA into Reykjavik OCA. Our active waypoint was N62W20 then N63W30 next. Around the point of N61, I was identifying some alternate airports ICAO identifiers from the Flight Manual, the First Officer was reading something from the Flight Manual, we both felt the aircraft in an uncommanded bank, and looked up and saw the aircraft turning right on its own on. I selected heading select and brought it back to the magenta line, and pulled up Progress page 2 on the FMC CDU to note the cross track error distance. We were showing about 2.5 to 3 miles from the magenta line, and although we had an intercept angle, the distance was not decreasing. I looked at the legs page and nav display, the active waypoint was now N63W30, not the previous active waypoint of N62W20. Somehow the active waypoint, N62W20 dropped out on its own, and the aircraft began the uncommanded turn to intercept the course to the next waypoint N63W30. There was no activity on the CDU keys at the time of the event, it was all uncommanded.  I reloaded the correct and cleared waypoint N62W20 back into the FMS, it was in small white font on the ND, not magenta, and not on the legs page of the CDU, and re-established the course. No navigation deviation occurred, we were performing offset procedures at the time of 1 NM right, and through the event was never more than 2-3 NM right of course until the correction made and re-activation of the correct active waypoint. I am aware of the anomaly of FMC blanking, page 1 of AMSDIS, and of previous reports related similar to this issue. In this case however, unlike the published anomaly, we never have a standby message or blank PFD or ND. The ND remained through the event, however, only the active waypoint dropped on its own, and the FMC cycled to the next waypoint on the legs page. The aircraft was ADS B equipped, and within a minute or so, received a SELCAL from Reykjavik, and they asked for a position report, as I would assume they noticed the active waypoint was no longer the same as the cleared route when N62W20 dropped out. Again there was no CDU activity at the time of the event. The event occurred near the previously built along track waypoint, but not specifically at the N61 position, and was recognized quickly and corrected quickly.				A B777-200 crew reported that the active oceanic random track waypoint dropped out of the FMC and the aircraft transitioned to the next waypoint. A slight track deviation occurred before the crew reprogrammed the FMC back to the correct active waypoint.

Previous gripe, engine 1 high pressure (HP) bleed valve fault was fixed overnight so no MEL items on release. On taxi out we got an ECAM for the engine 1 HP bleed valve fault. Stayed on ramp, contacted Maintenance but could not clear it. As I had added fuel and the weather was VFR, we agreed to a deferral and did not have to return to the gate. Upon receiving the new release and complying with its restrictions we got a new flight plan for FL300 with the MEL applied. Climbing through 14,000 FT we got engine 2 bleed fault ECAM. Two resets were unsuccessful and as engine 1 bleed was closed per the deferral, I declared an emergency to return to departure airport. Using emergency authority I opened engine 1 bleed as the low pressure valve was working fine, this controlled the cabin pressure. My First Officer was the pilot flying and he handled ATC and flew the aircraft while I told the flight attendants we would be back on the ground in 7 minutes. Message was sent to Dispatch via ACARS followed by a PA to the passengers. All ECAMS were done and no overweight checklist to contend with. Started the APU and resumed ATC communications. Oddly enough, ATC was vectoring us for sequence. Confirmed we were an emergency aircraft and requested vectors for landing airport in sight. They seemed perturbed by this, not sure why, but oh well. On clearing the runway I advised Tower that we would taxi to the gate and no further assistance was needed from the emergency vehicles. Taxi to the gate and parking was uneventful. Upon shutdown and checklists complete, made a PA to passengers with more info as to why the return.				An A320 Captain reported losing #2 engine bleed after departing with #1 engine bleed deferred.  They declared an emergency and returned to departure airport.  Captain reported that for some reason ATC was vectoring them for sequence even though they were an emergency aircraft.

I was the pilot not flying, so I complied with the ECAM and followed up with the book.  The system cooled and I turned the blue pump back on as per the ECAM and Flight Manual.  After that was complete, I called Dispatch and got a patch with Maintenance.  The reception was bad, but I was able to convey the issue.  Maintenance told me if the ECAM returned I could reset the pump again if it cooled. On descent, the ECAM returned.  Again I complied with the ECAM, but this time the First Officer and I felt it would be better to not turn the blue pump back on.  We calculated the landing distance as per the manual and landed without incident.				An A320 Captain reported the blue hydraulic system overheated in climb.  Book procedure was followed, pump turned back on when system cooled, but overheat later returned on descent.

During the call with ATC the Flight Attendant's called with a maintenance writeup that was distracting, especially the overly loud chime that the Airbus has.  We were told to overfly DOBNE and given a new arrival into SFO.  While I was inputting new route the First Officer noticed the aircraft had started an early turn and we were not overflying DOBNE.  The First Officer used heading mode to turn towards the waypoint so that we would overfly it.  ATC then called and gave us a heading to overfly the waypoint which we did.  A few minutes later ATC said we were now clear of Joshua Airspace and we were cleared direct.  I believe we did fly over the waypoint with the First Officers intervention.  The Airbus does have a tendency to cut corners over waypoints.  In retrospect, I should have just used the overfly button at DOBNE to avoid any confusion.  It would have been helpful if ATC would have told us of Joshua's Airspace and the need for an overfly rather than the usual route the FMGC would follow.				A320 Captain reports being chimed by the Flight Attendant's at the same time a routing change was being issued by ATC.

Flight plan had initial altitude of FL280, but Center cleared us directly to FL360. I thought the altitude was unusually high for our high gross weight, but the (new) FMS display a REC MAX of FL363, so we accepted the clearance and maintained OPEN CLIMB to FL360.  The instant we entered 'ALT CAP' at FL360, the managed speed index moved from approx .78M to approx .72M (Green Dot/VLS).  When I saw this, I selected the PROG PAGE and noticed that the REC MAX altitude changed from FL363 to 334. Since the Captain was new on the airplane and was unfamiliar with the idiosyncrasies and consequences of low mach at the upper limit of altitude capability, I manually selected a speed of .77M and suggested we request a lower altitude.  We requested a lower altitude from Center and received a clearance down to FL340, at which time the REC MAX display changed from FL334 to FL343.  We captured FL340 and the PERF page at that new altitude showed a new optimum speed of .77M, whereupon we re-selected managed speed.  It appears that, in the new FMS, the performance algorithm for calculating REC MAX altitude in the climb is different than that used for cruise. Thus, the displayed REC MAX altitude changed from FL363 to FL334 the instant we changed from OPEN CLIMB to ALT CAP. This may be an item for the fleet technical group to look at.  On our flight, the displayed REC MAX altitude was unrealistically high during the climb and could have resulted in a high-altitude unacceptably low-speed condition had we not intervened in overriding the automatic features of the FMS/AutoPilot.				An A320 FMS computed a higher recommended maximum cruise altitude during OPEN CLIMB than was computed when the FMS transitioned to ALTITUDE CAPTURE at cruise. The crew descended down to the REC MAX computed for cruise.

We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The decision was made to divert to ZZZ due to the lack of fire detection in the aft cargo area. We then dumped over 44,000 pounds of fuel coordinated with ATC. We landed uneventfully.  Maintenance ran some tests and reset the system. The aircraft had a history of this issue. No parts were available in ZZZ. The cargo was removed and the detectors deferred. We then continued on to our destination. The 3 DET messages came back on an hour past our coast out point.

While this clearance in and of itself is fine, at no time did Approach Control ever give us instruction or clearance on how to transition from the arrival to approach phase.  This led to some confusion and I then asked if we should maintain our present heading to join the localizer 22R. The Controller agreed and recleared us for the approach.  I am beginning to see a trend in this type of clearance which lacks some crucial part. Chicago is a very complex environment in which mistakes can be made. The controllers need to be clear and concise and not give 3-4 clearances in one transmission that can lead to confusion or omission on the part of the flight crew.				An A320 flight crew received an approach clearance to ORD while still on the WYNDE 2 RNAV STAR.  The clearance provided no method of 'transition' from the arrival to the IAP.

Captain and First Officer were working a problem with the pressurization system. Aircraft was dispatched with a couple of problems with the left Air Conditioning/Pressurization System (HPSOV MEL and Trim Air MEL). Captain and First Officer were working a new problem: Right Body Bleed Loss. When I got to the cockpit the Captain had already initiated a conversation with Maintenance and Dispatch. The synoptic did not indicate whether or not the left isolation valve had closed, and this was causing the Captain some consternation as he was concerned as to exactly where that bleed air was leaking. Maintenance was not able to provide a satisfactory answer, so the Captain decided upon the most conservative course of action and turned off the Right Bleed and descended to FL250. We were in radar and radio contact so this was quickly approved. We were discussing the situation and I offered the opinion that we should not be using the synoptic presentation to diagnose problems with the air conditioning. The suggestion was also preferred that there is no altitude restriction for single pack operation with this aircraft. The Captain considered both points and decided that FL250 was the most prudent course of action. We crossed at 250, received revised clearance to an en route airport and proceeded uneventfully. It should be noted that while we were on approach, we received several EICAS and STATUS messages all relating to both Air Conditioning/Pressure System (i.e. Outflow Valve Left, Outflow Valve Right, etc.)				A B777 EICAS alerted R BODY BLEED LOSS. The crew was unable to determine the exact nature of the loss and so diverted to an enroute airport as a precaution.

A little while later she said the oven was still getting hot so I turned off the cab/utility switch momentarily. Maintenance was contacted. They advised for to pull both circuit breakers just in case and that I should not have to turn off the cabin/utility switch. The Flight Attendant pulled both breakers and I turned the cab/utility switch back on. A little while later the Flight Attendant called back up and said it was still getting hot so at that point I went back to check. I found the oven warm but not powered up. It continued to cool and all involved (Maintenance, all four Flight Attendant's, and the First Officer and I) were in agreement that it was safe to continue. About the last forty five minutes of the flight, the other Flight Attendant said that her throat was getting a little scratchy. She also stated that they both had a slight headache. I asked if they were dizzy, sick to their stomach, etc. and they said no. I asked if they wanted to contact med-link or have the paramedics meet the plane and they initially declined. Later though they agreed to have the paramedics meet the plane. Dispatch was contacted and med-link was notified. The paramedics met the airplane and they were examined and advised them to go to the hospital.				B737 Captain was informed during climb that an oven came on uncommanded.

Later, on 15 mile final, an ECAM for F/O AOA vane was received.  On taxi in an ECAM for AIR PACK Regulator was received and, while waiting for a gate, an ECAM for FAC1 appeared.  These ECAMs cleared, but eventually came back to some degree during the next 10 minutes.  Several more (I forget which ones) ECAMs were received while we were briefing maintenance at the gate.  I think the lavatory overflow may have leaked into the E & E bay during descent and taxi, causing multiple, unrelated ECAMs to be displayed.  I feel very fortunate to have been on the ground, and not had to deal with the majority of these events while airborne.  After thinking the situation through, this seems to be an anomaly that may require landing ASAP if a forward lavatory overflows.				An A320 Captain reported multiple seemingly unrelated ECAM messages were displayed on approach and after landing following a report of an overflowing forward lavatory shortly before beginning the descent.

About one hour and fifteen minutes into the flight, Flight Attendants reported strong and unusual fumes/odor emanating from gasper and air vents above R2 door in aft galley. Fumes described as 'electrical'. Captain performed the Smoke/Fumes Checklist in its entirety. After further discussion with Flight Attendants about possible origination and severity, they strongly requested a pilot come back to evaluate. First Officer (myself) went to aft location to investigate, while Captain assumed pilot flying duties. After returning to flight deck and conversing with Captain, we determined it would be prudent to divert to the nearest suitable airport. We declared an emergency and landed uneventfully. We were met by CFR personnel, Flight Attendants were checked by EMT's and given oxygen, and aircraft was deplaned into terminal via air stairs. There was no visible fire, but the fumes continued to be present even after shutdown on the ground and deplaning. Some CFR personnel reported headaches and feeling dizzy after being in the aircraft and being exposed to the fumes. I am not aware of any passenger-reported illness.I feel that the incident was handled very well in the air. Ground support was awesome. I have been involved in a few emergency/incident situations at this airline. In my observations, it is disturbing that the Flight Attendants are pressured to fly by their direct Supervisors and Scheduling after an event - even when it creates great emotional distress for some of them - and in this case inhalation of an unknown toxic fumes. Flight Attendants are threatened with 'demerits' if they state they are unable to fly after this sort of event. If enough of these 'demerits' are accumulated - they can be terminated by Management. It is because of this policy that our Flight Attendants submitted to continuing the flight. Even though there was a fresh Flight Attendant crew that came down on our rescue airplane, ours were scheduled to work. Not one of them got a phone call to ask how they were doing immediately after the flight. I wish I'd have taken photos of the poor Flight Attendants in the ambulance, while sucking on oxygen and looking a shade of green. Common sense after an incident for crew human factors and continued safety and concern toward their ability to perform is non-existent with regard to Flight Attendants. The Flight Attendants relayed to me that their stress was greater dealing with their Supervisor, than it was during the actual incident and that they felt coerced and threatened into working for fear of getting demerits - despite their physical and mental impairments. Who is going to take responsibility to change this? How can I be sure that if they continue on that they will be able to successfully perform in another emergency if called upon after the first event? When will this change? What will it take? Is anyone listening - or seeing this?				B737 First Officer describes the events surrounding a report of electrical fumes in the cabin by Flight Attendants and the resultant diversion.

We were very close-in using speed brake on descent, set up for 17L. ATC gave us a heading and advised we would get 18R. We re-set up everything for 18R (we had briefed this, but did not expect it this close in) cleared direct to ORL VOR at 3,000 FT. We called the airport in sight to slow and go to 2,500 FT (our last assigned speed was 210). ATC said he would clear us for a visual in a bit. I slowed to 190 anticipating the clearance soon. We were just north of ORL VOR when he cleared us for the visual to 18R, maintain 2,500 until south of the VOR. I set 2,500 in and started slowing, gear down, slow down, flaps 3 landing check. At this point we were about 400 FT high, so auto pilot off, flight directors off, flaps full. We were stable at 500 FT and landed.ATC late runway change, we just did the same approach two days earlier and requested the right side but did not get it (our book says don't request it, they know) so my mind set was we would get 17L. I should have slowed down and told ATC I was slowing instead of holding the assigned speed of 210 KTS. I should have not accepted the runway change. Accepting the late change would have worked out had ATC cleared me for the visual early as I could have slowed and descended to 2,500 and got the gear down early. It worked out, however induced a very high work load and stress, and a lot of heads down to reprogram the new runway/approach.ATC should make up their minds which runway they are going to use at least 30 miles out, and if the other comes up at least ask if you want it not [just] assign it to you. Clear you for the visual or at least give you a normal speed not assign 210 and forget they did. I should have told them I was slowing and just slowed. It seems to me they keep you at 12,000 FT too long when landing to the south.				A320 Captain experiences a late runway change and a late clearance for a visual after previously being assigned 210 knots. An unstabilized approach fortunately results in a normal landing.

The light appeared on for a few seconds, then extinguished, and once again reappeared.  I was not sure what I was visualizing until the second laser attack.  I promptly lowered my head so as to avoid any further eye contact with the laser.  I promptly notified ATC about the laser event.  The Captain who was the pilot flying continued the approach and stated that he saw another green flashing light in the cockpit when we were approximately over the site where I first observed the laser.

The crossfeed valve position indicator light failed to illuminate when I opened the crossfeed valve.  I checked the valve position light bulbs by pushing on the light and by using the light test switch.  The light failed to illuminate during both tests so I assumed the bulbs were out.  I was surprised that both bulbs in the light would have burned out in the short period since successful preflight checks.  I changed both bulbs and checked the light by pressing to test and by using the light test switch.  The valve position light was still inoperable.  I scanned the circuit breaker panel and found the crossfeed valve circuit breaker open.  After discussing the situation with the First Officer, I reset the circuit breaker; the valve position light properly illuminated during the press to test and when using the light test switch.  I again attempted to open the crossfeed valve.  The position indicator light briefly illuminated and then went out.  We found the crossfeed valve circuit breaker was open again.  It appeared that the crossfeed valve position light would not test or operate with the crossfeed valve circuit breaker open.  We did not reset the circuit breaker a second time.  The First Officer referenced the QRH and turned to the Crossfeed Valve Inoperable procedure.  We discussed the procedure noting that it did not match our situation exactly, because we could not use the valve position light to determine the position of the crossfeed valve.  I began a fuel burn log to see if we could determine what was being burned where and possibly determine the position of the crossfeed valve.  Both center tank fuel pumps were on while we were evaluating our situation so I decided to continue using both center tank pumps for a few more minutes until the center fuel tank quantity was just below one thousand pounds.  The First Officer and I reviewed QRH fuel balancing methods and discussed diverting if we could not maintain the fuel balance.  I secured the center tank pumps with 850 pounds remaining in the center tank.  We initially had a fuel imbalance of about 200 pounds greater in the right wing.  In the span of about twenty minutes, the right quantity decreased by about 1,300 pounds and the left decreased by about 400 pounds.  The fuel flow on the engines was almost identical.  With fuel being consumed unequally from both tanks and no crossfeed valve position light, I could not confidently determine the position of the crossfeed valve.  I felt uncomfortable securing the left fuel pumps to maintain the fuel balance, because of the possibility of the loss of adequate fuel pressure to the left engine.  We decided to divert.  We were about 160 miles southeast of a major hub and about 80 miles from an out station.  I chose hub because of Maintenance and Passenger accommodation capabilities.  I coordinated with Dispatch and the First Officer coordinated with ATC.  I informed the Flight Attendants of our decision to divert and then made a PA to let the Passengers know we'd be diverting.  I used the right center tank pump to fuel depletion to minimize the fuel imbalance.  The approach and landing were uneventful.  We landed under max landing weight and the fuel imbalance was 900 pounds.  Operations had a gate ready for us and Maintenance was at the aircraft just a few minutes after we arrived.  The aircraft was taken out of service and the Passengers and Crew continued to the scheduled destination on another aircraft that arrived shortly after we deplaned.  I should have scanned for popped circuit breakers and referenced the QRH more quickly.  If both bulbs in a light are burned out in less than an hour after preflight checks then it's probably not the bulbs.  Also, the QRH doesn't mention a popped circuit breaker in the CrossfeedValve Inoperable procedure.  I feel like attempting to balance the fuel without a positive indication of crossfeed valve position could lead to loss of fuel pressure to the engine and subsequent flameout.				A B737 NG fuel crossfeed circuit breaker popped rendering the crossfeed indicating lights and valves inoperable. The crew diverted to an enroute station in order maintain fuel balance within limits.

The takeoff roll was normal until 100 KTS. The takeoff warning horn sounded. We were unsure if the aircraft was safe to fly. The decision had to be made immediately, and we chose to abort, as again, we unsure if the aircraft was safe to fly. The abort was normal. We exited at the end, ran the checklist and QRH, which indicated a twenty-five minute cooling off period. We taxied to the gate, called Maintenance, and replaced the FSEU (Flaps/Slat Electronic Unit) box. The next takeoff was uneventful. Evidently, this malfunction has occurred numerous times previously, although I had not heard of it before this incident. This FSEU problem information needs to be incorporated into the FOM, or this information needs to be disseminated to the pilots via a bulletin. But, when you get a takeoff warning above 80 KTS and before V1, are we to assume it is just a harmless malfunction, or the flaps or slats have actually split, or blown up, or what? A takeoff warning could mean the aircraft is unsafe to fly. In the alternative, I would suggest adjusting the parameters of the FSEU to a level, which would not create these warnings unless there is a significant problem.		Has something happened to somehow change the configuration of the flaps or leading edge devices? By the warning horn not sounding during the throttle burst prior to takeoff, was the system working properly at that point? I think it is a reasonable reaction to believe that the aircraft was not safe to fly. With only seconds to decide what is actually happening when a takeoff warning horn is sounding (erroneously) at high speed, perhaps some consideration should be taken to change the warning parameters of the Flaps/Slat Electronic Unit.		A B737's takeoff was rejected when the takeoff warning horn sounded at 100 KTS. Maintenance determined that Flap/Slat Electronic Unit issued a false warning.

'V' speed callouts were made by the non-flying pilot with reference to the weight/balance printout. Following lift-off and normal autopilot engagement recognized that commanded pitch and thrust indications were not normal. Autopilot caused aircraft to pitch up to a point that I believe would have maintained Vls speed, thrust lever movement to climb appeared to have to no corresponding immediate thrust reduction. [We] disengaged autopilot to hand fly proper pitch [and] disconnected autothrust to regain proper thrust for continued climb to initial level-off altitude, 8,000'. At initial level-off, prior to achieving proper reduced thrust value, experienced momentary 'clean' airspeed overspeed (250 KTS below 10,000'). ATC asked us to confirm our airspeed; First Officer responded that it was '250 KTS'. After new cruise altitude was selected, reengaged autopilot and autothrust; all remaining operations completely normal using fully 'managed' and automated configuration. Please note that this situation occurred following a change of runway assignment.  In re-reading A-330 Handbook bulletin it would appear that this situation should be expected following every runway change which occurs after original 'PERF Takeoff' entries have been made. In this situation, the 'Confirm TO DATA' entry action was not done. Rather, the First Officer manually entered 'V' speeds as if this was an entirely new take-off iteration. Those re-entered 'V' speeds and FLEX thrust values were properly displayed and confirmed during the subsequent 'TAXI' checklist. The First Officer confirmed that no further entries or changes to the FMC were made after the 'TAXI' checklist was completed. In reading the aforementioned handbook bulletin in the most verbatim fashion, it would appear that 'V' speed information may continue to be displayed on both PFD's following a runway change but will disappear 'after FLEX or TOGA is selected'...in fact, further guidance on how to continue the takeoff without the expected 'SRS' display is contained in the same bulletin. I would suggest that trying to remember the contents and corrective actions contained in a two-year old bulletin while trying to wrestle with a near gross takeoff weight A-330 at 500' AGL would tend to be nearing the 'red' side of most pilot's comfort and safety levels. Perhaps we should consider demonstrating this degradation anomaly during future simulator sessions.				An A330 Captain reported that after a runway change prior to departure, the FMS was not updated although the V Speeds were changed. During takeoff the SRS did not engage and after liftoff autothrottle and autopilot pitch commands were erroneous.

Approximately 3 hours into flight, I was on rest break in the cabin and I was awakened by the Flight Attendant and informed that we had shut down an engine and were diverting. Upon arriving in the cockpit a few minutes later, we were FL200, left engine shut down for loss of oil and loss of oil pressure. We were dumping fuel en route to alternate which was approximately 60 miles away at that time. Approach, landing and taxi to gate were uneventful. Aircraft was inspected by ground rescue personnel on runway prior to taxi to gate with no damage or visible leaks detected.

I was second in command on a two Captain crew of 4. We were very heavy weight and the temperature was hot. No assumed temperature thrust reduction was used and we requested the longer runway for departure to avail ourselves of the extra ground run available. Takeoff was normal except for the fact that our lift off speed was well above V2 and we had a low altitude 'hold down' of 1,700 FT (not even 1,000 FT above the airport elevation). The aircraft climbed rapidly as the nose was pulled to a higher than normal attitude to bleed off the extra airspeed and then the autopilot was engaged rapidly after takeoff at approximately 200 FT AGL. The aircraft automation captured the altitude set in the altitude window immediately and started the automatic level off maneuver. Since the throttles were at a high power setting (no assumed temperature setting) and since the flaps were still set at 15 from takeoff, the aircraft auto throttles retarded the engine power to idle to either attain V2 + 15 or to protect against flap over speed. At the same time that the throttles were retarding to idle, Air Traffic Control (ATC) directed a large left hand turn followed shortly thereafter with a separate radio call directing us to climb to 2,800 FT (only a 1,100 FT change in altitude). The First Officer was preoccupied with the radio calls and missed the next crucial event. Just prior to beginning the turn the Captain disconnected the auto throttles because he didn't know why they had reduced the thrust levers to idle. He thought they were malfunctioning although they were operating normally. He then commenced the turn with the heading select knob as directed by ATC and forgot about the throttles being at idle. The airspeed continued to bleed off. When the next altitude change was given, and while the aircraft was in a turn the altitude was dialed in by the First Officer and executed even though the autopilot was engaged and this 'Mode Control Panel' change should have been executed by the Captain (the pilot flying). At this point I am not sure if 'Flight Level Change' was selected or if it was still in VNAV, but the aircraft began a climb while still in the turn. I was preoccupied with watching the airspeed which was rapidly decreasing. I was sitting in the left jump seat (located just behind and between the Captain and First Officer) and started announcing loudly 'Airspeed!', 'Airspeed!' as the speed decreased below 200 KTS. When there was no appropriate response and as the airspeed decreased below V2 I yelled as loud as I could 'Lower the Nose!' 'Maximum Power!', 'Maximum Power!' I undid my seat belt and was leaning forward to push the throttles to maximum thrust when the Commander beat me to it and pushed the throttles to maximum power as he disconnected the autopilot and lowered the nose of the aircraft. The First Officer had placed her hand behind the throttles as they were moved forward but did not touch them. TOGA was NOT pushed. We eventually reached V2 minus 15 KTS and the stick shaker had activated along with stall buffet onset by the time the engines had spooled. We were in an undeveloped, (but rapidly developing) heavyweight takeoff stall. Had it been one more nanosecond, we would have been way too far behind the power curve to recover. There was no altitude to exchange for airspeed. The aircrafts' 110,000 LB thrust engines spooled to full power and thankfully we accelerated (slowly at first) to a safe airspeed. I think the flaps were over sped during the recovery (since there was no auto throttle protection). The flaps were retracted by the Captain during the recovery (NOT by the First Officer). The First Officer called for 'auto throttles' and they were reengaged. The throttles went from maximum thrust to climb power as expected. Another altitude change was given and we continued the climb to altitude in VNAV with no further notable events.				A B777-200 relief pilot reported a low altitude heavy weight near stall shortly after takeoff when the Captain lost situational awareness.

Followed by a descend clearance to 4,000 feet and turn for a base leg just past abeam the marker. Our speed was 210K. ATC reported fairly calm winds on the ground but winds were quartering tail winds about 16 knots at the altitude. My First Officer tried to slow down and go down but the tailwinds made the situation worse. He configured the airplane and started doing S turns but approach was fast and high. We crossed the outer marker 1,300 feet high. Sink rate was more than 1,200 feet per minute. Weather at the time was VMC. I can tell the aircraft was approaching the correct flight path; however airspeed was excessive and more than Vref+15k. First Officer started reducing the airspeed after catching the glide slope. I came very close to calling the go around but I didn't since he got the situation under control and was correcting rapidly. The runway was fairly long. Landing was normal. Threshold height was okay. However airspeed was more than the target. I think we didn't meet the stabilized approach criteria. I failed to call go-around. My First Officer displayed very good flying skills and situational awareness on the previous flights. I think that made me complacent. This was also last day of 4 day trip. Every day was very early get ups with long duty days. I think sleep deprivation and fatigue were catching up. I debriefed the approach and the landing with my First Officer. We reviewed the stabilized approach criteria and we decided it is okay to go around.				An A320 Captain reported his First Officer flew a high, fast, unstabilized approach to a landing when they should have gone around. The reporter cited fatigue as a factor.

During the briefing he made a comment about the N1 setting being too low. After his briefing, I asked him to take out the paper work and verify all takeoff settings, which he did. My paper work showed a 26K max takeoff and the ACARS takeoff data showed 24K max. We were 2,000 LBS lighter and he stated that we can do a 24K max takeoff. The N1 in the FMC showed about 85% N1. He stated that everything was correct for that power setting. The Taxi checklist was completed. On takeoff roll the power came up to 84.7 and I noticed that the aircraft was slow to accelerate. I pushed the power levers up to about 93% with a slow rotation. On climb out I selected MCT (Maximum Continuous Thrust) and climbed out normally.We are not sure how this occurred. The Copilot told me that the aircraft was scheduled to go to the wrong destination and he had to reload the FMC with a lot of changes. Somehow, a lower outside temperature was put in the FMC. The copilot doesn't remember how or when the lower temperature was entered. We contacted Dispatch en route to let them know we had a problem with the FMC. We gave them as much detail as we could to see if they could figure out what mistake we made or if there was a problem with the computers performance. On landing, we called Operations and were told that we had placed the wrong temp in the FMC during preflight.During the flight we pulled out the performance book and started to figure out what would have caused the FMC to show a lower power setting then what the paperwork from the ACARS would show. We determined that a lower outside temperature would have reduced the setting by the N1 that we had. On the taxi out we verified the settings and when the Copilot looked at the N1 setting he said he saw 85% not 95%. When I asked the Copilot to verify the takeoff settings, I should have delayed the takeoff until I had a chance to verify the performance as well. I knew the N1 setting was low, but with the length of the runway I didn't consider this too low of a setting. I did tell the Copilot in the future, when you preflight the airplane and there is data in the FMC from another flight, to mention this to the Captain. By doing this, this might have caused me to take a better look at the N1 settings, knowing that a lot of changes were made to the FMC during the preflight.				B737 Captain reports taking off with a calculated power setting of 85% N1 when it should have been 95% N1. Power was added during the takeoff roll when below normal acceleration was recognized.

We were about number 10 in the holding pattern with other aircraft holding above us. Clear on inbound fix but when turning outbound you were close to cirrus precipitation blow off. Descending in the turn outbound about FL220 being banked we encountered a couple of jolts/turbulence lasting about 5 to 8 seconds. 5 coach Flight Attendants lost balance and were hurt. Seat belt sign was on. About 30 minutes from landing PA was made and then we were put in the hold. I was listening to all aircraft in the hold with us, both above and below for any complaints of turbulence as we as well as other aircraft asked for right turns instead of left but were told unable. There were no complaints from other aircraft in the hold and we were descended in 2,000 FT step-down increments. There were no thunderstorms or convective activity where we were holding. All weather was east south east of the airport, but this was probably remnants of what had past through earlier. There was nothing I could see that warranted having the Flight Attendants being seated. In hindsight I would probably err more on the better to be safe than sorry to have the Flight Attendants take their seats.		I was Flight Attendant #10 in the aft mid-class galley preparing for landing assisting #2 with liquor cart. Suddenly without any warning we were in severe turbulence. This lasted 7-10 seconds. Everything that was loose was headed to the ceiling. This includes galley items, carts, and Flight Attendants. There were 5 Flight Attendants injured because of severe turbulence, no passengers injured. Flight Attendants were transported to the [hospital] by ambulance. I submitted a more in depth report to Airline and Union Safety Department. It is my understanding that there were thunderstorms in the area and the aircraft had been circling the airport before landing and this was our third go around. I don't know this to be a fact, but the Captain should have advised the Flight Attendants of the conditions. I do hope that he included this in his report for severe turbulence. I never heard any communications from the cockpit after the incident or PA's to the passengers before landing. I also wonder[ing] if the aircraft was checked since it was involved in 5 people injured in turbulence or allowed to return without inspection. I really feel the Captain is responsible for the entire crew, passengers and the aircraft. We should have been advised of the weather in the area, maybe we would not have had the injuries that the flight attendants sustain. Also, the Flight Attendants did an excellent job making sure all passengers were seated with seatbelts fastened that is the only reason there were no passengers injured. I can not stress the fact that the Captain is accountable for the security and safety of the aircraft, passengers and crew.		A B777 encountered severe turbulence while descending in the clear near some thunderstorm blow off. Five flight attendants were injured and required medical attention.

On the initial clearance I read back descend to FL330 but we dialed FL320. ATC confirmed when I checked in after the frequency change I said we were descending to FL320. I know ATC does not have to confirm the altitudes but this may an example that they should. We were in error because we did not hear the instructions correctly and entered the wrong flight level. Better vigilance on our part to be sure we hear things correctly especially when numbers are close sounding in nature ex. 330 320. After our frequency change ATC should be aware of our required flight level and check against their paperwork in front of them.

We requested 24R and was told it didn't look good. The Captain started to set the FMC up for 25L and, approximately ninety seconds later, we were told to cross SEEVU at 250 knots and then cleared for the 25L approach. We were at 280 knots previously assigned. I then went heads-down to finish setting up for the 25L approach. A few seconds later, ATC asked us to start our descent to 13,000, which is when I saw we were high on the arrival. The Captain started the descent with the speed brakes. We would have met the crossing, but then we were asked if we were at 250 knots. I confirmed we were at 280 and told to slow to 250 at SEEVU. We were then told he wanted us at 230 knots immediately. We started to slow and I realized we would never meet the crossing. I informed ATC who then gave us a heading south of the arrival and we were told to descend to 11,000 and to expect a turn back on course in one minute. We were then turned back in and landed without incident. (Of note, the Captain later told me we were given relief for the crossing restriction to slow, but I never heard it.) We never missed a crossing because of the vector after informing ATC we would miss it, but it was enough of a cluster to file an ASAP Report.

We cleared the runway and discovered that the yellow hydraulic fluid was well below normal range. Taxied back to the gate, serviced yellow system, checked for leaks, and continued to our destination.The flight we had just flown in with the same aircraft was a start of day departure. Maintenance was rushing to complete the required scheduled maintenance [for that departure]. A Maintenance Supervisor showed up 10 minutes prior to departure and watched over the mechanics shoulder obviously concerned about the on-time departure. Maintenance had done some work with the yellow hydraulic system and needed to pressurize the system. A LOW AIR PRES ECAM was present. They increased the APU output and got the message to clear. The yellow system appeared to be over-serviced and some of the fluid was drained to get within limits. The blue and green systems were also topped off. We pushed back late and were going to taxi on one engine. The LOW AIR PRES ECAM came back on and we decided to start the right engine to see if we could get the ECAM to go away which it did.We then took off on our initial flight. I was flying and was a bit concerned with the brake temperature indicator being deferred going into a short runway with a quick turn. When we landed I checked the charts for the required cooling time; which was 30 minutes. I went out to do the walk-around to observe the brakes. They seemed warm but not hot and I was happy with the 30 minutes required to cool the brakes. We briefed the takeoff procedure and were cleared for takeoff and had just gotten takeoff power when we received the ECAM for the low air pres, and that's when I aborted the takeoff.

The Captain elected to abort the take off. While decelerating I notified Tower that we were aborting and then notified the Flight Attendants and passengers to remain seated over the PA. We cleared the runway and decided to return to the gate. While we were on taxi back to the gate, we coordinated with ramp control to have the wheels chocked due to the hot brakes. We returned to the gate and waited for ramp personnel to chock the wheels. A few minutes later the ramp personnel notified us that the fuse plugs had blown and the left main tires were flat. Shortly after that, maintenance personnel boarded the aircraft and notified the Purser that the left main gear was smoking, and that she should get the passengers off the aircraft as soon as possible. She initiated an expeditious deplaning of the passengers through the jetway. No further event occurred. After maintenance determined that there was no further fire hazard, passengers were allowed to return to retrieve their belongings.				An A320 flight crew reported the First Officer's airspeed indicator failed on the takeoff roll. The Captain rejected the takeoff, and after returning to the gate the left main gear tire fuse plugs melted and the passengers were evacuated through the jetway.

The flight crew experienced a green laser illumination sighted at the aircraft for approximately 3 to 4 seconds. The laser broadcast four or five sweeps with two direct sightings in the cockpit. The Captain received direct exposure to the left eye. The event was reported to NCT Approach as a PIREP. Also, the laser illumination was reported to the Company after landing. The source of the laser appeared to be ground based from the vicinity of the northern San Jose or Milpitas area at a distance of 5 SM due north of the San Jose International Airport. After noting the area and street locations, a local road map revealed the source area to be Berryessa Creek Park. The aircraft continued the approach and landing without further incident.

A TCAS TA annunciation occurred followed by an RA to descend. An eastbound target appeared to be above our altitude and in turn to the left. Autopilot was disconnected and the TCAS avoidance guidance command was followed. Vertical separation was roughly 600 FT and lateral separation was estimated to be less than 1/4 mile. After TCAS 'clear of conflict' was issued, returned to FL340. Remainder of flight was normal.		We were cruising in smooth air at FL340. We received a traffic alert from the TCAS without any traffic alert or warning from Center. We immediately began scanning the tube for guidance and I began to scan out the windshield. Within approximately 3 seconds of the traffic alert it became an RA with the instructions to descend. Center came on simultaneously commanding both flights to turn left 30 degrees immediately. I gained a visual contact on a two engine jet descending upon us on a collision course and emphatically advised the Captain to turn and comply with the RA. Captain smoothly complied with the RA and I readied myself to push hard on the controls if necessary to avoid collision. The other aircraft banked left and appeared to halt descend. We had descended to FL334. The other aircraft passed off to the right side of our aircraft at a high closure rate of which I would approximate 500 FT vertically and 1,800 FT horizontally. We climbed back to altitude and were handed off to another frequency. We immediately notified dispatch of the near miss collision.		A B737 crew reported taking evasive action following a TCAS RA at FL340. The traffic was seen passing within 600 FT vertically and a quarter mile horizontally in a turn.

As the gear was being retracted the left engine EGT gage displayed a full red indication. The EGT limits came back within the normal range when the throttles came to climb power after the flaps moved to position 1 climb power. The crew felt the overheat lasted approximately 5 seconds and reached approximately 680, 5 degrees above the limit of 675. The onboard maintenance computer registered 676, 1 degree above limit. Crew felt comfortable with the engine's performance during the rest of the climb. Captain asked for a conference call to be set up between Maintenance, Dispatch, the 777 Chief Pilot. I wanted an answer to the question 'Is it legal to go ETOPS with an engine that had exceeded a published limit.' Maintenance said that there was a 20 degree buffer built for exceedances, and that 685 was the real limit. The 777 GURU joined the conference call and said he thought it was legal to continue if the MEL did not prohibit it. Crew decided to continue.				A B777 EGT slightly overheated to 680 degrees on an ETOPS takeoff. The Captain was concerned that continuing ETOPS with that event was not possible but was told that because the MEL did not prohibit operation and the actual limit was 685 so the flight continued.

Gear did not initially indicate up and locked. Gear handle was left in the retract position and within 15 seconds indicated up and locked and the LGCIU failure ECAM went away. BSCU 1 fault remained until flight termination. Left the plane in the flaps 2 takeoff position and reported to Tower that we had a problem. We turned west per ATC and then turned north to a downwind for the runway. Contacted Dispatch and communicated our situation to Maintenance Control. We kept them on line and extended the gear which extended normally. We did not declare an emergency but the equipment was rolled for our landing. We requested Tower to observe our landing gear as well as possible with binoculars and they did not see anything unusual so we made a visual approach and uneventful landing. Am unaware at this time what the problem was but our decision to return appears to have been the correct choice.				An A320 returned to the departure airport after grinding noises were heard upon gear retraction, accompanied by ECAM LGCIU and BSCU failure warnings.

ATC requested that we come left to a heading of 060 degrees. The First Officer, who was flying, dialed 006 into MCP, and I (as pilot not flying) failed to notice the discrepancy. A short time later, ATC asked if we were still turning to the 060 heading and we informed him that we were heading 006. ATC then requested we turn to a 075 degree heading. We complied and nothing further was said by ATC about the error. The pilot flying needs to correctly put in the assigned heading and the pilot not flying has to back him up and make sure that it is the correct assigned heading.		I am confident that the Captain read it back correctly, but somehow I interpreted '006' degrees rather than the actual assigned heading of '060.'The Captain was absolutely correct when he told me, 'No one issues a 006 vector!' I realize I should have automatically questioned turning the heading bug to 006 rather than 060.		Hearback readback problems between both pilots of a B737-700 and ATC resulted in a short term heading deviation.

The right engine instruments showed the N2 at zero within approximately 3 to 5 seconds after the loud bang was heard. We declared an emergency with ATC, descended to 10,000 FT, asked ATC for a heading of 060 and went through the QRC, secured the engine, advised the cabin what was happening and gave a cabin advisory and dumped to 77,000 LBS of fuel remaining. We landed overweight at 472,000 LBS.  We followed all the FOM procedures and notified Dispatch. A normal, soft 20 flap landing was made following a visual ILS approach. Autobrakes level 3 used to stop. Emergency equipment inspected the plane for fire after turning off the runway. All was normal, so we taxied to the gate using our left engine. ATC did a great job. One thing ATC did that was very nice was give us our own discreet radio frequency. ATC also was great about not pestering us too much. The flight attendants also did a terrific job.				A transpacific B777 flight returned to its departure airport when the right engine suffered a catastrophic failure during the climbout.

Our speed at the time was .77 Mach, at an altitude of 32,000 feet. We contacted the Flight Attendant in the aft end of the aircraft to ascertain what the cabin crew was experiencing. The Flight Attendant said that there was a continuous heavy vibration and shaking in the aft galley, extending all the way up to mid-wing area. The First Officer and I discussed and evaluated the situation, and determined the safest course of action was to descend into more dense air and reduce airspeed, suspecting a flight control problem. We contacted ATC, requesting FL 300 and reducing speed to .75 Mach. The vibration continued in frequency and intensity. We continued descent to FL 260, speed 270 kts, at which point the vibration decreased to continuous light vibration from the tail section. We had dispatched with yaw damper #2 inoperative, and we suspected at this point we may be experiencing a problem with yaw damper #1.In cruise, upon realizing a flight control problem, we used the QRH for any possible assistance. The only info provided there was to fill out the [standardized company] vibration form, found in the FOM. Maintenance Control also requested that I disengage the autopilot and put in control inputs to further assess the area of concern. I denied that request in the best interest of my crew and passengers. Thus far there is no known cause for the vibration. [I am] awaiting word from the Fleet Manager concerning maintenance's findings. Company radio was very unreliable when we needed it most. Due to the seriousness of the situation, typing our problem via ACARS would have been time consuming and would take one pilot out of the loop regarding the safe management of the aircraft.Maintenance's request that I turn off the autopilot and enter 'some control inputs' at cruise altitude was discomforting, to say the least. I refused their request, in the interest of safety for my crew and passengers. Please advise Maintenance Control that we don't 'test fly' an aircraft with passengers and crew on board. We were hoping for some further direction on alleviating our problem from the QRH. We found the information provided inadequate and of no assistance. We suggest adding to the QRH suggested airspeeds, Machs, and altitudes that may possibly reduce flight control vibration.We kept ATC informed of our flight control situation and they provided assistance as required. We informed Dispatch and Maintenance Control of our situation via company radio. Dispatch asked us if we were diverting. We informed them that we would continue to our destination unless the situation deteriorated. ATC, along with Dispatch, coordinated priority handling and we proceeded with no delays. Descent, approach, and landing were normal.				An A320 Captain reported unexplained aircraft vibration believed to have been related to the flight control systems.

We also had communication difficulties initially with Dispatch and Maintenance. During our climbout, shortly before 18000 feet, I lost all information on my PFD (Primary Flight Display) (attitude, airspeed and altitude). Shortly thereafter, we got an ECAM for an IR1 fault. I looked up and the switch was in the off position! This was then followed by multiple ECAM's for A/THR OFF, THRUST LOCK, YAW DAMP 1 (I think) and GPWS TERR. My First Officer was hand flying at the time and continued to fly. I worked through the ECAM's and switched my PFD to the No. 3 IR and displayed good information. I selected IR1 to ATT. When I reached the status page, I saw that both autopilots (AP) were inoperative (AP 1+2) as well as the yaw damper, GPWS TERR (A/THR?) and Cat 2. Both FMGC's seemed to be working with normal map displays that worked independently. We could select direct to a station but NAV would not engage (we had the dashed line on the map display). [We did a] position cross-check with the VOR's which we could tune with the RAD/NAV page. When we realized that neither autopilot would engage, I sent an ACARS to Dispatch to call me. I soon saw ACARS call on the upper ECAM, but could not retrieve the frequency from either box. Since I do not have an FOM in my ship set, I took the aircraft and radios while my First Officer looked up the frequency. We established a phone patch with Dispatch, although at first he could not hear us. We finally established the connection and described what was going on. The symptoms really didn't match anything. With one IR inoperative, we should have had the right autopilot, but we had none. Nor did we have either FD. There were No FMA's on either PFD. There was an FD flag on my side, and the FD flag was intermittent on the First Officer's side. We were hoping that Maintenance would have some ideas for a reset, but he was stumped also. He asked if we were ok to continue to destination; we conferred with Dispatch about any changes in en route and destination weather and decided we were ok to continue. We terminated the phone patch and were about to let ATC know our autopilot situation to see if we could continue at our altitude when the FMA's came back; we selected autopilot 2 and it worked, as did the auto thrust. We had no further problems during the flight. Before writing this, I saw that Maintenance deferred the DMC 3 and changed it. How would this have kept the autopilots from working? After reviewing the FM, IR faults, one can get loss of autopilots with one IR failure if the ELAC's (Elevator Aileron Computer) lack confidence in the other two IR's, but if this was the case, I think we should have also degraded to direct law. The crew coordination throughout this event was very good and once we established contact with Dispatch and Maintenance that went well also. In hindsight, probably should have let ATC know what was going on sooner. I knew that when I sent a call me to Dispatch and we didn't get back to him quickly, he would be concerned. I called once we were on the ground and he said was about to send a confirm ops normal. Since we were not able to retrieve ACARS messages for several minutes, we would not have gotten that one either.	The reporter does not have any idea how the switch came to be off but believes that it must have been on until just before the anomalies began to appear. He is certain that the switch was not touched by either crew member just prior to the event.			A320 Captain experiences loss of PFD information climbing through FL180, followed quickly by ECAMs for IR1 fault and multiple computer failures. IR1 switch is discovered to be in the off position. After switching Captain's PDF to the #3 IR and placing the #1 IR switch in ATT position systems return to normal and flight continues to destination.

I am deeply concerned with the condition of myself and my First Officer on this flight with regard to fatigue and sleep deprivation. This is only the second transpacific international flight in five years that I have flown that is unaugmented; this after multiple sleep disruptions, flying on the backside of our body clocks with consecutive circadian rhythm disruptions. We were both exhausted from the flight planning phase to the landing. It is of great concern that we are scheduled to fly these trips with no consideration to the cumulative effect of sleep loss. The only consideration is that this one flight is under 8 hours block to block as if we are coming from days off, fully rested. Its 7:48 block to block and an accident waiting to happen in my opinion. When both pilots unintentionally fall asleep at their stations, safety is seriously compromised. Clearly, this flight should be augmented. We have the ability to measure fatigue by cumulative sleep loss and circadian disruptions and this information should be used to consider the need to augment.

Notified A flight attendant of situation and that they could expect a normal landing with no need for a cabin advisory or need to inform passengers. Increased landing distance was calculated and found sufficient, as was no right engine reverser and no alternate brakes for backup. On approach aircraft was configured early for possible slow flaps/slats. Landing, runway clearing, taxi to gate and parking were all normal with the exception that the ramp hadn't notified anyone about the need to have the wheels chocked before the left engine could be shut down due to no parking brake. This was despite having been notified by dispatch, having been called by the copilot in the air prior to landing and again told by the copilot after landing.  Finally, ramp had been told to tell ground personnel not to open the cargo doors as there was no Yellow fluid or low fluid that may pump out on the ground.

I relaxed the tiller to natural thinking I was cross controlling the two.  I was still not able to track centerline with rudder inputs alone and came on with tiller.  I tried releasing the tiller when I was on center line and took over with rudder pedals alone and began tracking to the left of centerline. At this point I did an aborted takeoff, the winds were straight down the runway.  As I taxied clear I tested the rudders and the right rudder felt soft and did not provide the correct amount of authority.  I asked the First Officer to try his and he later commented that the right rudder on his side felt soft.	The reporter did not have any information to add to his narrative except to state that he felt the issue was rudder pedal control of nose wheel steering and not the rudder itself that was malfunctioning.

The First Officer maintained the 250 KTS and now being on an approach segment he started to slow to MASI flap up speed. At about 16 miles from the end of the runway and decelerating through 220 KTS, SoCal asked for our airspeed. I replied, '220 KTS,' and then we received a verbal bashing from the Controller that we were not assigned to slow from 250 KTS. He then proceeded to pull us off the approach to vector us behind the aircraft following us. He quickly gave us 4,000 FT altitude, a turn to the right 070 degrees.  Because of the verbal berating we missed the airspeed assignment of 180 KTS. The First Officer assumed that since he wanted 250 KTS, he began to accelerate. The quick change increased our workload and we completely missed the speed. We then slowed to 180 KTS. The Controller continued to berate us and then wanted to know, 'What kind of speed to expect from us?' He then assigned us 180 KTS to JETSA after re-clearing us for the approach. This speed is contrary to the ASAP and company tailored pages in the Commercial Chart Manual. The Controller insisted that his clearance to 250 KTS earlier meant that we were to maintain that until he told us to slow, but that was not the phraseology that we got. We were never told to, 'Maintain 250 until further advised.'  Therefore, with all the previous safety reports of unstabilized approaches, slowing through 220 KTS at 16 miles was not unreasonable to us. If we had to maintain 250 KTS at that point we would have had an unstablized approach. The Controller was unprofessional and used non standard phraseology. He felt that assigning the speed 250 on the arrival meant we were to maintain that on the approach segment as well. His constant verbal berating was distracting. If he had told us to maintain 250 that close would have been unrealistic and contrary to our operations and he needs to review proper speed assignments for the approach phase. I do not understand why the aircraft behind us could not slow and why it was so important to punish us verbally and removing us from the approach.		While flying the RIIVR Arrival into LAX, I was the pilot flying descending with the autopilot on and engaged in VNAV and LNAV. We were descending at 280 KIAS as per the restriction at GRAMM. I had set 280 in the descent page of the FMS and the speed window on the FMC panel was blanked with FLT PATH showing on the FMA. At some point after GRAMM we were handed off by Center to Approach. Approach advised us 'Air carrier X, reduce speed to 250 KTS.' using those EXACT words. I selected speed intervention and set 250 KTS. During the arrival the Captain and I monitored the aircraft progress. I remember commenting on the fact that the FMS profile seemed to want to slow to flaps up maneuver speed rather far out and commented that I would stay in Speed Intervention as a result. At some point, I cannot recall exactly where, the Controller cleared us via the RIVER transition and then cleared us for the ILS 24R approach. No speed assignment was given. I maintained 250 KTS. Approximately 20 miles from touchdown I began dialing back the speed in preparation for configuring and landing. At 17.6 miles from touchdown ATC asked, 'Air carrier X, say speed.' The Captain replied, 'Slowing through 220 KTS.' ATC replied, 'Well, I assigned you 250 KTS. Since you can't do what I told you I am breaking you off the approach.' He then shot off rapid fire instructions to turn to 340, descend to 4,000 FT and expect vectors. In point of fact: 1.) he had never assigned us 250 KTS - rather he had merely told us to slow to 250 KTS (from 280 KTS) way out on the arrival and then later cleared us for the approach. In my mind that meant speed was at my discretion. 2.) 220 KTS (and slowing) at 17 miles in a -700 is not unreasonable and is no different from what I have seen many times flying into LAX. In response to ATC I disengaged the autopilot, turned, and continued descending. In a response to his harping about speed, I let the aircraft accelerate to 250 KTS, having locked that number into my brain as I tried to process what had happened. I apparently heard, but did not process the 180 KTS assignment mixed into the heading, altitude, and editorial comments. Presumably the Captain went through a similar moment of shock [not processing] the 180 KTS assignment. As we turned the Controlled said, 'Because you can't follow instructions expect a 10 mile vector.' I was really ticked at his tone, angry at what had happened, and still trying to recall exactly when I might have missed the 250 KTS assignment. The Captain tried to politely assert that we hadn't been given a speed and that we were on the approach segment with speed our own discretion. ATC replied angrily that he had assigned us 250 KTS and rather than argue the Captain did not reply. At this point I had stabilized on the new heading and altitude, but at 250 KTS. At which point ATC said, 'Air carrier X, you didn't maintain 250 when I assigned it now you aren't maintaining the 180 I assigned. Tell me what speed you are going to fly since you cannot follow instructions.' I was stunned at his tone. The Captain merely said, '180,' as I rapidly slowed the jet. The remainder of the approach proceeded normally with 1 or 2 more sarcastic remarks by ATC; all in all very unprofessional behavior by ATC.		B737-700 flight crew inbound to LAX on the RIVVR2 STAR reported unprofessional controller behavior with regard to speed assignments, taken off the approach and re-sequenced.

Being vectored for the ILS 23 at BUF, we were on a 060 outbound heading paralleling the localizer course on the north side. We were given a clearance to descend to 2,500 FT. Upon reaching we were given a right turn to 210 to intercept, maintain 2,500 until established, and cleared for the ILS 23. Captain selected approach mode on the MCP and turned the heading selector to 210 degrees. We were 6 miles from the runway and slowing. Captain called for and I selected flaps 5. At this point I saw we had not intercepted the localizer and that the glideslope indication was erratic. At about the same time, 3 things happened simultaneously, we intercepted the localizer, the aircraft pitch up to about 10 degrees attitude and we climbed. I said, 'Watch your pitch attitude.' The Captain did not disengage the autopilot and the aircraft pitched slightly down and then up abruptly to about 18 degrees approaching the yellow pitch limit indicator. I said, 'What are you doing?' He disengaged the autopilot but we had already climbed to 3,100 FT. All this happened rather quickly and we were just inside the outer marker and high. But we were able to become stabilized and on glidepath by 1,000 FT AGL by selecting flaps 40 and we landed normally. This was a confluence of miscues and lack of communication between the Captain and me. The ATIS indicated high scattered clouds, 3 miles visibility, rain, and mist so he briefed the full ILS 23 approach. What we both failed to brief or even notice was the special notice to Pilot's page immediately after the ILS 23 in the commercial charts. This page says not to engage approach mode until established on the localizer because the glideslope is unusable beyond 5 degrees north of the localizer course. The ATIS mentioned the part about the glideslope being unusable north of course as well. When we were being vectored, the visibility had improved to greater than 10 miles below 5,000 FT so we could see the airport the entire time. As we made the turn inbound I failed to notice that the Captain had engaged approach mode instead of localizer mode until intercepting the localizer. We were vectored very close to the outer marker and it seems we were inside of 5 degrees of the localizer at the time the aircraft started pitching up abruptly. But I should have pointed out that he had approach mode selected with the glideslope indicating erratically. The other miscommunication I had with the Captain was not suggesting he immediately disengage the autopilot at the first sign of unexpected pitch oscillations. He did so after the second pitch up almost to the PLI, but I was ready to do so myself if he hadn't. In the final analysis we should have been more vigilant and taken heed of the special procedures pages in the approach charts and the ATIS. Especially after a long day that was approaching 11 hours.		The initial pitch up caught me by surprise and I probably could have prevented the altitude gain by being more aggressive with flight control inputs. Since we were climbing, I didn't feel the need to panic and overcorrect. We were with Tower at the time and nothing was said about the approach. There is a warning page concerning this approach in our charts and it probably needs to be highlighted a little better. If approach is going to vector aircraft from this direction and if the ILS signal is a problem, mentioning this phenomena may help. This may help breaking habit patterns.		A B737 Captain engaged the autopilot Approach mode while on a southeast heading to capture the BUF Runway 23 ILS localizer. The aircraft pitched up as the glide slope fluctuated and climbed 600' before the autopilot was disconnected.

I was the First Officer. The Captain's brief prior to departure was unusual, and, as I remember, very different from the previous time(s) we had flown. Early in the brief, he said that he would accept input, but as the Captain he would make the final determination on any action, and as the final decision maker, he would in all likelihood end up doing what he wanted to do anyway. That is an almost direct verbatim quote. He went on to say that he wanted us to check with him prior to every radio call, change to the MCP, or FMS. He was emphatic that he would not tolerate a jet that was not smoothly flown, and if we could not fly it smoothly, then we ought to use the autopilot. He said we needed 'to fly the airplane the way the company wants us to fly it.' He also mentioned after engine start, the First Officer was to take the closeout, and go through the numbers with him. After engine start we taxied from the gate to the runway. When we were switched to Tower by Ground Control, Captain asked First Officer to go through the numbers, which he did. What neither of us evidently had a clear understanding of, is that the usual 'weights and temperatures check good, we have 240 people on board, security check is 'OK' was not what the Captain was looking for. He wanted the First Officer to go down the closeout number by number, so he could compare each number to the FMC. There were some fits and starts to this new process, as it was unfamiliar to both of us. (The First Officer did it exactly the way the Captain wanted on the return trip.) We did find a couple of errors in the FMC, which was good. What was less good is that we missed two radio calls from Tower, as the Captain had to emphatically state several times to the First Officer, 'read each number!' We did finally get through the takeoff data part of the checklist, after which the Captain went through the standard litany of how we were to handle aborts, and which runway we should come back to in the event of an emergency. This was hard to concentrate on, since I'm used to hearing it in the pre-departure briefing, Tower was telling us to take the runway. We then took off without incident. The Captain flew a very smooth airplane.The Captain did not come to the hotel that night, so there was no opportunity to discuss anything with him there. Last night, in the pre-departure briefing, the Captain asked me to request FL380 (instead of the flight planned FL340) from clearance. This was approved. The Captain stated that 'it's hard to get higher sometimes, and you can get stuck.' Upon engagement of the autopilot passing FL200, the Captain thanked me for flying a very smooth airplane. At level off, we had about 130 KTS of headwind, and the 'optimal' and 'recommended' altitudes in the FMC were FL350 and FL360 respectively. On a couple of occasions the Captain talked to the Controller in Spanish, not only to say 'hello' but to give position reports, etc. While I speak Spanish, I could not help but think about a First Officer who wasn't a Spanish speaker, and again, how he would be out of the loop. After about 45 minutes at cruise, I said: 'the reason I asked you yesterday whether you had some issues with previous First Officers, is that your pre-departure briefing may result in you getting less input than you might otherwise want from them. I'm sure your intent is not to shut that input out. A discussion ensued on this matter, with him reiterating that he was in command of the aircraft, he was the Captain, it's not a democracy, it's a dictatorship, and that really is just the way it is. I told him I understood his position of authority, did not question it, and suspected that the vast majority of First Officer's didn't either. But what I took away from the brief was that: 'It's my way or the highway' and I thought it created an environment that was less than optimal, and in fact, unsafe. He told me he calibrates his briefings to his audience, and that if I had been a 'new First Officer' that he would not have felt the need to be so emphatic about his command authority, and that in the old days, when he was a First Officer, it was: 'yes Captain, yes sir, etc. The issue of flaps 25 came up, and how some First Officer's had resisted his demand that a flaps 25 approach and landing be flown. (It was only then that it became clear to me that he expected me to do this as well.)I took the second break, and when the Captain returned from his break, we were nearing our initial descent point. There was some radio chatter on ATC frequency about deviations around weather, and on my radar presentation there were some returns just to the northwest or out intersection. I asked the Captain: 'what do you think, go around to the east?' He said something to the effect that I was on too great a gain, that his scope looked fine, and that we would be OK. As we neared the intersection, and leveled off at 10,000 FT, I asked him if we could query ATC if anyone was deviating around weather to the north of the intersection. He said something to the effect 'I'm okay with it.' I took this to mean that it was okay to ask ATC. I need to be very clear here; in no way did I interpret his comment to mean that no radio call should be made. I just wanted to have a comfort level about the weather, and it wasn't part of my thought pattern that he would deny me that. I then asked ATC: 'has anyone been deviation to the north of the intersection?' They answered in the negative, and that one of our airplanes had just gone through without incident. I felt comfortable at this point that we were in good shape. At that moment the Captain, enraged, put his finger inches from my face, and yelled at the top of his voice: 'Don't you ever do that to me again! Don't you ever, ever do that to me!' He went on to say some more things at the top of his lungs, rising out of his seat towards me, with his finger still in my face. My only response was: 'please take your finger out of my face.' He replied with' I'll put my finger wherever I want.' A short discussion ensued as to what exactly he was upset about, (it was the radio call I'd made) and when I told him that it was clearly a misunderstanding because I thought he'd given me de-facto permission to talk to ATC he replied with: 'you knew exactly what you were doing.' That of course meant that I had, in his mind, directly violated an order. At that moment we broke out of the weather and the lights of the city were clearly visible. He shouted: 'See, there is the city just like I told you!' I did not engage by raising my voice, and I think I said that we should talk about it later, and the subject was dropped.My overriding concerns:1)This Captain is on a hair trigger regarding Captain's authority. My 'insubordinate act' caused him to lose control in the cockpit, act verbally and physically aggressively with me, and endanger the operation. Had I been on a similar hair trigger, the situation might have easily devolved even further. 2) In spite of his statement during the initial brief that he flies the aircraft as the company wants us to fly it, I think the numerous events of this sequence do not bear that out: the non standard takeoff briefing, non inclusion of the First Officer during FMC edits, requesting non-FMC or flight plan altitudes, exclusion of the First Officer during planning, and entirely disregarding First Officer's input or concerns. In fact, I cannot think of a single time that any of my suggestions, offers to help, or input, were accepted. They were usually completely ignored. 3) I generally disregard other pilot input regarding eccentric Captains, as my experience is that I am able to fly with most anyone. That said, during this sequence, no fewer than four pilots said 'sorry' or something to that effect, when they found out that I was flying with this Captain. Clearly this Captain has established a reputation, and it isn't good. 4) This Captain's personal life may be bleeding over to his professional life. Suffice it to say that his personal life is 'complex' and leave it at that. While a strong reaction to perceived insubordination might be appropriate (in this case, after landing), the extreme nature of the incident suggests to me that outside factors are at work.				B777-200 First Officer describes a two leg international trip that leads to a near altercation with the Captain during arrival on the second leg. The Captain apparently believed the First Officer had been insubordinate.

As he stood up, his head struck one of the agent toggle switches on the cargo smoke overhead panel. Approximately 15-30 seconds later, the 'smoke fwd cargo smoke' ECAM appeared momentarily. After further observation we noticed that the 'DISCH1' light was illuminated on the cargo smoke panel, indicating that the 1st bottle of smoke retardant had been fired into the forward cargo pit. After reviewing the Flight Manual and discussing the situation, we determined that the ECAM was the result of retardant being inadvertently discharged into the forward cargo pit. Upon taxi-in the second bottle automatically discharged itself into the forward cargo pit. Once parked at the gate we were met by a Maintenance Supervisor. After our debriefing with the Maintenance Supervisor, I spoke to Flight Operations and was told sufficient action had been taken on our part, but we should still file a report.		With approximately 45 minutes remaining I made arrangements for personal lavatory needs. Anticipating the Flight Attendant, I slid back my First Officer crew seat and stood up. As I did the top of my head made inadvertent/unintentional contact with the overhead panel. I briefly looked up to see if any switches or knobs were mispositioned. Not noticing anything out of the ordinary I continued to the back of the cockpit near the door. (It should be noted there was no injury to my head and no remaining pain because the bump was light and brief.) Just as I reached the back of the cockpit the ECAM warning sounded. When I turned to see what it was I saw a red ECAM message but it quickly extinguished. Recall attempts by the Captain at the controls were unsuccessful. He scanned various ECAM pages and all appeared normal while I let in the Flight Attendant then returned to my crew position to help assess the situation. As I returned I noticed an illuminated light on the overhead panel near where I bumped my head. It was DISCH1. We pulled out the Airbus Flight Manual and looked up the exact meaning of the light: Cargo 1 agent had been discharged. We then reviewed and discussed the situation: I must have inadvertently bumped the guarded agent discharge switch with my head; agent was discharged into the cargo compartment; as the agent discharged the cargo smoke detectors detected the agent and sounded the warning ECAM; when the agent stopped discharging the air cleared and the ECAM no longer reported an anomaly. The Captain and I were 100% certain there was nothing requiring an immediate landing and we elected to continue to our destination. While enroute we contacted Maintenance Control via ACARS and told them of the situation. We requested ramp be notified to NOT open the pits, a mechanic meet us at the gate and only with the mechanic's instruction should the pits be opened. Furthermore, the Captain and I discussed the likelihood the second bottle of agent would be released upon landing. During taxi in, I contacted Ramp AND Maintenance to once again ensure the pits would NOT be opened without specific instructions from a qualified mechanic. Both sections ensured me all parties were notified. Upon arrival at the gate we were met by a Maintenance Supervisor. We explained to him the above and asked what was needed from us as follow-up. He said as far as he was concerned we had complied with all requirements.	The reporter states that this particular A320 had an older switch design that was actually a switch and not a recessed push-button. The guard was also quite different from the current design, which allowed this incident to occur.  The reporter was advised by maintenance that accidental discharge was quite common, thus the new design.	A320 First Officer reports inadvertent contact with the guarded cargo agent discharge switch while standing up to leave his seat at cruise altitude. Bottle one is discharged causing a momentary ECAM warning.  Bottle two automatically activates during taxi in.

We note the increased landing distance is not a factor on the 16,000 foot runway plus a 19 knot headwing component. Captain clears the ECAM and reports ECAM complete, screens normal. Continue approach to a normal landing. Turn off the runway and taxi to the ramp. Notified Maintenance and they found a severe leak in the left wheel well.

It was too hazy and dark for us to pick up the river in time.  We were vectored around to the LDA approach.  We quickly reviewed and briefed the approach and commenced the approach.  The visibility was poor, though legal, for the approach.  It was very difficult to see the visual landmarks and do the circling part of the approach.  We were very aware of avoiding the prohibited areas and may have inadvertently strayed too far west.  It was VERY difficult to see our exact position as it was after midnight on a very dark night with haze.  I had never done this approach in my 30+ years of flying and we were both very fatigued.   We made every effort to fly the approach correctly but this was, by far, the most difficult approach I have ever flown in my 5 years on the Airbus.  I do not feel that the Commercial Chart pages and depictions are adequate for a night approach by someone unfamiliar with the airport and the extremely difficult approaches, especially at night and in reduced visibility.  This approach should be a simulator training approach instead of a very simple NDB!				A320 Captain describes difficulties encountered during the LDA DME 19 approach to DCA. The approach occurred late at night in reduced visibility and was the first time for this reporter. Reporter believes that simulator training should be required prior to flying the actual approach.

On the dogleg base leg we were instructed to reduce speed to 160 KTS and then 150 KTS because they placed us only 3.5-4 miles behind the Airbus. We were told that there is a Citation Jet on final to 28L behind us that had us in sight. At no time did we report that aircraft in sight, nor were we asked to do so. The Citation was to follow us. Inside the San Mateo bridge, and having reduced to final speed of 140 KTS and fully configured, we were told to switch runways to 28L and that the Citation behind us would be switched to 28R. We were at around 800 FT on final to 28L fully established and configured. I noticed that there was TCAS traffic almost directly above us and slightly behind us. Shortly thereafter we received a TCAS RA. Upon landing we were instructed to telephone the Tower. We spoke with the Supervisor who asked us if we were filing a NMAC report. We said we would only file a company report. The Supervisor said that SFO Tower and the Citation had no issues. I thought they would actually apologize. This was very poor handling from SFO ATC for placing us so close to the Airbus and placing a light jet so close behind us. The TCAS target was so close behind us, that the actual TCAS depiction showed him practically directly above us with almost no lateral separation. Unfortunately this has become standard procedure at SFO.				B777 at 800 FT and assigned Runway 28R SFO described a conflict event with a light jet when ATC initiated a last minute runway change resulting in the light jet directly overhead, the reporter noting this was becoming standard at SFO.

An area of weather is shown by the radar overlaying our route from east to west. After some discussion about the best route around the weather, a request is made by CPDLC to deviate left of course up to 20 NM. Clearance is received at XA24z and we deviate to the full 20 NM left of course. As we approach the weather, it continues to develop and extend. The individual storm cells begin to become one solid line that forms somewhere on the left behind us and extends diagonally to our 2 o'clock position. Lighting is visible and frequent. At XA30z we make a request to deviate now to the right of course 30 NM and the aircraft is turned to the right back toward the center line of the airway. At XA32z our request is denied because of traffic, but we are cleared to deviate left for 30 NM. At XA33z we inform ATC that we are unable left deviations, that we must deviate right and reiterate our request for right deviations. There is no response by CPDLC.We continue our flight toward and across the airway centerline. Along the way, we turn on all exterior lights and begin to broadcast on guard Pan Pan Pan, approximate position, altitude, and deviating for weather. We discuss changing altitude, but end up remaining at our assigned altitude and monitoring TCAS. At some point during this time we receive a call from ATC on guard to not enter restricted airspace. Subsequently at XA44z, we receive a CPDLC message 'UNABLE, RIGHT SIDE, DUE TO AIRSPACE RESTRICTION.' We are already clearing the corner of the weather and are turning back to the airway. We report over guard that we are clear of the weather. At XA52z we are uplinked a message to report back on route and request a position report. At XA54z we CPDLC a back on route report.		The aircraft was traveling at 506 KTS approximately eight and a half miles per minute or 92 miles between request and response. The crew had no option, but to deviate for safety of flight.		A B777-200 flight crew took emergency avoidance action in oceanic airspace to circumnavigate thunderstorms when they were unable to get a timely clearance to do so.

We immediately observed the pressurization controller panel and it indicated normal per its placarded schedule. We ran the QRH and again observed the pressurization controller. It was on schedule. Even though the QRH indicated that continuing to destination was safe, I felt like something physically was off that I don't normally experience. My ears were abnormally popping and I had unusual sinus pressure. I mentioned this to the Captain as we continued the climb to our cruise altitude of 40,000 FT. We also discussed that if the door was open, that the pressurization of the aircraft should force the door(s) closed per how out it was constructed/seated. Also, I told him that all doors were closed per my preflight of the aircraft. Around 30,000 FT, I still felt unusual pressure in my ears and sinuses and the Captain also said he felt physically that the pressurization felt off and it just didn't feel right even though it was indicating on schedule via the indicators.This was when we both decided to level off, contact Dispatch, and divert to a nearby airport to have the door and pressurization checked since it was only eighty miles ahead on our planned flight path. Even though all was indicating normal, except for the illumination of the Equipment light, we both felt like the aircraft's pressurization system was not functioning properly. We decided it was best to divert and err on the side of safety. We were also not sure if something else might be wrong with the pitot static system. Upon landing, the Equipment light extinguished.Both E and E doors were closed when inspected. We called Maintenance and they advised us that this plane had a history. Also, they instructed us that Contract Maintenance should be contacted to inspect the doors and pressurization system. They were called and came out to inspect. When doing so, the most aft E and E door was very hard to open and the lever seemed jammed. The Maintenance Technician was able to open it with much effort, inspected the pressurization system via faxed instructions, and all tests indicated normal. The door then seemed to open and close with ease and the Equipment light illuminated when opened and extinguished when closed.Along with Contract Maintenance, we MEL'd the door light, loaded the aircraft, and took off to our scheduled destination. We did not experience any abnormal pressurization issues physically like the flight prior and the light never illuminated throughout flight.The Captain and I both agree that before we made the decision to divert, we should have radioed Maintenance Control and advised them of the situation. And, we should have gotten any pertinent information that could have further helped the evaluation to divert or keep going. This would have been very beneficial. Hindsight is always 20/20. I still think that we made the right decision giving the physical signs that we both experienced.				A B737-700 diverted to a nearby airport when the Master Caution and Equipment Cooling Door warning lights came on.

I asked him again and he informed me the frequency and identifier were located on the PFD. I asked him for a third time and he pulled out his publications binder and 'half' followed me through the approach and then put away his binder with an 'attitude'. Last month I had a similar incident on arrival when an First Officer informed me he didn't need to pull out any publications during my brief. After explaining company SOP he conformed and I had no further problems during the four day trip. In June, I had a similar experience prior to approach with an First Officer who would not pull out any publications during the entire flight. Is this a trend and are other Captains having these problems? I'm not back in the Air Force flying a single seat aircraft. This is a dangerous trend of First Officers deliberately being cocky, complacent, and arrogant. I strongly believe flight standards should issue a bulletin to Airbus pilots explaining the seriousness of this matter especially at airports they're familiar with.				A320 Captain believes that some First Officers at his company are becoming complacent and are not complying with SOP when it comes to approach briefings.

It appeared to be a slow leak, but also thought it might be due to cold soaking. While monitoring the situation, I sent an ACARS message to Maintenance explaining the quantity indication was approaching the low level amber box, but no response. Sent another message asking if anyone was home and still no response. Contacted Dispatcher and he established a VHF conference call. All parties agreed we would be prepared in case the Green System failed. Instead of waiting for an ECAM to appear, we decided to be proactive and review the irregular procedure for Green Hydraulic Low Level, accomplish the performance computations and brief the Flight Attendants on the potential of a cabin advisory in advance. Upon initiating our descent received an ECAM for Green Hydraulic Low Level and accomplished the procedure. I then notified ATC of our issue and after a brief discussion with the First Officer, elected to declare an emergency as a precautionary measure. We then sent an ACARS to Dispatch and Maintenance confirming our mechanical problem and briefed the Flight Attendants on a cabin advisory, followed by a PA to the passengers informing them of situation and what they could expect. Fortunately, when we turned the Green Hydraulic Pump back on, per the ECAM, we regained enough hydraulic quantity to put the landing gear down, land without incident and taxi to the gate. CFR followed us to the gate and the flight was complete at this point.  NOTE: I felt the entire crew, Dispatcher, ATC and CFR all performed extremely well, but with respect to Maintenance I have some concern. Throughout the majority of my career, Maintenance was considered to be a valuable resource and the technical experts we could rely on. I do not find this to be the case anymore, especially with the individual that was on duty during this event. Unfortunately, Maintenance Control has become extremely inconsistent, depending on which controller we draw for the day. This is a non-emotional comment and I strongly believe this issue needs to be addressed. Also prior to our landing, ATC departed a heavy aircraft, which left behind some wake turbulence we had to confront during flare. Had we been dealing with a controllability issue, this would not have been a good situation. I called the Tower from my hotel that evening and briefed them on what had transpired.				An A320 Captain reported losing Green hydraulic system fluid in cruise flight.  They ran the procedure, and after coordinating with Dispatch and Maintenance decided to declare an emergency.  A normal landing was made although they encountered some wake turbulence on short final.

The initial approach was normal and we were vectored to intercept the final while given a descent clearance to 1,600 FT and being asked to maintain our speed (185 KTS) until 5 miles out. Upon receiving the approach clearance, I armed the approach and immediately noted FINAL APP annunciated on the FMA. At that point the aircraft began to climb to 2,000 FT to capture the descent path. As pilot flying, it seemed to me that the aircraft didn't start the final descent at the top of descent point so I disengaged the autopilot and autothrust concurrently and started descending toward the PAPI approach path while configuring for landing. I attempted to reach stabilized approach criteria as quickly as possible but at 1000 FT AGL I was target +20 KTS and sinking 1,200 FPM with thrust at idle. At the 500 FT gate I was stable on speed and sink rate (target + 8 KTS, sink 900 FPM), but with the thrust still at idle (I had NOT re-engaged autothrust). I was maintaining the PAPI glide path to 100 FT when simultaneously the First Officer (pilot not flying) and I became aware of our below target airspeed while receiving almost immediately afterwards the LOW ENERGY WARNING. I responded by placing the thrust levers at TOGA to limit any further decay in airspeed and arrest the rate of descent. The resulting touchdown was firm and in the landing zone but otherwise uneventful. Taxi-in and parking was normal.I have endeavored to closely follow SOP's throughout my career and take my responsibilities very seriously. I know the aircraft Pilot Handbook and FOM well and follow their guidelines rigorously and yet failed to conduct the approach described herein properly by neglecting to adhere to some of our most basic principles. In conducting the approach setup for the VOR-DME, I failed to utilize the QRH as an aid believing that I was proficient from having flown numerous VOR approaches in Mexico recently. I may have inadvertently failed to clear present position while flying the approach which may have caused the aircraft to climb to 2,000 FT instead of continuing the descent to the FAF altitude in open descent. The aircraft response certainly increased my task loading, but my response in disconnecting the automation removed a barrier that would have prevented the unstabilized approach that resulted. When the aircraft failed to descend at the expected point in the approach, my reaction in disconnecting autothrust was instinctive but ill-advised since as stated, it removed a barrier but also was not pre-briefed and is not authorized at night. Our descent below 1,000 FT AGL while unstable should have resulted in a go around with plenty of time and fuel to conduct another approach. Finally, inadequate monitoring of the flight instruments by the pilot not flying removed the final barrier that would have prevented the decay in airspeed. Very simply, my event should cause all of us to rededicate ourselves to following SOP's and guidelines as published in our manuals. My appreciation for the barriers which serve to prevent bad consequences and outcomes has increased immeasurably. Our job can become so routine that we fail to adequately recognize when an abnormal or non-routine situation has put us 'into the yellow', and even two well-trained, conscientious and diligent professional pilots can make mistakes. The Pilot Monitoring has to monitor, even on beautiful clear nights and, most importantly, has to know what to monitor.				A320 Captain reports receiving a Low Energy Warning at 100 FT AGL during a night VMC approach. Autothrust was disengaged when the aircraft did not responded as expected when capturing the VOR DME approach path. TOGA thrust was used to prevent a very hard landing.

We entered the clouds maybe 5 minutes earlier. We felt the aircraft change attitude and noticed that VNAV was disconnected, along with the altitude (ALT) and auto speed (A/S) readouts not even close. There were the associated 'ALT disagree' and 'A/S disagree' warnings on both displays. My altitude reading was FL312, while the First Officer's was still at FL320, but diverging. His auto speed reading was dropping and settled at 190 KTS, plus or minus 20 KTS, while my airspeed was stable. We verified with ATC our altitude, airspeed and ground-speed readouts from him, and he said we were still at FL320, and at a constant speed. Not being sure if we could maintain RVSM, or even close, we asked for a block altitude and received the block FL320-330. We later expanded our request to FL310-330. The Co-pilot was hand flying at this point, since the autopilot disconnected. He was flying off his altitude display and my airspeed display at this time, I believe. He was doing a very good job of flying, especially considering we were verifying our instruments with ATC and going with the 'best info' off the most correct readout. At this point, I declared an emergency. I felt we could not maintain RVSM standards, and we had way too much incorrect information to check, cross-cockpit, and as far as we could tell, we had major instrument problems! We checked the overhead panel and verified that all probe heat was on and all switches were in the correct positions. It was during this check, we found the EEC (Electronic Engine Control) 'ALTN' (alternate) lights ON in both the engine 1 and 2 switches. We accomplished both the EEC FAIL/ALTN Checklist and the Display Source Checklist. We came out of the clouds and within about 2 minutes the readouts started to return to normal, but we could see that we were going to go back in again. We started down for warmer air and asked for FL240 initially with clearance to deviate as necessary, but we reentered the clouds and the instruments again diverged, so we asked for lower. We ended up at FL200, where the SAT (saturation) was -09. We remained clear of the clouds, and were able to remain that way for the duration of the flight. We landed at the planned destination with all instrument readouts seemingly back to normal. It is my opinion [that] had this event occurred during colder weather operations, in the clouds, and/or IMC conditions during the approach and landing phase, this may have resulted in a more serious event! As an aside, we had a jumpseat occupant who said he had been on the 737 for many years and for all our work and checklist work, said he 'could find nothing to add to our efforts'. The First Officer was flying the aircraft for the leg and did an outstanding job under the confusing circumstances and landed as the winds were approaching 30 KTS. He did a great cross-wind landing, and I would like to make sure he is commended for his work, assistance and professionalism during this event.	The reporter stated that he had this aircraft two days in a row. After the first event an emergency was declared and maintenance was performed on the aircraft. He believes, but is not certain that the pitot tubes were changed for the next day's flight. On the first flight of the next day the same anomalies occurred, but an emergency was not declared because the crew understood what the indications were and the weather was mostly VMC. The first time the malfunction occurred the flight crew felt a slight bump like they were about to enter a mountain wave and so became alert. Shortly thereafter they saw the autopilot and autothrottles had disconnected without alerts. Then they noticed the airspeed and altitude discrepancy developing at which point they notified ATC of the issue and decided that they could not stay in RVSM. The Reporter believes that either a pilot tube heater was weak and permitted ice build up or the pilot tube static drain was plugged. He was not aware of any codes stored in the computer nor was he able to determine which pilot system was malfunctioning.			A B737-800's Captain's altimeter and the First Officer's airspeed as well as both engine's EECs developed anomalous behaviors at FL320 in cruise with all other systems appearing normal. During descent into warmer air the system errors dissipated.

ECAM's were accomplished and APU was started. Descent to lower altitude and uneventful landing at destination coordinated with ATC.		Reporting due to a loss of the autothrust system. Primary fault was loss of Generator Bus 2 failure (out of phase). We tried to restore the generator by cycling (per ECAM) and lost it again, then used APU generator. Could not restore autothrust. After the trip found that this problem was in the Flight Manual (supplemental section). That procedure contradicts the ECAM. Maybe this needs to be highlighted.	This reporter states that this anomaly is covered in the supplemental section of the Flight Manual and that an attempt to restore the generator should not be made. This procedure is in opposition to the ECAM actions.  Once the APU was up and running all electrical buses were powered and the flight continued to destination.	A320 flight crew experiences Generator 2 failure in flight and attempts to restore operation are ultimately unsuccessful. Generator 1 is unable to power AC Bus 2 which remains unpowered until the APU is started.  Flight continues to destination.

On the ground in ZZZ2 the power cord was removed prior to the APU running. On the Airbus this causes numerous electrical problems ECAMs, warnings and cautions. Once the electrical power was restored and the screens were normal (this took several minutes) we did a check of all the systems and all appeared normal. What we later learned was that apparently the NAV system defaulted to the standby navigation mode with only minimal indication and some abnormal indication it had done so. Once airborne and on climbout we received a NAV accuracy downgrade, followed shortly thereafter by an IRS NAV only message. We were unable to enter anything into the RAD/NAV page. After protracted troubleshooting with Dispatch and Maintenance Control we made the decision to divert to ZZZ in order to do a ground reset. ATC did declare us an emergency aircraft although we did not request it. ZZZ was chosen as the divert airport as the weather was clear there while it was IFR with CBs at our destination.				An A320 flight crew diverted to an enroute airport when their navigation system reverted to IRS NAV only and they were unable to program their route.  A power interruption at the gate prior to departure may have initiated the anomaly.

VMC conditions for takeoff from longest Runway, XXC with an adequate stop margin and YXC with a slight headwind component.  Standard power used.  At 140 to 150 KTS a hawk glided right-to-left under the fuselage and toward the left engine.  The First Officer was pilot flying.  The crew observed the bird, which was ingested into the left, number one engine.  After rotation and gear retraction, I asked the Relief Captain to secure number engine bleed to alleviate the strong smell from the bird strike.  I reported the strike on the Tower frequency and asked that they do a FOD check of Runway XXC at about the two-thirds point.  All operating parameters were nominal - with the smell previously noted.  I secured the left AC pack to allow the odor to purge from the cabin air supply system on the affected side.During initial climb, the left engine N1 vibration presented an index of 1.3 v 0.7 for the right engine.  No clunk, thud, nor any other effect was detected at ingestion.  We knew that a significant portion of this perhaps 3.5 or 4-pound bird had entered the hot section of the engine, and subsequently the bleed system.  The left engine vibration indication decreased to 0.7 after about 20 minutes of flight.We informed Dispatch, and Maintenance Control.  Airport Operations advised several (nominally) 4x4 inch pieces of a honeycomb material, later identified as from our airplane, had been recovered from the Runway in the vicinity of the bird strike.  We returned to ZZZ in agreement with our Dispatch Department.  As part of minimizing the landing roll, we declared an emergency and coordinated a fuel jettison with ATC at FL290.  We briefed and performed a near-maximum landing weight landing, following a gradual, early descent, with a gradual reduction in power on both engines.  Auto-brakes and single reversing using the right engine only, resulted in a fairly long landing roll on Runway XXC.  The emergency crews visually inspected and confirmed no abnormal condition of the left engine, and we taxied normally to the gate.  Upon shutdown, Maintenance stated that more honeycomb, acoustic material had exited the exhaust of the left engine.  Post-shutdown visual inspection, presented damage to the fan section acoustic shroud honeycomb material.  Feathers were also present on several of the leading edges of the fan blades.				A B777 ingested a bird in the left engine at high speed on the takeoff roll resulting in damage to the engine.  Flew crew successfully returned to the departure airport.

We were being vectored around a lot of weather and ATC was extremely busy. We needed to have ATC repeat our clearance several times. She was working extremely hard and we increased the controllers' and our workload! This is a safety of flight issue.				A B737-700 Captain reported the altitude alert warning was bleeding through into the pilots' headsets and was interrupting clearances that then had to be repeated.

Engines surged twice in a very short period of time at approximate 90 KTS and we also experienced ECAM Warning. At that point the Captain took command of the aircraft and rejected the takeoff at approximately 100-110 KTS. Advised Tower of a rejected takeoff and when the aircraft came to a complete stop the Captain advised passengers that we had discontinued our takeoff and please remain seated. Next we communicated with Tower and they asked if we needed assistance. First Officer told Tower we do not need assistance, but we would like to have our landing gear brake assembly looked at by the fire department to make sure there was no smoke or fire. We reviewed the immediate action items and determined hot brakes was the only one that applied. Ran the procedure and then proceeded with the ECAM actions, which were advisory in nature only. Followed up with the ECAM handbook. After the fire department gave us the okay, we continued to the gate and we advised maintenance and operations and told them our brakes were hot and to keep ramp people away from that area until they cooled. The cause had something to do with the right engine fuel control and possibly the FADEC.				A320 First Officer reports engine surge during the takeoff roll. Captain assumes control and rejects the takeoff at 110 KTS.

Some ACARS messages were being sent and received but the system was slow and often displayed 'NO COMM'. Maintenance was notified via the radio of the two write ups. As I went through my preflight checks, although not required since it was not the first flight of the day, I performed the fire tests on the engines, APU system, and Cargo Smoke Detector system. I routinely perform this test on every new aircraft I get into as I have observed an occasional unsatisfactory test on the Cargo Smoke Detection system. On this particular day, the Cargo Smoke Detection system did not test properly as outlined in the flight manual when after pressing the Cargo smoke test button for 3 seconds, the associated lights and warning bells only cycled though once versus the proper two test cycles. I called maintenance on the radio approximately 30 minutes prior to departure and notified of the test failure. When the mechanic arrived, I again ran through the test sequence with him and we together verified that it was only testing once versus the required two test cycles. I told him that it appeared that one of the channels on the detector systems was inoperative. He said that he would look into it and would return with the required paperwork since ACARS was now inoperative. We started to receive some ACARS messages and one of them was from dispatch advising us to amend our release to show that the ACARS and the CHNL 2 smoke detector was inoperative. I was expecting maintenance to defer the Channel 2 and that we would be OK to continue as is. Shortly before our scheduled departure time, he returned with the maintenance release and said that he had difficulty getting all the paperwork done because the computers in the maintenance kiosks were also inoperative. I asked him if he needed to do a test of the system through the MCDU unit and he said that it was not necessary since the system had been deferred. He asked us to place the required deferral stickers in place and then left. As I looked at the maintenance release I saw that the write up said Gripe: 'Smoke Det Channel 2 will not test' Action: 'Complied with MEL.' We then pushed back, taxied out and departed normally. Approximately 30 minutes after departure we received a message from Dispatch advising us that we should return to [departure airport] since there was a concern that the Cargo Smoke detector system had been improperly deferred and that we may not have smoke detection capability. I contacted Dispatch via ARINC to verify that he wanted us to return and to make certain that the proper system had been deferred. He advised us to return to [departure airport] to make certain everything was in proper working order. We then advised ATC that we would need to return to [departure airport] due to a potential system malfunction and that we would like to have emergency equipment standing by since we would be landing overweight and I was concerned about potential brakes overheating. We returned to [departure airport] and landed at a weight of 147,500 with a normal descent rate and at a speed of approximately 140 KTS. Minimal braking was used. The emergency equipment met our flight as we taxied off the runway and after they verified that all was normal, we taxied to the gate.		While preparing for departure, the first item that happened was the ACARs showed NO COMM shortly after initialization. While waiting for it to come back I decided to go outside and do my exterior inspection. While outside I noticed the Left Wing Scan light was inoperative. When I got back to the cockpit, I noticed the ACARs was still inoperative, so I notified MX that I had two Write-ups but could not send an MRM. I gave them both write ups verbally, and proceeded to continue my pre-flight duties. When the Captain came in he discovered that the Cargo Fire Suppression System was not testing properly. It was only cycling through one channel. The ACARs had been intermittent throughout our preflight, so we verbally notified MX about the Cargo Fire Suppression System also. After a few more minutes the mechanic came on to the flight deck. He told us the Wing Scan Light and the ACARs were deferred. After pushback the ACARs started working, so I checked the release verification. It showed Release 2 as valid and the MRD as being current, I did not actually read the new MRD. Push back, taxi, take off and climb were normal. At cruise altitude we got a message from Dispatch that we had left with an improper deferral. The entire Cargo Fire Protection System was deferred. There should have been no cargo loaded in either pit, the lavatories should have been closed off and unusable. The combination of factors definitely contributed to the mistake. The intermittent ACARs made communication with Dispatch, and Maintenance more difficult. The mechanic also told us he was having problems with his computer. I think he was having to find a computer he could use, and still trying to get things finished in order to have an on time departure.		An A320 departed with a Cargo Smoke Detector System MEL deferral but was recalled to base while at cruise because the system may not have been properly deferred and in fact rendered completely inoperable.

At Vr, I slowed my rotation rate in the hopes of staying below the birds. Immediately after lifting off, I saw a large bird off my left side. We felt the bird strike the aircraft and immediately felt a surge and a strong vibration coming from the number one engine. Raising the gear, we continued straight ahead. At 400 FT we advised Tower of a bird strike and the need to return to the airport. All engine parameters on the number one engine were normal. We leveled at 2,000 FT performing standard post departure clean up and power reductions. Setting a speed of 210 KTS, we entered downwind with Tower clearing us to land. My First Officer briefed the flight attendants and the passengers. We landed at approximately 151,000 LBS. The landing was smooth and without further incident. I chose not to use reverse on the number one engine and shut down the engine immediately after touchdown. Airport authorities said the bird appeared to be a Huron. Markings suggest the bird struck the number one engine nacelle at the five o'clock position. There was no damage to the nacelle, but significant damage to one fan blade and damage to two additional blades. After saying goodbye to the passengers, I debriefed the flight attendants. My First Officer and I then debriefed, reviewing our own performance deciding it would not have hurt to declare an emergency and have equipment standing by.				A320 Captain reports hitting a large bird just after lift off causing initial engine vibration. The crew elects to return to the departure airport.

[The restored] course seems to conflict with raw data so we continue flying raw data. First Officer does fantastic job backing me up. Flight lands without incident.	The reporter stated that the radios were set for the LOC/ILS and so when the FMC screens blanked he had to tune the VOR, dial the outbound radial, prepare for a DME arc on the new arrival and fly raw data while avoiding thunderstorms in the area. His anxiety level went from about a three to a ten. When the First Officer finally restored the FMC it was not reliable because the displayed course and terrain were not where the raw data and the crew's visual terrain contact showed them. So a map shift had occurred. In addition to the FMC problem, weather and the transition to raw data, the TCAS alerted a TA for opposite direction departing traffic which the crew was attempting to see visually. Both FMC's were pulled from the aircraft and sent out for examination. The Reporter's Chief Pilot believed that a software issue caused the problem. The FMC had version 10.6 of the operating system installed.	Descending into a mountainous airport and clearaed for the arrival. Overhead the arrival NAVAID Approach changes clearance to a different arrival. Pilot flying inputs the arrival from arrivals/departures page and both FMC's go blank.

The vehicle entered the runway heading west then turned south onto the runway and exited the runway at the next high speed. When I saw the truck enter the runway, I told my Co-pilot to call the Tower and tell them that a truck was on the runway. We were about 200 - 300 FT above the truck when we passed over it. The truck was not an immediate problem because of the distance down the runway, but could have been a major problem had it been on landing roll or had they crossed at a more critically closer taxiway to us. Suggestion, have transponder equipped vehicles to help Tower identify vehicles that have access to active runways and taxiways.				DFW Air Carrier departure noted vehicle traffic entering runway as they overflew the traffic, the reporter suggesting ground traffic be required to be transponder equipped to reduce like events.

I do not believe we received any priority handling, however the fire/rescue equipment did follow us upon landing.  Landing was otherwise uneventful.  My understanding from the post flight maintenance report is that there was an autoflight ELAC2 fault, as well as an ELAC2 Aileron 'order disagree'.  We changed airplanes and continued uneventfully to our original destination.		We could have gone into the closest field; however, doing so would have been a rush and I would have had to use flight control drag devices at high speed which I didn't think was prudent.

After completing takeoff check list we proceeded with QRH and ECAM procedures, while continuing with the departure I advised ATC that we have a flight control problem and we will be leveling off at 10,000 FT and a 060 heading for an extended downwind with a return to airport. Initially trim wheel had become frozen; from 8 to 10,000 FT we were able to move trim wheel and level aircraft off at 10,000 FT. After level off we reviewed QRH/landing performance. We notified Flight Attendants of a slight problem with the flight controls and [that we would] be returning to the airport, a normal approach and landing anticipated, passengers were also notified in this manner. After an uneventful landing we were instructed to taxi on Whiskey hold short of Taxiway Zulu.  Aircraft was determined safe and taxied to the terminal without further incident.	The Captain reports that initially the stabilizer trim wheel could not be moved but approaching 10,000 FT they decided to force it with positive results. The aircraft remained in Alternate Law all the way to landing with trim being adjusted via the trim wheel. On post flight it was noted that the stabilizer was in the full nose down position. The Captain states that the cause of the jammed stabilizer has not been revealed to him.			A320 Captain reports a jammed stabilizer shortly after takeoff with numerous ECAM messages and the aircraft reverting to Alternate Law. Control of the stabilizer is eventually regained using the trim wheel and and the crew returns to the departure airport in Alternate Law using manual pitch trim.

Just after level off at FL400, we heard the pressurization horn sound. We immediately performed the memory items and donned our O2 masks. We then started the Abnormal Pressurization Checklist. We requested a turn toward the nearest suitable airport. We declared an emergency and requested an emergency descent. The cabin continued to climb to approximately 13,500 FT cabin altitude. The passenger O2 masks did not deploy. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and I was the Pilot Monitoring. I ran the checklist and communicated with the passengers and the Flight Attendants. The landing was uneventful. We had the fire department do a cursory drive around. We then taxied to Gate. Paramedics met the aircraft and two people were transported to the hospital complaining of ear pain.				A B737-700's Cabin Altitude Warning Horn sounded while the aircraft was level at FL400. The memory items were completed, an emergency declared and the aircraft diverted to a nearby airport where two passengers were given medical attention for ear problems.

We leveled off, took care of the problem, and declared an emergency. We requested a turn back toward ZZZ1 in the process (thinking long runways, good emergency support, and close field). The Center began giving us a descent and vectors. Once we had the initial parts of the Emergency Checklists and coordination with the Cabin Crew completed, we asked about the weather in ZZZ1. Hearing the weather was poor (low visibility in fog), we decided ZZZ would be a more suitable divert field and requested a turn toward ZZZ. We were still somewhat high for a stable approach into ZZZ1 at that point, so ZZZ worked out well for getting down. The weather was better in ZZZ allowing for a visual approach, rather than the high probability of a single-engine ILS approach in ZZZ1. We didn't know the forecast trend in ZZZ1 either. As I approached ZZZ, I was finally able to speak to the passengers directly about our intentions. The Flight Attendants had briefed them prior to that. Unfortunately, our workload was high, completing all the necessary checklists, so answering Dispatchs' ACARS message wasn't accomplished.I usually check the weather in ZZZ and ZZZ1 prior to departure, but for some reason today I didn't. That would've made me more prepared for a last-minute divert. I wish I had made a quick PA right after the initial engine failure was under control; letting the Passengers know that the plane will fly fine on one engine and that the good engine was working fine. I later heard that the Passengers were pretty nervous given the loud, explosive nature of the event, combined with vibration and noise. We were task saturated and did our best, but that's an area where I personally feel I could have done better. I could've had the First Officer make a quick call to ZZZ Operations just to let them know we're coming and to notify Dispatch of our intentions.		On climbout, at approximately FL240, we heard a loud bang and a loud buzzing sound with left yaw. The Captain leveled the aircraft and announced accomplishing the checklist items. The Captain told me her initial plan was to turn around and land in ZZZ1. I declared an emergency and was directive with ATC about our plans. Once it was determined that ZZZ1 had weather near minimums the Captain got the weather for ZZZ (we could see it and tell it was VMC). We completed the checklist items and landed uneventfully in ZZZ. My issues were with time compression and prioritization of cockpit duties. It was not as pure as a simulator event (they never are). It became a balance of accomplishing checklist items and talking with Cabin Crew about what they were seeing out the window, as well as changing the box for navigation and landing location, getting weather, continued analysis of the event with the Captain, and talking with ATC. The Captain kept us on the right pace and we had the checklists complete with a complete plan through post landing items while on downwind. There just wasn't time to bring Dispatch or Operations into the loop.		B737 Flight Crew experiences an engine failure passing FL240 in the climb. The departure airport has short runways and the first choice for diversion has low ceilings. The second choice is VFR and the crew diverts but is unable to inform Dispatch in advance due to time constraints.

We acknowledged to ATC we saw him and then we received a TCAS RA to descend. The First Officer smoothly clicked off the auto pilot, pitched down to match the RA VSI bar and reduced the throttles to ensure we did not overspeed. Simultaneously I told ATC on the radio we were doing an emergency descent and following a TCAS RA command. The opposing aircraft flew right over us and we estimated it was less than 800 FT. We had descended to FL365 when the TCAS announced clear of conflict. We climbed back to FL370, re-set the auto pilot and auto throttles and told ATC what happened and that we were back on track. The seat belt sign was on because we had just transited some turbulence. No passengers or Flight Attendants were injured, although after the flight the Flight Attendants inquired about the pitch down.		While cruising at FL370 and deviating around a line of thunder storms (HDG 100) we were given traffic information at 12 o'clock FL380.I believe the other aircraft was military since they were not on the same frequency and had a non-airline call sign.		While deviating around weather an A320 received a TCAS RA with respect to an apparent military aircraft traveling the opposite direction.

We were forced into an unstable approach with the weather down. Following the flight I called Approach Control. They indicated they have a problem with BFI missed approach traffic and cannot clear any traffic below 3,200 prior to the Final Approach Fix.

We were at 4,000 FT at 250 KTS when we were cleared for the visual. I deployed the speedbrakes, descended to 2,000 FT, and slowed to 210 KTS. With a tailwind of 65 KTS at 2,000 FT and a very bumpy ride, I (by mistake) started configuring for landing with the speedbrakes still deployed.		We were flying a visual pattern in night VMC. The surface winds were 220/15G20. On the downwind, we had 65 KTS of tailwind at about 2,000 FT AGL. I was the pilot not flying. The speedbrakes were out and we were flying a proper pattern for the wind conditions. I normally arm the speedbrakes for landing at about 210 KTS preparing to configure for landing. On this approach, I was paying a lot of attention to the wind (calling it out to the pilot flying) and ground track and gave a PIREP to the Tower of the wind vector. The pilot flying called for flaps at proper speeds. We configured to landing flaps (30) and both realized the speedbrakes were still deployed. It was bumpy and the airspeed was fluctuating +/- 5 KTS. I stowed the speedbrakes, accomplished the Before Landing Checklist, and we landed. At the gate, I called Dispatch and Maintenance to make sure we didn't need to make a logbook entry. It was the last leg of a four-day trip and I think we were both a little fatigued and not as sharp and attentive as usual. The turbulence and unusual windy conditions made it hard to feel the slight rumbling of the speedbrakes deployed with the flaps. I think in the future, before I call for the first flap extension (or move the flap handle for the pilot flying, I will re-check that the speedbrake is armed for landing. This will prevent this from happening again.		A B737 crew reported that after configuring the aircraft to flaps 30 for landing they realized the speedbrake was still extended.

We had been working this issue on and off since shortly after rotation. The First Officer was pilot flying and Captain was pilot not flying. Captain did a great job of communicating with all parties concerned. The flight attendants also did a great job of taking care of the passengers' concerns. The emergency occurred because a steering servo broke. Our experience with Maintenance Control during this event was less-than-stellar. We had noticed in both the QRH and in the Non-Normal Supplemental Handbook that with this fault we might also encounter a Shock Absorber Fault upon gear extension. When Maintenance Control was queried about what to expect, they had no idea that this was a possibility and, in fact, told us that the fault would be a non-event. They were quite surprised when we informed them otherwise. We were quite disappointed in the fact that Maintenance Control did not appear to have either reference book lying open in front of them and that they would speak off-the-cuff when advising a crew.				An A320's nose wheel steering servo failed and caused a WHEEL N/W STEERING FAULT ECAM. When the landing gear was lowered the SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT ECAM alerted so an emergency was declared prior to landing. In flight maintenance technical support was minimal.

It lasted 2 or 3 seconds and stopped at gear retraction. No further vibrations or noises were heard. About one hour into flight the 1st Flight Attendant told us a deadheading Flight Attendant sitting in Row 5 said she saw a black object the size of a hockey puck fly off the aircraft toward the side of runway. At that time we suspected we may have tire damage and may have been the 'noise' [we heard]. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance and advised both of our situation. We all agreed that we should continue to destination and land. Dispatch also contacted the Tower and arranged for us to get the longest runway. Dispatch also notified crash and rescue that we may have a damaged tire and our ETA. Upon first contact with Approach we declared an emergency, but they were already aware of our possible problem. We landed normally and taxied clear of runway. We asked CFR to inspect our tires and they informed us the right side inboard tire was blown. At the same time we noticed the brake temps on right gear of 45 degrees on inboard and 520 on outboard tire. We advised CFR of the high temperatures and to use caution around the gear. We then called Maintenance and they advised it would be safe to taxi to gate. We turned on brake fans and taxied slowly to the gate. It appeared the number 3 tire had blown on rotation during takeoff.				Airbus Captain reports being informed by a deadheading Flight Attendant, one hour into the flight, that a tire may have failed during takeoff. Precautions are taken during approach and landing at destination. A right main gear tire is found to be flat.

Passing 2,500 FT received 'monitor vertical speed' RA followed immediately by 'adjust vertical climb' RA. Pilot not flying saw a Cessna pass directly overhead at 3,500 FT. I leveled the aircraft at 2,900 FT. Notified NCT of RA and our altitude and asked about traffic. NCT stated it was a Cessna, 'VFR at 3,500 FT.' Received amended clearance and continued. In the future, do not clear an IFR aircraft into direct conflict with known VFR traffic.		Departing 28L SFO Shoreline SID. Tower gives 3,000 FT altitude clearance. After switching to NCT Departure, given 15,000 FT clearance. At about 2,500 FT get Resolution Advisory; monitor vertical speed, then adjust vertical speed. Captain (pilot flying) leveled us at 2,900 FT. Cessna passed directly overhead, right to left at 3,500 FT. Asked ATC if Cessna was supposed to be there; response was: 'Yes they are VFR 3,500 FT (there is no VFR corridor in SFO to my knowledge, so they were in Class B). This was likely a Controller error. Very close! TCAS works! This all happened very quickly; Captain did a great job responding to RA.Be vigilant, always looking for traffic. If ATC gives initial low altitude clearance, then one should be thinking about other traffic passing above and be aware, both inside (TCAS) and outside (visual). Lots of new controllers coming on line; be careful out there!		Air Carrier departure from SFO described a TCAS RA event shortly after take off on the SHOR1 SID, noting ATC had re-assigned an interim altitude (3000 FT) just prior to the event.

ECAM, once screens recovered, showed HYD Blue SYS Lo Pressure. The blue pump switch showed a fault. ECAM directed to PNF to turn off Blue pump. ECAM also directed, among other things, to turn off right no 1 fuel pump, Avionics cooling blower fan, and directed DMC to be selected to Captain. ECAM also directed to apply landing distance penalties and procedures. The status page told us the following were inoperative: NWS, Blue HYD Sys, Spoiler 3, Yaw Damper, Cat 3, RT Fuel pump no 1, Flaps/Slats slow to extend, Apply landing procedures, etc. While performing ECAM and analysis, we turned direct destination and declared an emergency.		While enroute at FL370 approximately 30 minutes from destination, we had the following malfunctions: Capt PFD, ND, and upper ECAM screen began blanking. Multiple ECAMS appeared with the top ECAM being HYD B sys lo Pressure. This was due to the failure of the HYD B ELEC pump. As the Captain flew the aircraft, I began to work the ECAM procedures. After completing the ECAM's, we decided it was prudent to declare and emergency and proceed direct to destination. With one hydraulic system failed, and the electrical system continuing to blank screens and switching sources, we wanted to land as soon as possible. Center gave us clearance direct to the airport and we landed approximately 20-25 minutes after the first ECAM. On the status page we had a NWS inop message, so we coordinated with Dispatch to have a tow available after landing. We cleared the runway and were towed to the gate. A full description of the events was given to the 5 mechanics on the jetway upon blocking in.	The reporter states that the electrical failure indications in the cockpit were only of an AC bus #1 failure. He does not recall an indication of a generator #1 failure. He is not aware of what maintenance action was required to return the aircraft to service.	A320 flight crew reported electrical anomalies approaching top of descent. Malfunctions included Captain's PFD, ND, upper ECAM screen blinking, and HYD B lo press among others. An emergency was declared and the flight proceeded direct to destination for a normal landing.

Approaching the next waypoint, I meant to select VNAV and Speed Intervention at 210 KIAS, but inadvertently hit Level Change at 210 KIAS instead. Climbing rapidly toward the 7,000 or below restriction, I saw that VNAV was not engaged and, in my haste, selected VNAV again. Desiring a 210 KIAS climb speed, I meant to select Speed Intervention 210 KIAS but repeated my previous systems error and reselected Level Change a second time. Of course we flew through the restriction and leveled late at about 8,000 MSL, and then descended back to 7,000 just to or beyond the fix. The First Officer stated I confused him with what I was attempting (VNAV/Level Change) and by the time he realized I meant VNAV/Speed Intervention, we were sailing through the restriction. My error was not as much a lack of systems knowledge as it was not watching which button my finger was pressing under the time constraint. The First Officer and I both discussed the need to speak up and coordinate more assertively, fly, and monitor.		They assigned us a climb clearance, 'Climb to FL190 and comply with the altitude restrictions.' I was the pilot not flying and read back the clearance. I then set the Altitude Alerter to FL190, and restated the clearance out loud to the Captain, who was the pilot flying. He acknowledged the clearance and pointed to the set altitude. He was utilizing the autopilot to fly the aircraft. Before takeoff he selected the autothrottles and LNAV modes so I thought that he was fairly knowledgeable of the LNAV/VNAV/autothrottles use. This was our first leg ever flown together. We were relatively light and climbing at 210 KTS so we had a good climb rate. I stated again that we needed to comply with the altitude restrictions, at or below 7,000 FT at the next waypoint. The Captain then switched to VNAV, then back to Level Change 210, and then back to VNAV. He left the autopilot in VNAV for a couple of moments so I thought we were in a good mode, but then he switched back to Level Change and dialed in 230. Then he went back to VNAV. I repeated that we need to make the crossing restriction, and he nodded but didn't say anything and changed back to Level Change 210.This surprised me as I had previously thought that he was trying to accomplish some convoluted way of accelerating the aircraft smoothly to 250 KTS and then engage VNAV, as he kept engaging VNAV and then switching out of it for Level Change. Also, as I monitored our progress on the MFD, it appeared that this method would work to keep us below our at or below 7,000 FT restriction.But when he switched back to Level Change 210, it increased our climb rate so much that it took us close to our altitude restriction. I again reminded him of our 'at or below restriction.' The Captain then switched off the autopilot and manually flew the aircraft as we climbed through 7,600 FT and leveled for a moment at 8,000 FT. He started to descend a bit, but realized we were past the waypoint and needed to climb for the next restrictions being 'at or above restrictions.' We continued on. The Captain later described to me that he wanted to use the Speed Intervention function, but having not flown in the past eleven days he had had a lapse in judgment and accidentally used Level Change. He apologized for the error. We did not have any traffic conflicts.		A Captain of a B737-700 fumbled with the autoflight mode selections on climb out and failed to meet a crossing restriction on the SID as a direct result.

Maintenance reset the fault and we were on our way.  While at cruise FL380 the CAB PR 2 faulted again.  A few minutes later CAB PR 1 faulted and we followed the ECAM to descend immediately.  While putting on the oxygen mask there were a pair of reading glasses stuck inside my mask, which I didn't figure out until about 5 minutes into the process.  Then the O2 mask fogged up and I had to clear the mask. These two events definitely made the process a little more involved.  The cabin never went above 8000 FT and the passenger masks never dropped.  We took off our masks at 10k FT.  Captain coordinated with Dispatch, Flight Attendant's, and Operations.  I worked with ATC mostly.  I felt as if it was just like training (calm, not rushed-just do the right thing) and we were both in the loop as to what the other pilot was doing and it became uneventful because of that.				A320 First Officer reports a CAB PR 2 fault during preflight, which is reset by Maintenance.  In cruise at FL380 CAB PR 2 faults again, followed shortly by CAB PR 1. The crew initiated an emergency descent and diverted.

Took vectors to work through problems. Set field elevation manually and restored FMGCs. Aircraft showed 'CAT 3 dual' with a good id, but never coupled [and] strayed off course, no glideslope.  Performed go around and from QRH surmised unable to shoot CAT 1 to minimums required for weather conditions with the available equipment. In communication with Dispatch, ZZZ had better than 1000/3 and we diverted to ZZZ.		Flight was proceeding normally until approaching destination. When being vectored to final approach the First Officer asked if he could clean up the flight plan. I agreed and as he started to clean up the screen, the FMGC was lost resulting in the loss of map info both left and right. The ECAM displayed something to the effect 'set field elevation manually.' We asked approach for a delay vector as we worked to restore map/ILS guidance. After approximately one minute the FMGCs returned, minus all flight plan/performance information. The First Officer worked to put pertinent info back into the 'box' as I flew the aircraft. With no clearcut direction we assumed that we had proper info back. When approaching the final again, the flight director/autopilot did not capture the course/glide slope. I turned on the standby navigation and the ILS in an attempt to establish a working ILS that we could fly. The frequency was correct, the course was not. The information was unacceptable for a stabilized approach. The First Officer and the Company Jumpseat rider called for a go around. We missed and climbed to 5000 FT where we declared an emergency and started looking for suitable alternates. The company Dispatcher was contacted and ZZZ was selected. After a initial course correction at ZZZ on the stby ILS, we received an ASR approach. The First Officer preformed a uneventful landing. CRM worked extremely well. The First Officer and the Jumpseat rider helped bring a successful conclusion to this event. None of the standard ECAM direction was available for a quick resolution to this problem. FOB was a concern as we were working the problem, as I have a desire to land with more rather than less FOB. Cause. Maintenance problem, followed by lack of clear cut direction. Not using the QRH.		A320 flight crew experiences dual FMGC failure during preparation for an ILS.  The FMGCs are restored and reloaded, but the crew cannot get the autopilot to track the LOC or the glideslope.  Crew diverts and attempt to use standby NAV ILS is unsuccessful.  ASR approach to landing ensues.

During cruise at FL380 we once again encountered and advised Maintenance of a SYSTEM 2 PRESS FAULT. Approximately 5-10 minutes later we experienced a SYSTEM 1 PRESS FAULT, followed by an ECAM directed emergency descent. We followed the ECAM guidance and requested an immediate descent to 10,000 FT with Center. Due to terrain, the Controller could only clear us to 12,000 FT, which required both pilots to remain on oxygen while coordinating with each other, Flight Attendants, Dispatch and turning on the seatbelt sign. With the weather being completely VFR and unlimited visibility, we requested a descent to 10,000 FT and would maintain our own terrain separation. ATC cleared us to descend and track off course if necessary. At this point communications became much easier after removing the oxygen mask, which had fogged up. The First Officer flew the aircraft and talked to ATC, while I discussed the situation with the Flight Attendants, confirming the cabin oxygen masks did not deploy and no injuries to crew or customers. After briefing the passengers on what had transpired my focus then turned to coordinating a plan with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. Based on terrain analysis and fuel planning, we were able to continue to our diversion airport. Everyone on board was told of our intent and the station was well prepared for our arrival. The First Officer and I created an arrival strategy using all of our available resources, including the FOM Diversion Guide. Maintenance Control indicated he would log the items in the maintenance computer for us, knowing it was a busy time. We landed without further incident.				An A320 flight crew received ECAM pressurization system pressure warnings for systems one and two. The ECAM directed an emergency descent so the crew declared an emergency and diverted for maintenance.

Dispatch advised us the weather shouldn't be a factor but we have an alternate due to a low ceiling and we can't pick up additional fuel because we were at our maximum takeoff weight.  We were dispatched with 40,100 LBS of fuel.  Departure, climb, cruise and initial descent were normal.During the initial descent we received holding instructions and an EFC (Expect Further Clearence) of XA45Z.  We sent an ACARS to Dispatch with the holding information and an FOB of 10,000 LBS.  We briefed the need to exit the hold and proceed to our alternate by time XA57Z or 6,700 LBS fuel remaining.  Destination ATIS indicated: wind 190/17G24, vis 9 SM, SCT 007, BKN 031, BKN 140, BKN 250, 22/20, altimeter 29.71.  ATIS at our alternate indicated: wind 220/12G17, vis 10 SM, SKC, 25/14, altimeter 29.65.A short time later we were cleared to leave the hold and continue our STAR and we sent an ACARS to Dispatch advising them.  During the descent and arrival the instrument approach was changed three times, from the left runway to the right and then back again to the left.  ATC vectored for the approach behind a heavy foreign carrier ahead of us on the approach.  We contacted Tower when established on the approach and were cleared to land.  Passing 1,000 FT on the approach we heard the Tower multiple times giving taxi instruction for the foreign carrier to exit the active runway.  Each time the carrier replied inaccurately. At 500 FT the Tower instructed us to Go-Around due to traffic conflict on the runway.  ATC vectored us around for another ILS approach.  We were positioned behind several arrivals on downwind at 4,000 FT where we advised the passengers about the Go-Around, the conflicting traffic on the runway and advised them we should be landing shortly.Reviewing the fuel situation on the downwind leg the fuel was around 5,700 LBS, we briefed the need to declare Minimum Fuel if ATC delayed our vectors.  We were still on downwind behind several arrivals with no sign of vectors towards final approach.  We declared Minimum Fuel with around 5,200 LBS fuel remaining and briefed the need to declare Emergency Fuel if ATC further delayed our vectors.  After we called ATC to expedite our approach without any resolve we declared Emergency Fuel with around 4,500 LBS fuel remaining.  Immediately ATC started vectoring us towards the final approach, handed us over to Tower, cleared us for an approach and cleared us to land.  The approach and landing were normal.  Upon touchdown we had around 3,700 LBS fuel remaining and taxied to the gate on aircraft own power with no further assistance needed.				An A320 Flight Crew departed on a transcontinental flight already concerned about their planned arrival fuel.  Weather, traffic congestion and an ATC directed go around at their destination due to traffic on their runway precipitated an Emergency Fuel declaration and expedited arrival handling.

After checking the landing data, we proceeded to ZZZ, performed a QRH directed flaps 15 landing, canceled the emergency, and proceeded to the gate.  We were met by Maintenance and CFR.

First Officer ran QRH procedure for fuel imbalance. This led to QRH procedure for suspected fuel leak. Shutdown left engine per checklist. Declared emergency with Center, completed in-flight shutdown, prepared cabin crew and passengers for single engine divert to a nearby field. Notified local Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighters to be standing by. Executed RNAV approach. Uneventful landing; stopped on runway for Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighters to inspect aircraft. No leak found; tugged to gate. There was a time delay in being informed if there was a leak by the local Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighters due to no ground to cockpit communication. The information had to be relayed by the Tower. This led to some initial confusion but was quickly resolved by opening the cockpit window to get their attention.		On climbout, initially cleared on route, then vectored for traffic separation. After clearing traffic and being cleared back on route, we noticed a fuel imbalance and IMBAL annunciation. Captain stopped climb at FL270; imbalance about 2,000 LBS with left quantity decreasing rapidly. Declared emergency with ARTCC; initiated divert to an airport about 60 miles away. First Officer performed IMBAL QRH, led to FUEL LEAK QRH, which led to in-flight shutdown. Fuel still decreasing from left side, but now slower. Finished those checklists, one engine inoperable QRH, and normal checks while descended in holding [pattern]. Shutdown second engine on runway and received tug to gate.	The reporter stated that because the route of flight offered few suitable diversion airports the crew did not have the luxury of extensive troubleshooting, although they discussed doing so but quickly realized the situation was changing too rapidly. The fuel was decreasing about 100 pounds every 30 seconds and after deciding to divert things happened very quickly. Because there was no corresponding increase in another tank quantity they assumed a fuel leak and responded accordingly. After landing no fuel leak was seen and the only available Mechanic used the wing fuel tank sticks to check the quantities and discovered that the mechanical readings agreed with the cockpit gauges. The crew was puzzled by this and stayed with the aircraft to further investigate the problem after everyone else went to the hotel. In the end, with no obvious fuel leak the only conclusion they could come to was a fuel system error which allowed an incorrect fueling prior to departure.	A B737-800 IMBAL annunciation alerted on climb out. A rapidly decreasing left fuel quantity led the crew to complete the QRH FUEL LEAK procedure, shut the engine down, declare an emergency and divert to a nearby airport.  Allegedly, a fuel system emergency led to incorrect fueling prior to departure.

During the approach, the drizzle was heavy enough to obscure the front windscreens and make it difficult to see the runway. Using the windshield wipers did not improve the visibility appreciably. The wipers were old and left gaps in which no water was removed from the window. We made a maintenance log entry for the windshield wipers, but the windscreens did not shed water enough without the wipers for clear visibility out the windows. The drizzle dissipated enough prior to landing to allow us to land the aircraft safely. The windows should be checked for permanent rain repellent coating capability as they do not seem to work very well in that respect.				A B777 air carrier pilot reported the windshield wipers were ineffective during an approach and landing.

As we were contemplating either taking evasive action or querying Tower, we received a TCAS RA to climb, which we complied with. The other aircraft turned towards the correct Runway 1L, and the RA went away. We were able to continue the approach and land with no other issues. The approximate range was 300-500 FT vertically and 800-1,000 laterally.		We were cleared for visual, as we were descending through about 2,200 FT, aircraft lining up for 1L overshot their turn and came into our flight path. We got a TCAS climb. First Officer initiated climb, I advised Tower about TCAS climb. Once clear of conflict, we continued approach without further incident.

It reduces visibility to the point where you have to look out at a corner of the window where the wipers have cut a path. And even then the wipers perform marginally. These approaches and taxiing with limited visibility due to rain repellent failure is not getting any better. The solution here is to reapply this repellent and give us our windows back. This not a safe condition.				A B777 Captain reported the rain repellent/windshield wiper system was inadequate to provide appropriate visibility during an approach in moderate rain.

For the next 3 hours we would receive conflicting information on our level of failure modes. My FMA displayed 1FD2, AP2, and my MCDU illuminated the FM1 light along the top row indicating per the FMS2 Pilot Guide that FMGC1 had failed. I would have anticipated my FMA to have shown 2FD2 but it did not. A little later my FMA showed '-FD2' and then again later show 1FD2 while both FD's remained on. On the MCDU scratch pad I would occasionally show 'independent operation' or 'opp FMGC in Progress'. When we were done with the weather radar we tried to select TERR but were unable to select further indicating failure of FMGC1. My MCDU could operate the ACARS but not the FMGC on either side. I had to look cross cockpit to use the First Officer's ND and use his MCDU to input information. On the data page FMGC1 showed blanks for lats and longs. All other indications of location were close and agreed with raw data off VOR's. We reviewed system resets and per the procedure we did not touch any circuit breakers for FMGC's since we were airborne. We did however locate all applicable circuit breakers in the event we would need to reset them later. We studied the FMGC dual failure irregular checklist and the additional procedures for standby navigation in the event FMGC2 would fail. I tested my RNP's ability to manually tune VOR's and ILS's on the ND which it did. I never did get any ILS indications on my PFD which I thought I would have at some point. Additionally, we turned off both FD's for 5 min to see if we could get FMGC1 to re-synch with no luck. We then contacted Dispatch to advise and got a phone patch with Maintenance Control to discuss. He confirmed that we had done all that was available and with the good weather decided to continue on to destination. Things were pretty much routine until turning an 8 mile final for 27L ORD. The First Officer turned off the autopilot and autothrust. At the time we were in HDG and VS -1200. We were set up for the ILS with the ILS 27L in the flight plan, both FD's on, LS buttons selected on with the correct data showing on the RAD page. He asked for the approach mode which would not arm. I tried the LOC mode and that would not arm as well. We remained in HDG and VS -1200 down final. I tried de-selecting my FD and LS and using just raw data on the ND while in the ILS mode and still could not get approach to arm. At around 700-800 FT got an ECAM for CAB PR- LDG Elev Fault. I set the landing Elev manually per the ECAM. Later at about 400 FT I got a MCDU scratch pad note indicating I had lost my speed target on my speed tape and to reference the VLS indication. We were indicating about 135-140 KTS. and that sounded reasonable. The First Officer later reported his speed target appeared normal. After landing normally we confirmed that the outflow valve had indeed opened properly before pulling up to the gate. Reflecting back if I were to see an FMGC failure like this in the future I would not continue on into adverse weather as we were limited to a raw data approach at the destination. In a similar scenario I think it would have benefited us to pull the circuit breaker for FMGC1 forcing a complete shutdown of FMGC1 instead of what appeared to be partial and inconsistent operation of it.				An A320 Flight Crew reported multiple and varied autoflight and FMS system anomalies which they were unable to correct. Despite this they continued to their destination. Fair weather enroute and at their destination contributed to the decision to continue.

There were no high speed abort item indications. In flight, we discovered that we left the probe heat switches off, which we then turned on. Also, both engine EEC's [Engine Electronic Control] were in alternate mode. We ran the QRH procedure and selected alternate on the EEC's switches. We suspected that the probe heat switches off triggered the EEC's to automatically switch to alternate. No engine parameters were exceeded and the EEC's reset normally at our destination.Checklist discipline; review abort parameters and procedures.				B737-800 First Officer reports forgetting to turn on the probe heat switches prior to takeoff after returning to the gate for maintenance.

We performed the ECAM checklist, QRH and follow up. Initially we fixated on the yellow electric hydraulic pump switch on/auto positions not the PTU on/off switch. The PTU was subsequently intermittent and then failed. We performed the loss of yellow system pressure ECAM/QRH procedures. We declared an emergency in perfect VMC conditions, descended and turned back toward the airport. The green system intermittently indicated overheat during the turn. The Flight Attendants and cabin were notified of the upcoming precautionary landing and time. Distance and speed adjustments from the QRH were checked for the approach and landing. When flaps were selected, only slats 3/flaps 0 were available. We made a left turn in the pattern as green/blue pressures were still good to recheck new distance requirements and reference speed adjustments. When turning final again the gear did not release from the uplocks when selected down, so we manually released it and it quickly extended and locked. The aircraft was over the fence at adjusted Va with a good touchdown and near normal deceleration. We were rolling slowly by 5,000 FT, and continued slowly to near a far end turnoff and set brakes. We made a P/A to the passengers and Flight Attendants that we were fine but that we would be towed into the gate. We instructed the emergency crews to stay away from the landing gear until the tires cooled. The left pair (with reverser and upwind) was less than 300 degrees C. The right pair (no reverser and downwind) was in the mid 500 degrees C. The fans were turned on and the right pair came down to the mid 300s C prior to tug arrival. The aircraft was towed to the gate. The passengers were upbeat during deplaning and there was no immediate apparent injury or mental trauma. During our post-flight debrief we both looked up at the hydraulic panel at the PTU on/off switch where it had been the whole time and realized our procedural error.Enroute an o-ring in the yellow hydraulic system failed rapidly dumping all yellow system fluid overboard. Needless to say, I will probably live the rest of my life with heightened hydraulic system awareness. Two thoughts come to mind, however: 1. If desired, a following note could be placed in the QRH after the loss of yellow system fluid checklist directing the crew to perform the loss of yellow system pressure ECAM, indicating that if this ECAM checklist was not present that the loss of fluid checklist was not complete. 2. A spot event could be flown during recurrent training, not involving the whole hydraulic system loss scenario, but merely the initial step of selecting the PTU off, so the crews have a look at that never-used switch. The electric yellow hydraulic pump switch is used once or twice per leg during normal operations to inhibit PTU operation. This might be of some value to other crews.				An A320 experienced Yellow Hydraulic Reservoir low level ECAM at FL350. ECAM procedures were complied with except the PTU switch was not turned off. The flight diverted. During approach only slats extended and the gear was extended manually. A no flap landing ensued with a tow to the gate.

During takeoff roll, I had just announced '80 KTS, thrust set' when we received an ECAM for left engine compressor vane. Captain aborted takeoff (his takeoff) and I advised ATC of our abort. We exited the runway and the Captain instructed me to tell the cabin to remain seated via PA announcement (which I did) and then began to run the ECAM while the Captain was clearing the runway, now at a safe taxi speed. ECAM required left engine shutdown which was accomplished as we were joining the parallel taxiway. We set the parking brake and completed Flight Manual checklist and review of problem. Captain contacted Dispatch and advised them of our abort and coordinated a return to gate.		During preflight briefing the First Officer and I discussed possibility of left engine compressor vane occurring on take off because of the extensive history noted in flight papers. As we accelerated through 80 KTS the left engine compressor vane ECAM came up. As pilot flying I immediately called 'aborting, call ATC' and executed the abort at approximately 85 KTS. Autobrakes engaged and as we slowed through 60-70 KTS I disarmed the autobrakes and directed First Officer to make PA for passengers to remain seated as we exited the runway. Brake temperatures did not exceed 500 degrees.		A320 flight crew noted during preflight that the aircraft had a history of stator vane problems. During takeoff ECAM announced left engine compressor vane fault and the takeoff successfully rejected.

Due to MEL requirement, fuel load was increased by 5000 LBS which put us over the ATOW but still below the runway limit for 22k [thrust setting] flaps 1. During taxi, requested new performance data via ACARS. The data did NOT uplink to the FMC, and had to be manually input. New data was for a 24k flaps 5 takeoff.  However, flaps were still left at the previous setting of flaps 1. The takeoff was normal with a slow rotation and normal climb out.  At 1000 FT pilot flying called for flaps 1, and that is when I noticed that the flaps were already at flaps 1.  Take off and flight was uneventful.				B737-800 flight crew departed with flaps 1 when flaps 5 was required by a fuel load increase.

Because we were vectored in tight behind the A320, we requested S-turns to give us some extra spacing.  We were also advised that there would be an Embraer jet departing another runway prior to our arrival.  On short final, we encountered wake turbulence from the preceding A320 and I was busy stabilizing the aircraft while, at the same time, paying attention to our separation from the departing Embraer jet.  As my comfort level with regard to spacing from the departing Embraer jet was beginning to diminish, I began to prepare myself for a go-around.  Shortly thereafter, it became apparent to me that the Embraer jet would be airborne and beyond the intersection of our runway and his prior to us touching down.  I then decided to continue the approach and land the aircraft.  After arriving at the gate, I questioned my First Officer if he remembered receiving a landing clearance because I did not remember receiving one.  He did not remember receiving a landing clearance either.  I believe that I landed without a clearance, unintentionally, because of a number of factors.  First of all, I was task-saturated at a critical point of the flight - on short final.  Because of the tight spacing behind the A320, the wake turbulence encounter and the need for ensuring adequate separation from the departing Embraer jet, I was distracted and failed to remember to obtain a landing clearance (at least I think I failed to obtain the landing clearance).  Although I am dissatisfied with myself and the fact that I unintentionally landed without a clearance (or at least I think I did), I do feel that safety was at the top of my priority list in that my attention was focused on stabilizing the aircraft and avoiding a potential separation conflict with the departing Embraer jet.				An A320 Captain reported possibly landing without a clearance after he was distracted by a wake vortex encounter and concern with the tight spacing on the preceding aircraft.

We then received ECAM for A/P and A/thr.  We then noticed the engines had rolled back to idle.  The Captain (PF) then backed the throttles out of climb detent to regain control.  We also noticed that we lost both Flight Directors and FMA's.  Initiated a call to Dispatch to help establish contact with Maintenance.  As we were talking to Maintenance (About 10 minutes later) we noticed that the Flight Directors reappeared on both of our PFD's.  We then attempted to engage the autopilot and autothrottle.  This worked for less then a minute then we received the L/G shock absorber ECAM again followed by the A/P and A/thr disconnect ECAM's.  At this point we decided we would not use the Auto Flight systems for the remainder of the flight.  Since there is nothing in the Flight Manual about this situation we consulted Maintenance for any other information we would need to know to conduct a safe approach and landing.  They informed us that to be alert for an ECAM for the N/W which we had already noted in the flight manual.  In coordination with Dispatch we declared an emergency and the Captain flew an uneventful ILS approach to landing.	The reporter believes that a sensor failure caused the reported anomalies although no definitive cause was reported by Maintenance.  He also states that Autothrust did not reduce thrust during the second failure, indicating Thrust Lock and maintaining the current thrust setting.  He believes that the first instance was the same except that Autothrust had just made a large thrust reduction at the moment of failure, giving the appearance of a failure caused thrust rollback.	Uneventful until about 2 hrs into flight... Received Anti Ice Stby Pitot ECAM. Worked to clear and ECAMS complete, screens normal. About 4 hrs into flight... At FL370 received L/G Shock Absorber Fault, AP and ATHR kicked off, throttles went to idle thrust. Immediately followed by Auto FLT AP OFF, Auto FLT A/Thr off ECAM. Lost all FMA's and both F/D. Attempted to restore Autoflight, but would not engage. Discussion with Dispatch and Maintenance were inconclusive about actual system fault determination. Upon reviewing FM, further notes, warnings and cautions revealed possible nosewheel offset upon landing. Dispatch was coming to same consideration upon review of FM, and had already notified Tower to standby with equipment upon landing.  Flew manual and raw data approach to an uneventful landing.		A320 Flight Crew experiences ECAM for L/G Shock Absorber Fault at FL370, followed by Autopilot, Autothrottle, and FMA failures.

We received an RA to monitor vertical speed. The First Officer confirmed the RA and I disconnected the autopilot and followed the commands to increase the descent rate. We had a target at 12 o'clock position at +200 FT just off the nose. It seemed improbable but we followed the TCAS RA commands as trained. I told the First Officer to advise ATC that we were following the RA commands and we were not able to stop the descent at 9,000. He did so and asked for lower. ATC said they had no other traffic near us and to stop the descent at 9,000 FT. I said no we needed lower and we went through 9,000 FT. First Officer advised ATC and we were cleared to 8,000 FT. I continued down and by now we were aware that the target was not going away. It was still in the same position on our displays. I leveled at 8,000 FT and ATC stated to go no lower because of departing traffic from MIA at 7,000 FT. MIA was in a westerly operation. They again stated that they had no traffic near us. The First Officer and I agreed to select TA on the TCAS because we felt assured that this was a TCAS failure. The target stayed in the same position on our displays for the rest of the descent and approach to landing. An emergency was not declared because we were cleared to 8,000 FT and when level at 8,000 FT we had figured out that this had to be a TCAS failure. I was at the 9,000 FT crossing just about to take the communication and declare an emergency but we were cleared to lower. The aircraft had the lower TCAS antenna replaced by maintenance. Also First Officer stayed one second in front of me and kept up an open communication with ATC. If I thought of it he seems to have been on the way to doing it.				B737 Captain experienced a TCAS RA during descent into MIA and took evasive action. Relative position of intruder aircraft did not change while ATC advised is no traffic in the area, leading the crew to assume a TCAS anomaly.

As I was the pilot not flying, I called back to Operations. I was advised that there was an omission of 759 LBS of cargo from the loading schedule that we had received. The cargo had been loaded in the forward bin. I was then given a corrected zero fuel weight and takeoff weight. I advised the First Office of the error. We discussed any adverse ramifications. Due to the light load onboard, we determined that the additional weight would not affect any flight planned characteristics (climb, cruise, etc.). The correct weights were entered into the FMC and the performance computer. We continued the flight without any further complications. I had noticed in the past few days that there were numerous delays reported on Dispatch Releases attributed to incorrect or late bin slips from the Ramp. I had discussed these with the Agents in those cities. It was explained to me that there was a change in procedures and it was causing delays. Apparently these errors were caught early in the process. We were fortunate that the error was small. Nevertheless, in the future, I can only relate my experience with Coworkers to help ensure this does not happen again.				A B737 crew was notified after takeoff about 759 LBS of cargo loaded in the aircraft's forward bin but not included on the weight and balance. The weight and balance was corrected and the flight continued normally to its destination.

We immediately leveled off at FL210 and Captain ran the Cockpit Windshield Cracked checklist in the abnormal procedures section of the QRH while First Officer slowed to 250 KTS to lessen impact on windshield. Captain addressed the associated ECAM action. I believe it was 'Captain windshield heat inoperative.' Pressurization and all other cockpit indications were normal. Captain determined that we were to descend immediately to 10,000 return to departure airport due to the fact that FL230 was the maximum altitude and we didn't have the fuel to make it to our destination, First Officer agreed. First Officer was pilot flying and arranged to return to our departure airport with ATC with the possibility of needing to burn off fuel to land below max landing weight limit based on Captain's and Dispatcher's determination. Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and determined that landing overweight was the best course of action.  First Officer agreed. Captain ran the overweight landing checklist while ATC informed us they would be rolling CFR. We agreed with ATC and gave them souls and fuel on board. Captain contacted the Flight Attendants and made a PA to the passengers.  Airport Operations sent an in-range ACARS with return gate information. Captain then became the pilot flying. First Officer re-ran the cracked windshield, overweight landing checklist, ECAM action/status, and all normal checklists. Captain landed with at approximately 158,000 LBS less than 100 FT per/min. After landing, we stopped the aircraft so that CFR could inspect brakes. All cockpit indications were normal. We proceeded to the gate with one CFR escort.				A320 Captain's windshield shattered passing FL200, the crew leveled off at FL210. First Officer reports that after consultation with the Company the crew elected to return to departure airport for an overweight landing.

All the checklists were performed and we landed with no event.  The fire trucks inspected the engine and saw no issues with us taxiing back to the gate.  Maintenance met the aircraft and it was taken out of service.  We spoke with the Chief Pilot on Duty and determined that we were fit to fly to our destination for one leg.		We previously had an aborted takeoff for a Master Caution, number one Engine Control light. We returned to the gate and had Maintenance meet us. Maintenance signed off the jet to fly. It was a normal takeoff until reaching 4000 FT MSL. The compressor stalls were on the number one engine. We reduced power, which stopped the compressor stalls. There were no secondary indications for the rest of the flight. We declared an emergency and returned to land. It was a normal landing and there was no damage noted by the fire trucks.

The writeup was for the Stab Trim out of Trim light the previous night. We departed forty-four minutes late with the logbook sign-off indicating the problem was fixed. Approximately one hour from [destination] at FL400, the Stab Trim out of Trim light illuminated.The QRH was called for and run as follows: Control Column---------Hold Firmly Autopilot--------------Disengage Stabilizer Trim---------As Required We are instructed that if the stabilizer fails to respond to the electric trim inputs, accomplish the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative Checklist, which is basically declaring an emergency, and perform a flaps 15 landing. Before that was going to take place, I wanted to check the Circuit Breaker for Stab Trim. It was popped and was reset. The electric trim was back and working. At this time with the electric trim working, the Stabilizer out of Trim Checklist was complete. The cockpit duties were starting to get very busy with starting a descent, ATIS, gate, Approach Control and hand-flying. The First Officer did an outstanding job with all duties while I was hand-flying the descent. I decided to try the autopilot again and it worked for about one minute. Then we ended up with the same situation as before with the Stab Trim Out of Trim light. The autopilot was off (no trim) so I asked the First Officer if he was comfortable with resetting the circuit breakers again and continuing on. I felt that the  autopilot was the cause for the stab trim problem and if I could get the electric trim back and hand-fly the aircraft there was no need the declare an emergency and do a flaps 15 landing.I exercised Captain's emergency authority and had the circuit breaker reset for a second time. The electric trim was regained and aircraft was hand-flown with all step-down altitudes on the STAR complied with. There were no problems with trim and a normal flaps 30 landing was accomplished. The writeup in the logbook was accomplished. I probably gave too much detail to the event, but I wanted Maintenance to know what was done to help them with their continuing stab trim problem.				A B737-700 flight crew reported a problem with the stabilizer trim when the autopilot was engaged. They disengaged the autopilot and hand flew the arrival and landing with no difficulties.

Ceilings at 3,500 AGL with good visibility.Moderate to severe turbulence started around 3,000 MSL about 20 miles out on final to Runway 22. When we contacted Tower for landing clearance he advised 'previous aircraft reported plus and minus 30 KTS on final, windshear reports at 1,000 FT, several aircraft have gone around, you are cleared to land Runway 22'. Had I been aware that these conditions had been in effect for hours and were forecast for hours more I would never have departed. Dispatch never said a word.Our alternate had similar conditions. We discussed windshear preventive measures and a flaps 3 approach and landing was flown. Airspeed was all over the place. We experienced a loss of 40 KTS at one time but the aircraft recovered back to mini GS. Most of the final approach was plus or minus 30 but never less then 150 KIAS. At 1,000 FT we did get the 'windshear' warning four times but it stopped and again IAS never got below 150. the turbulence was mod [with] a few severe jolts. We also had the 20 KTS gain below 1,000 FT. Just prior to touchdown tower reported winds at 26038G47. We touched down about 1,500 FT down the runway and slowed very quickly in about 3,000 FT to taxi speed.Needless to say this was an unexpected end to an unplanned reassignment with no fore-warning. Until the Tower issued our clearance we had no idea these were the conditions at our destination. We had several high probability and a few medium probability windshear indications and yet ATC Controllers were allowing flights to land and takeoff. We do not train for planned windshear approaches and landings. However, at no time did we allow our airspeed to reach an unsafe state nor did we feel the aircraft was in any dangerous or unrecoverable position. This is one of those real world events that we had never encountered. It seems that Dispatch needs to notify crews in advance of current field conditions like these and that perhaps we need to train our pilots for extreme wind events like these.		Did normal descent planning and briefed for a LOC (Managed/Selected) approach. Did not brief wind shear due to ATIS not reporting it. Airport landing Runway 22 due to winds reported at approximately 240/34G47. Vectored by Approach for a LOC to Runway 22 due to a ragged ceiling. Winds on the descent were 15 to 20 KTS. Configured as per brief and used Flaps 3. Configured for the approach about 1.5 miles prior to the FAF. Tower reported that airplanes prior were reporting +25 to -5 KTS on final. Winds became stronger the lower the descent, but the steady state winds and gusts stayed fairly constant. Airplanes were landing at an interval to accommodate takeoffs and landings for single runway operation. Airplanes before us were not reporting any wind shear, but were reporting airspeed gains and some losses after landing.The approach became a visual below the ragged ceiling and before the FAF. Captain was descending on the PAPI and localizer course. The VVI fluctuated between 700 and 800 FPM down as we were using a briefed 3 degree glideslope. The airspeed was fluctuating with the mini GS, but not more than -5 to +10 KTS. A quick 5 KT drop in airspeed coupled with a momentary increase in VVI set off the FAC windshear warning. The warning came as a surprise because the airplane was fairly steady given the winds and no wind shear had been reported by the prior landing airplane.Long discussion on the ground about the weather conditions and how the weather was affecting the approach, especially that the weather was strong enough to cause a single runway operation. The weather and runway configuration situation were not given the significance that it deserved in the flight papers. I was wrongly under the impression that the weather had moved on and we were delayed because of the volume of traffic, not by single runways operations and continuing winds.The FOM states that in every case it is the responsibility of the pilot flying to assess the situation and use sound judgment in determining the safest course of action. The safest course of action seemed to be, in this situation, to continue the approach and land.		Surprised to learn there was significant windshear at their destination, an A320 Flight Crew chose to land regardless because their alternate was no better.

He asked 'Have you flown out here before?' I stated I had. He then very sarcastically replied 'Well then you have been kept on a heading this long before.' My response was an exaggerated, 'Well excuse me!' The fact is I have been left on a heading on that departure and forgotten about numerous times. I didn't like his condescending and confrontational demeanor. I asked for a phone number to contact him. He gave me a number. I then asked for his initials twice. He kept silent. Several hours later I called the number. I spoke to a Supervisor and he explained to me that he thought he knew who it was and that training was going on. The male voice was the instructor. I am reporting this because I do not think he displayed a positive role model for his new student in training. I attempted to enhance communications. He attempted to disparage communications. It is lack of communication between pilots and ATC that lead to disaster.				A320 pilot reports being left on a heading after departing ORD up to cruise altitude.

The aircraft landed on the runway and taxied to the gate with no further incident.		After completing the required checklist items, it was clear that continuing to our destination was our best option due to our current idle on-profile descent to the final approach fix for the runway.This decision allowed us just enough time to coordinate our emergency status with ATC, notify Dispatch, communicate the plan to the flight attendants, and inform the passengers. The resulting approach, landing, and taxi in were uneventful and the passengers seemed calm and thankful.		During their initial descent for landing a B737-700 flight crew received an engine oil filter bypass warning light.

This flight was no exception. Captain agreed to a fuel load of 178,752 LBS with cargo already being offloaded as the headwinds were significant that evening with a flilght time scheduled for over thirteen hours and this particular flight being 44 minutes over scheduled block time. Typically, the burn is based on an oceanic flight level of a cruise altitude that is close OR over the maximum allowable for the aircraft based on the weight at coast out. But, typically, the problem remains: if you DON'T push the limits on requesting a higher altitude, then because of all the eastbound oceanic traffic, you get assigned a flight level in the very low thirties (FL310 or FL320). This possibility and reality on many flights, obviously burns gas at a level that is significantly higher than what is planned on the flightplan, but also, puts you into the domestic destination with an uncomfortably low fuel on board (FOB). The other alternative in this situation is to simply divert to an alternate, but obviously that isn't in the Company's best interest. History revels that when we first took delivery of the Airbus' the flight planning program showed the aircraft starting a descent VERY late in the flightplan, NOT AT ALL reflective of the correct altitudes assigned by ATC with airspace restrictions. This was reportedly 'fixed' a little over a year ago. Well, apparently someone in Dispatch changed our flightplan, on this particular flight to reflect FL400 at an initial SID point and FL220 at the next significant point. The typical altitudes assigned by ATC are FL200 and 14,000 respectively for the same two fixes. Somehow these got changed to REFLECT a lower burn overall and a higher FOB arrival into the domestic destination. For the last two hours of the flight, the Dispatcher was insisting that data transmitted to Dispatch from the aircraft was showing a landing with approximately 14K, when the FMC was showing (until the last 1,000 FT) a landing with around 12K. Remarkably, the FMC updated itself in the last 1,000 FT and showed a landing with about 14K. So, as I see it we have three problems here: 1) Being pressured to accept a fuel load at our foreign departure airport that unless a flight level for the oceanic crossing is FL390 or FL400, a divert is certain if you get stuck at an altitude in the low flight levels. 2) The flight plan (at least in this case) were altered to show an unrealistic top of descent point (TOD) that, of course, shows a lower overall burn and is NOT reflective of realistic altitudes assigned by ATC for the restrictive airspace on the east coast. Lastly, 3) apparently the data uploaded to Dispatch's computers does NOT agree with the information displayed to the crew on the FMC. I have no explanation for this phenomena. Very simple explanation: too much emphasis on taking maximum payload and not enough on uploading enough fuel that accounts and allows for most contingencies. Consider revisiting the three points that are raised in this report.	The Reporter stated that the Captain was fairly new and had not flown this long leg before and so had been reluctant to take the reporter's recommendations over the fuel given on the release. The reporter felt that accepting a destination arrival fuel of 14K was too low given the possibility of a low enroute altitude restriction and possible destination traffic delays which were typical during bank arrivals at the destination. This particular flight enters the Atlantic Oceanic Track system very early in the morning and is head on to the the early morning European Oceanic arrivals. If the aircraft is not capable of attaining an altitude of FL390 or above then they will have to remain at an altitude which is not fuel efficient. The reporter did say that at this point the Air Carrier's Chief Pilot's are not admonishing flight crews for requesting additional fuel but it appears the dispatchers are the pressure point.			An A330 pilot reported that Dispatch is pressuring pilots to accept an unreasonably low fuel departure fuel on a very long flight into headwinds, with the potential for a low Oceanic enroute altitude.

At approximately 4,000 FT MSL, the Departure Controller cleared us to 'climb to FL190, comply with restrictions.' We selected 19,000 in the altitude window and CLB for vertical navigation. After passing ROPPR (at or below 7,000 FT), I noticed that that the SHEAD 6 had a few new points, and new terminology when compared to  the SHEAD 5 departure. I asked the departure controller to clarify the new altitude restrictions, showing both 'at or above' and '(ATC)' at the next several points. (These changes in the depiction and charting terminology were new to me.) The Controller replied 'We don't really know why they changed the charts, but it appears that the new altitude restrictions are something for you?' During this discussion, the First Officer requested open climb. (This was a typical request on the SHEAD 5, before the new restrictions were added). I then asked the Controller to clarify what altitude restrictions he expected us to comply with. He confirmed that we should comply with the altitudes which were depicted as (ATC) altitudes. At this time we were approaching MDDOG passing 9,000 FT and eventually crossed MDDOG at approximately 9,500 FT (500 FT high). The remainder of the SID and flight went as published.				An A320 Captain flying the LAS SHEAD 6 RNAV Departure queried ATC about the new waypoints and ATC altitudes shown. ATC did not know the reason for them but they are the altitudes the crew was expected to comply with.

Then I saw a small white T-Tail private aircraft pass directly underneath us by about 300 FT. Then discovered he was at 4,000 FT by the Controller reprimanding him for not being at his assigned 3,500 FT. The TCAS saved our lives because we were able to climb to about 4,500 FT before CPA. Had we of just stopped at 4,000 FT we would have been on collision course.				An A320 Captain reported a 300 FT NMAC with a light aircraft on a visual approach when the other aircraft did not maintain its assigned altitude and ATC detected that aircraft's deviation until just prior to the conflict.

I was the pilot flying.  The weather was VFR, it was a visual approach, and the ride was smooth.  The alert was surprising because there was no indication that any windshear was in the area at the time.  The ride was smooth and uneventful.  Our decision was also based on the aircraft doing strange things prior to this event.  On the previous departure, when the autothrottles were engaged for takeoff they did not advance until I set the proper N1s.  Twice the aircraft leveled off 250 FT above the altitude requested in the MCP window in VNAV.  Later the autothrottles did respond on TOGA for departure and the flight director bars did not display on the PFD.  This aircraft had done strange things so when we got the windshear alert there was absolutely nothing that we felt would give the aircraft that indication.  The previous issues made us feel it was a glitch.  If the weather would have been suspect, LLWS advisories, or even windshear forwarded by the Tower or other aircraft, this would have been different.  Since it was severe clear and smooth as glass, with no visual clues of any windshear whatsoever being in the area, we did not initiate the go-around.				Windshear alert activated while a B737-700 was on a visual approach at 400 FT.  The crew ignored the alert and landed because there were no low level windshear warnings and the weather was clear and smooth.  The aircraft had previous unrelated automation problems.

We selected manual pressurization, turned on the bleed switches and closed the outflow valve to get the pressurization under control.  When the cabin pressurization returned to normal, auto was selected on the pressurization and the climb was continued without incident.  The First Officer stated during the post flight the night prior he turned off both bleed switches.   Neither of us caught it during preflight or other checklists.		On climbout thru 10,000 FT got the cabin altitude warning horn. Donned O2 masks, noticed both engine bleed switches in the off position. Turned one bleed on, switched to manual pressurization, closed the outflow valve and waited for the cabin to stablilize and descend back down below 10,000 which only took about 1 minute. Turned on the remaining bleed, and went back to auto pressurization. It occured to me that on the inbound flight I must have inadvertantly turned off the engine bleed switches. It was a long duty day with almost 8 hours of flying. On the next morning, I didn't catch the switch position on the origination preflight.		A B737-800 First Officer turned the engine bleeds off after arrival the night before and forgot to open them the next morning during preflight. After climbing through 10,000 FT the CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING sounded, the bleeds were opened and pressurization restored.

Some steering was available and the runway was cleared. Tower was informed of our situation - stopping the aircraft and inability to taxi further. They also dispatched ARFF who arrived within one minute. I coordinated with the ARFF Commander while the Relief Pilot talked to Operations to coordinate a tow and the First Officer remained with Ground Control and made a preliminary PA to the passengers and ran checklists. The ARFF commander confirmed a leak of fluid around the nose gear with no other problems noted. The tug arrived within 10 minutes and after their inspection which confirmed the hydraulic leak, we were hooked to the tug and towed to the gate. No further problems were encountered.

After contacting our Dispatch and Maintenance we were told we were on our own and proceeded to our destination. We knew that we had to keep a nose up attitude above zero degrees so the lose baggage container could not move around in the aproximately 60 FT long baggage compartment. We declared an emergency and asked for the equipment to stand by as we did not know the damage to our aircraft. We were able to stop the container from moving around and after a long traffic pattern had a smooth and safe landing. We used the whole runway and stopped after clearing the runway. The Fire Department checked the airplane for obvious damage and informed us they could not see any damage from the outside. We continued to the gate and disembarked our passengers safely. After arriving at the gate it was clear that we had a loose container in the forward baggage compartment.	The Reporter stated that the crew was concerned about both the E and E compartment forward being damaged and the compartment aft where flight controls and hydraulics are located. He stated that he was disappointed that his Dispatcher did not give him more information about what was in the forward baggage hold. In the end there was no damage but he was not able to determine what component did not hold or if it was human error.			A B777 Captain reported that a baggage container came loose in flight and was heard to have impacted the aft wall of the foreword baggage compartment.

Center said that someone at company declared the emergency for us.The Captain made a PA explaining what our situation was and how it would be a normal landing. The landing and taxi in was uneventful except we were met by the CFR. We tried to have the Tower and the CFR cancel the emergency, but nobody would. The Captain talked to the CFR and they left.As a pilot, I really thought it was ridiculous how after telling Dispatch we were not declaring an emergency, someone on the ground could do that for us. This totally blindsides the crew while they are flying. My flight's events highlight the fact that only the crew flying the aircraft should be able to declare an emergency. We advised Dispatch clearly that we were fine and not declaring an emergency, but our informed and educated PROFESSIONAL opinion and decision was disregarded by someone sitting on the ground who is not the A320 expert. This policy is not smart. It needs to be changed.		After switching to Center, was asked for our fuel on board and souls on board. I asked who prompted that, they said the company. I told them that we were NOT an emergency aircraft.		Following the loss of the left engine driven hydraulic pump during climb out, the flight crew of an A320 was distressed to learn that an emergency had been declared for them upon arrival at their destination.

We immediately declared an emergency and made a left turn with a rapid descent toward a nearby airport. We completed the Cargo Fire Checklist and the fire warning light went out. We called the Flight Attendants and asked them if they noticed anything unusual. They reported they did not. We the ran the emergency landing checklist and the before landing checklist. The Captain made a PA to the passengers and completed the TEST items to the Flight Attendants informing them we would be landing in ten minutes. The weather was VFR with light winds and we requested a straight in visual to the runway. Just before an overweight landing at 146,000 LBS the AFT CARGO FIRE warning light came back on. We came to stop on the runway and the Fire Chief came up on our radio frequency. We directed him to our aft cargo door to give us a temperature reading. He did not detect any heat so we made the decision not to evacuate. Mobile lounges were immediately brought up to the aircraft and all the passengers and Flight Attendants were quickly deplaned. All the luggage was removed from the aft cargo compartment and we were told two suspect bags had elevated temperatures. We were later informed a flashlight had started a fire in a suitcase. After all clear by the Fire Chief we were towed to a hardstand by Company personnel.				A flashlight battery overheated in luggage located in a B737-800's aft cargo compartment and caused the AFT CARGO FIRE warning to alert.

ATC assigned us 17R which was a change from the expected runway, so we loaded the ILS to 17R in LNAV and changed to the 17R ILS frequencies. ATC called traffic to us at 11:00 clock (we were on an angling right base). Looked but couldn't see it. ATC asked if we could see the airport (we could) and issued a visual approach clearance. ATC instructed us to keep our speed up to the final approach fix. Autopilot was on and connected to LNAV. We kept looking to the left for the traffic and when I looked to the right I saw the left and right runway and disconnected the autopilot to turn final. As I turned final, we both noticed that we were right of the LNAV track. We checked the ILS raw data and it also showed us right of course. We checked for proper LNAV points, ILS frequencies and identifiers which were all correct. Next we asked the Tower to verify the ILS was operating and were told it checked OK. Tower also verified the ILS frequency and assigned runway.Now we are about 3 miles from landing and my eyes were telling me to land on the right runway while my instruments are telling me to land on the left. This doesn't make sense and I do a go-around to give us time to discover the problem. As we go around, I look out the left window and see the passenger terminal. This is not where it should be and after cleaning up and doing checklists, I look at the airport diagram again and it dawns on me that I have lined up on the 18R/L side of the airport which explains the conflicting information. On downwind, we reload the LNAV and re-verify everything. On approach, we carefully follow the instruments to final and make an uneventful landing in 17R.This event occurred primarily because I followed my visual input first and didn't rely on my navigation aids enough. Other factors included: The airport is brightly lit on both sides of the 18 complex which made me think the terminal was to my right. It is fairly dark to the east of the 17s. The runway lights are difficult to see until almost lined up on final. This was obvious on our second approach as we crossed the 18 centerlines but still couldn't see the 17s. The traffic call and the requirement to keep our speed up added distraction. End of the day fatigue and VMC weather lead to less vigilance.As years of training have taught me, always use the instruments to verify where the aircraft is. While this saved me from landing on the wrong runway, I could have used it much more effectively (and sooner) to avoid lining up on the wrong runway. At airports where there are runways separated by large areas, I will review how many runways will be crossed prior to turning final. This is especially important on VMC arrivals with visual approaches.				Following a late runway change at DFW the flight crew of a B737-700 lined up visually with the wrong runway. The discrepancy between their visual picture and the ILS/NAV displays alerted them to make a go around and reorient themselves.

Following the QRH we closed the isolation valve switch, turned off the left pack switch, the number one bleed switch, and verified the wing anti-ice switch was off.  At that point the wing body overheat extinguished.  We communicated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control.  Because of existing icing conditions at destination we were unable to continue.  We coordinated a diversion plan to ZZZ where the weather was VFR and planned to land with 11,000 LBS of fuel.  A little over 200 NM away from ZZZ ATC cleared from FL410 to FL340.  Passing FL390 the Right Bleed Trip Off light illuminated.  I quickly glanced at the QRH as I already had it out from the previous checklist and pushed the trip reset button.  We both noticed the cabin starting to rise through 9,000 FT so we donned our oxygen mask and initially had trouble establishing communications because we both forgot we had to push a switch to talk.  When it clicked that we had to press the intercom switch we established communications.  I don't know how long it took but it seemed like a while.  During the time of trying to establish communications the Captain started the emergency descent and I declared a depressurization emergency descending to 10,000 FT.  I then looked up to put the start switches to FLT and continued on with the Bleed Trip Off Checklist with the bleed not able to reset.  I then looked to see if we were in a good emergency descent condition verifying that all the steps had been accomplished.  The Captain was flying a great emergency descent.I began to review the Cabin Altitude Warning or Rapid Depressurization Checklist as the cabin altitude passed 14,000 FT.  Before accomplishing the full procedure, I quickly cycled the bleed switch off then on and pressed the trip reset button once again.  The Bleed Trip light went out and I selected the pack back to auto.  At that point the pack started to stabilize the cabin.  The cabin reached 15,000 FT at its highest point when it started to reverse its' direction.  The cabin altitude descended below 10,000 FT before the aircraft reached 10,000 FT.  When the pressurization was stabilizing I reviewed and completed the Emergency Descent Checklist.  The cabin pressurization and temperature both looked normal.  The Captain notified the flight attendants and the passengers of the situation.  The flight attendants confirmed the oxygen masks were indeed down as indicated.  We evaluated our fuel load and notified Dispatch.  We then informed ATC we would continue to ZZZ for a visual landing and we had recovered pressurization of the aircraft.I think the emergency descent should be a memory item once again.  We very much need hot mics in all the aircraft.  Our initial confusion about the final step of pushing the toggle switch to talk took up valuable time.  That is one of the first times I have ever pushed that switch.  I also had to push it while running checklists and moving switches.  This is a great example of why lack of hot mics is a safety of flight issue.		We had a Wing Body Overheat on the left side.  The QRH had us shut the left bleed off and required us to change our destination due to an Airmet for ice at destination.  When given a step-down altitude from FL390 to FL340, the right bleed trip off light illuminated.  We asked for lower while continuing our descent to FL340 and ATC said unable.  We started to lose cabin pressurization.  We donned our oxygen masks attempted crew communication.  We declared an emergency and said we were going to 10,000 FT.  I was the pilot flying and the First Officer was running the QRH Checklists.  We regained control of the right bleed through about FL180.  Once the cabin altitude was below 10,000 FT we pulled our oxygen masks off and made sure we communicated with the flight attendants, passengers, ATC, Dispatch, and each other.  We continued on and landed safely. Upon reaching the gate the amount of personnel and the questions being asked made it a little harder to make sure everything that needed to be done got done.  I wrote up a couple write ups on the airplane but I later called Maintenance because I felt I had overlooked a writeup.  I went back towards the aircraft and called Maintenance Control about this to see if they wanted me to add it.  They informed me they would take care of any additional write ups.  We were pulled from flight duty and deadheaded back to base.  After evaluating that decision I think it was the correct action by Management because we would have been thinking about this flight while flying the next one.		B737-700 flight crew experiences a left Wing Body Overheat at FL410 and complies with QRH procedures, including diversion due to forecast icing at destination.  During descent passing FL390 The right wing body overheat illuminates, necessitating an emergency descent.

We were given a heading of 90 degrees, which was into the center of a cell. I stated 'unable', due to weather and that we would need 100 degrees for a heading. The controller then stated that 'I know it is your job to fly the airplane', and that 'airplanes have been coming through there all night and I have 500 airplanes in the area.'  He then said he needed a heading of 090 and asked what I needed, I said, '100', and he then said, 'turn right 150', and from there he vectored us out to a position 40 miles West of EWR while he sequenced a series of what he called, 'slow movers', in front of us. We were sequenced in for approach about 30 minutes later while pounding through rain showers at 5000 feet the whole time. We thought he would re sequence us within a few minutes, but after 20 minutes we realized that we must have been given a low priority. During this time he sent a Air Carrier X and a Air Carrier Y out of the pattern for the same reason. When Air Carrier Y asked how long it would be, he said, 'about 10 minutes', Air Carrier Y replied that he was tight on fuel, and NY TRACON replied that he really 'Didn't have time to give him the attention he needed right now. ' Frankly, I was surprised at the attitude of the controller about cells we were painting. I was also surprised to be placed in a 'holding area' with no idea of an EFC, while other aircraft appeared to be continuing the approach. If aircraft are to be placed in a holding area because they can't take a vector through active weather, they should be given some idea of the amount of time they will be there, for planning purposes.				Air Carrier Captain expressed concern regarding the ATC handling provided by N90 noting the controller's attitude and absence of an EFC when weather deviations were necessary and requested.

Maintenance asked during flight pre-brief if we would accept aircraft with deferred window heat inoperative.  After discussions over weather and MEL stating that must remain out of any forecast icing it was apparent that we could not.  We therefore declined the aircraft with the concurrence of both Maintenance and Dispatch.  Diagnosis and repair took approximately 2 hours and we departed without incident nearly one hour past the original departure time.  The flight takeoff and departure were normal until approximately 8,000 FT when we got a Master Caution and Status message Window Heat Right.  I was the flying pilot I continued to fly the airplane and assisted with the radios while the Captain and other co-pilot handled the problem.  The decision to return to the departure was made because weather on the departure as throughout the flight had significant areas of icing.  Additionally the decision to land over weight was made.  With weather all around the airport staying out of icing would be impossible.  Landing weight was below performance (go-around) but above structural landing limits.  An emergency was declared because of the possibility of hot brakes after landing.  Dispatch and Operations were contacted prior to landing.  Window Heat Inoperative as well Overweight Checklists were accomplished.  The arrival and approach were uneventful and landing was made with no unusual force.  Aircraft came to an easy stop with nearly 3,000 FT remaining.  Emergency responders saw no issue with aircraft tires or brakes.  Taxied normally into the cargo area and had the aircraft chalked.				The B777 arrived with the right windshield heat inoperative but it could not be MEL'ed because of icing so it was repaired prior to departure.  However, it failed again after takeoff so an emergency was declared for the return to the departure airport.

During climb out the left wing body overheat light illuminated. I continued to fly while the Captain went through the QRH procedures. Once we shut down the left pack, the light extinguished and the decision was made to return. Our return was delayed due to a thunderstorm that had moved over the field. Once the weather improved we landed. We did not declare an emergency because the overheat extinguished, we had no other abnormal indications from the cabin or cockpit, and the landing was not overweight.

We then received at least two more clearance changes from at least two voices on the radio. Then we received the following: ' Air Carrier X, say reason for go around'. My focus narrowed as I formulated a response as I had not had time to talk to the First Officer about what happened and what she saw on final.Somewhere in all that we ended up on heading 240 degrees and were directed back to a 200 degree heading. I don't know for sure whether or not we were given a clearance to 240 but I thought we were at the time. I've had this Tower request this in the middle of a go around before (and I've reported it before). The go around is the most challenging maneuver we do. And I know what meteorological events require me to report such to ATC.If the go around has a successful outcome, why am I asked this by the Tower? If you are going to ask me, why ask while I am climbing and turning at low altitude? Since I am task saturated during the go around, my standard answer from now on will be 'complying with company procedures.' That way I will not be distracted by the tower at a critical phase of flight.				A B737-800 Captain took exception to the Local Controller's request that he explain the reason for his go-around while the reconfiguration of the aircraft and compliance with ATC revised MAP due to the go-around were still in progress.

I called for the After Takeoff Checklist and the PACK light checklist and the First Officer completed both [from] the QRC. The PACK light did not extinguish after completing the steps in the QRC. We were unable to notify Line Maintenance due to radio problems.We confirmed the aircraft was pressurizing and continued our climb out. We were eventually able to contact Maintenance Control through Dispatch and Line Maintenance. We confirmed with both that there were no altitude restrictions associated with single pack operations and we continued our climb to FL350, monitoring cabin pressurization as we climbed.A short time later we got the Cabin Altitude Warning Horn. We donned our oxygen masks and established communications. The Pilot Monitoring completed the QRC Cabin Altitude Warning checklist and the continuation of that checklist out of the QRH. The cabin altitude was not stabilizing with the outflow valve switch closed. Simultaneously we coordinated a descent with ATC and declared an emergency and indicated our intentions to return to our departure airport. The cabin altitude got to approximately 12,000 FT before it stabilized as we descended. I notified the cabin crew of our problem and intentions to return. As we continued our descent we coordinated our return with Dispatch, informed them of our problem and that we had declared an emergency with ATC. We also advised the passenger oxygen masks had not deployed because the cabin altitude had not gotten above 12,000 FT.We leveled off at 14,000 FT and the cabin altitude stabilized at approximately 8,000 FT. We removed our oxygen masks once the cabin stabilized below 10,000 FT. I briefed the flight attendants and informed the passengers of our emergency and plan to return. We confirmed with Dispatch that we had plenty of fuel to return and, with no other anomalies, landed normally. We taxied into the gate where we were met by Maintenance Personnel.I was later informed by Maintenance control that the Right PACK duct work had blown out causing the aircraft to lose pressurization. One of the biggest problems we had was initially contacting Maintenance Control because of radio frequency problems [perhaps due to joint use by Operations and de-ice crews]. I suggest that while de-icing procedures are in effect that the de-icing crews use a different frequency than Operations and Maintenance. I also suggest that some type of back up radio be available when the station is experiencing radio difficulties.				A B737-900 returned to the departure airport when the pressurization system failed.

On descent we noticed #2 Eng Thrust Lever Disagree ECAM message flickering on and off. We also noticed the #2 engine N1 indication fluctuate from 30-51% N1. We initially thought this was associated with the Auto Thrust inoperative MEL item.  As we approached 10000ft MSL the N1 stayed about 32% and N2 about 65%. As the F/O brought thrust levers up on both engines we noticed some aircraft yaw. Engine #1 was operating normally. We moved the #2 thrust lever from idle to full climb power with no response on the engine indications and no thrust or yawing of the aircraft as we moved the #2 thrust lever. The engine seemed to have failed and was wind milling. Oil pressure was normal, yet we had NO control of the engine with the thrust lever, there were no other ECAM indications. There were no vibrations or fire or overheat indications. To avoid thrust lever problems, and since it appeared we had lost all thrust and throttle control of the #2 engine, I ran the engine #2 failure checklist in the QRH. This was about 2000ft AGL. We  completed the Engine Failure and Landing checklists and landed without incident. We taxied to the gate and completed our after landing and shutdown checklists and called Maintenance to report the malfunction. There was little time (last 3-4 min of flight) to do much coordination as this happened shortly before landing.	Reporter states that Maintenance discovered that the cannon plug providing electrical signals to the FADEC (J9) was severely corroded and needed to be replaced.  It was also deemed likely that this plug was the source of the auto thrust anomalies.  The reporter believed at the time that the engine had failed but understands now that it was at idle with no cockpit control of thrust.	My primary concern while the Captain was consulting the checklists was to not become distracted at such as close distance to the airport and a critical phase of the flight and to safely land the aircraft. The flight landed without further incident and we taxiied to the gate and notified maintenance control of the incident.		After being dispatched with autothrust deferred, an A320 crew discovered during descent that the number two engine was not responding to thrust lever movement.  Crew continued and landed without further incident.

After takeoff, we noticed that we had forgotten to select the engine bleeds off. I believe two items contributed to our omitting to select the engine bleeds off as we had briefed.  1. As BOS was using Runway 27 for takeoff, I elected to do a single engine taxi to conserve fuel. Taxiing from our gate to Runway 27 involved crossing 3 runways and a taxi route that I was not very familiar with. While we remained focused on the taxi route and coordinating clearance to cross the 3 runways enroute to Runway 27, we also became distracted from our bleeds off SOP set up. As an additional distraction, the First Officer was also tasked with starting the number 2 engine while backing me up with the taxi route.  2. I also believe that fatigue was a contributing factor in our SOP omission. This was day three of a trip with a wake pattern of early, early, and earliest. Day one involved a XD:00 domicile time wake up. Day two was XD:15 and day three was a XA:45 domicile time wake up. While I felt fit to fly, I also felt tired from the very early wake up on day three. I will try to be more careful and deliberate with SOP compliance and give more consideration to minimizing distractions, especially when fatigued in the future.				An A320 Captain reported that the crew failed to select the engine bleeds off for a BLEEDS OFF takeoff because the First Officer was starting an engine, they were dealing with complex BOS taxi requirements, and experiencing fatigue.

Normal climbout through FL210.  Through approximately FL220 felt yaw as if someone had tapped on a rudder pedal.  After second such yaw, Captain identified engine fluctuations and disconnected autothrottle.  Simultaneously I disconnected autopilot and maintained aircraft control, which involved leveling off and adding rudder.  Number 1 engine indications showed N1 fluctuating a large amount.  Captain had me confirm that number 1 engine was the one fluctuating and that he was holding the number 1 thrust lever.  I confirmed and he attempted to regain control of the engine by retarding the thrust lever.  Soon thereafter we declared an emergency with Center and told them that we would need to level off.  We continued discussing the number 1 engine indications and what might be happening.  We decided to return to the departure airport and asked ATC for a turn direct and a lower altitude.  ATC immediately gave us a right turn direct the airport and a decent to FL200.  I took ATC communication shortly thereafter so Captain could run checklists, contact company, etc.  We agreed that engine surge/limit/stall was the appropriate checklist.  Engine responded more or less normally after our turn and descending below FL200 on the way back to the departure airport.  Captain ran QRH but we decided that there was no reason to shut number 1 engine down since we had control of it at this point.  ATC vectored us on an extended downwind for the runway.  Captain contacted Operations/Maintenance/Dispatch/flight attendants while I told ATC we would need a bit of time to get caught up with all of that.  When he was done he took control of the aircraft so I could brief the approach.  When this was complete we flew a normal 2-engine ILS to the runway.  Other than adding a few knots to target speed for gusts, the approach, landing, and rollout was completely normal.  The yaw 'pulse' was my first indication that we had engine problems.  The yaw did not seem large so I initially thought that the Captain might have tapped the rudder pedal by accident when he was moving his seat.  The second yaw pulse dispelled that notion, and right after that, the Captain asked out loud if we were having an engine failure.  After that I first went to my PFD to ensure that I was 'flying the aircraft' within parameters and after that was accomplished I saw the fluctuations on the engine instruments.  No idea what the cause was at this point and why the engine behaved the way it did.		The surge caused N1/N2 fluctuations on the number 1 engine between 40% and well over 105%.  The auto throttles were disconnected, and the number 1 thrust lever was brought back to regain control of said engine.  An emergency was declared and a new clearance direct to our departure airport was obtained.  The QRH for engine stall surge was completed through step number 6.  (Note, bringing the number 1 thrust lever back did not appear to correct the condition) this led us to believe 1 of 2 things:  1. Loss of engine control, or 2 engine stall surge.  Aircraft was under control with no other abnormal indications and N1 being kept under 55% for the remainder of the flight.		A B737-800's engine surged from about 40% to 105% during climb at FL210 IMC with engine anti-ice on.  An emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport with the engine at idle.

This immediately caught our attention as it was a clear night and the terrain ahead (rising to 4,080 FT) was clearly visible.  LAS Approach usually clears you for the approach later on the arrival and advises you to to turn final prior to the Stratosphere (about 3.5 mile final or so thus avoiding the terrain to the northeast).  Being cleared the approach from where we were put the terrain directly between us and a five mile final.We decided to maintain 5,000 FT until passing over the terrain, as we started the descent out of 5,000 FT though, we got GPWS terrain warning.  Since we were south of the crest of the terrain we thought we'd avoid the GPWS advisory, but once we started the descent, we got the advisory.  We immediately began a shallow climb and the GPWS ceased.  We continued to an uneventful landing.  Although we were aware of the terrain, our descent was initiated too early resulting in the GPWS advisory and momentary warning.  We could have avoided any potential conflict by continuing initially toward the final further south and turning final at an appropriate altitude and distance from the runway.	The reporter clarified the time of the event as being local time rather than UTC as originally provided.  He confirmed that the visual approach clearance included no provisos or restrictions.			An A320 inbound to LAS was cleared for a visual approach to Runway 19L from the vicinity of GRNPA intersection.  As they began their descent from 5,000 MSL they received an EGPWS warning.

ATC queried our altitude to which I replied 13,000 FT. She said that she showed 12,000 FT and gave the altimeter setting of 29.31. We corrected immediately. It appears there was no traffic conflict. We had moderate turbulence which made it difficult to see the ACARS weather sheet.  Strictly an attention to detail matter. It's not often you see 29.31 so my brain automatically converted [it] to 30.31. In the future I will physically touch the ACARS weather report altimeter settings to confirm.				A B737-700 flight crew set their altimeters at 30.31 instead of the actual QNH which was 29.31.

Flight Attendant called with write ups and to report a child with a severe nose bleed. Holding at FL200 we were cleared to 17,000. Around the same time we were cleared out of the hold, just north of RADDY right turn direct RADDY then via remainder of the CHINNS 6, MAINTAIN 12,000 but slow to 250 KTS. In a right descending turn as we approached 15,000 and just prior to RADDY, ATC called to confirm our altitude. He then re-cleared us to descend to and maintain 12,000. Then he let us know that he had wanted us to comply with the restrictions. The flight was completed without further events.		...we were cleared down to 17,000 FT. About that time on the outbound leg of the hold ATC cleared us to SEA via right turn direct RADDY then via the remainder of the CHINS 6 arrival, maintain 12,000 except maintain 250 KTS. If the Controller issued a clearance to comply with the altitude restrictions of the CHINS 6, both the First Officer and I missed it.Work load was high. We were: 1. Coordinating the hold and fuel status for a potential divert to PDX with Dispatch as we didn't have sufficient fuel to make our EFC time.  2. Keeping abreast of rapidly changing weather and runway conditions (closures for grooming and braking action) in SEA for the snow and low visibility--multiple ATIS's issued during this period.  3. The potential for a passenger medical emergency.  4. Other routine arrival procedures. All of this led to both of us mis-interpreting the clearance.		Confronted with very high workloads, bad weather, holding patterns and a passenger with a problem, the flight crew of a B737-800 did not realize their clearance out of the holding pattern and resume the STAR included the admonition to comply with the charted crossing restrictions.

Initially ATC slowed us from 250 KIAS to 190, then immediately to 170 and 160, and finally to 150 KIAS. We were then cleared for the ILS 16L and told to maintain 150 KIAS until DGLAS. We immediately complied with all speed reductions and captured the localizer and glide slope prior to DGLAS. On initial contact with the Tower, we were cleared to land on 16L. We had just completed the Before Landing Checklist, were on the Localizer and glide slope and had the autopilot and auto throttles engaged. At 2,100 FT approximately 1 NM north of DGLAS the Tower canceled the approach clearance and directed a go-around to maintain 2,000 FT MSL and fly the Localizer.This led to a somewhat unusual and task-intensive go-around in that it was executed prior to the assigned missed approach altitude and a level off/slight descent was required while in an auto throttle/autopilot coupled approach mode with a 750 FT ROD. The pilot flying complied using one push of the TOGA button to exit the Approach mode followed immediately by the disengagement of the auto throttles to stop the climb and level the aircraft as the pilot not flying selected missed approach and the ATC-directed altitude of 2,000 FT on the MCP. I (pilot flying) was now hand-flying the aircraft with raw data Localizer guidance only and continuing with aircraft reconfiguration and go-around, this made course control difficult and less accurate than flying with Localizer captured guidance and may have led to less than optimal course control on my behalf.As soon as we were level at 2,000 FT in a clean configuration and approximately 200 KIAS, we attempted to re-acquire localizer capture and flight director localizer guidance. We were queried by the Tower if we were maintaining the localizer and told to maintain 2,000 FT and turn right heading 195 degrees. This instruction was followed quickly by an instruction to climb and maintain 5,000 FT. We complied and were subsequently vectored for an uneventful ILS 16L. After landing we were given a phone number to contact the Tower.The ATC Supervisor informed the Captain that they were going to review the tapes. During a follow-up phone conversation, the Tower Supervisor said that a 'loss of separation' event had taken place and an investigation would follow and, at the time, no Pilot Deviation report was planned but possibly could come later. I ask what caused the loss of separation and was told it was the ATC-assigned turn to a heading of 195 degrees that was the cause and to rest assured it was not due to flight crew action.We are trained and have procedures for go-arounds and missed approaches but these do not accurately reflect or work for a go-around required prior to descending through the missed approach altitude. Level off and follow on navigation is more task-intensive, and the aircrew needs to review and have a plan for this situation. We do not train to it nor are we presented with this situation very often. In retrospect, asking for a heading to fly or better yet asking for a missed approach altitude higher than our current altitude would have made this missed approach much less task-intensive and much more compatible with standard missed approach techniques.		I was working local east. The weather was foggy but getting better with visibility of two increasing to three [miles]. I had been on position for an hour and a half.A B737 checked in to land Runway 16L but he was too close to traffic on final to 16R which was being controlled by Local West. I told the 737 to cancel approach, maintain 2,000 and fly the localizer. I then observed the aircraft drifting toward the final for Runway 16R so he was above another Air Carrier aircraft but had another one a few miles behind. I turned them to a 195 heading to get them out of the way, then switched them to departure when he was clear of traffic.		A loss of required separation with an aircraft on the parallel runway required ATC to cancel the B737-700's approach clearance as they approached the FAF for the ILS 16L at SEA clearing them to instead maintain 2,000 MSL and fly the localizer. The flight crew failed to utilize autoflight systems as required to maintain track and a conflict occurred which was corrected by a vector from the Local Controller.

[The] displaced visual cue issues described below can be very problematic in very low visibility situations.  Wrote up my aircraft yesterday, it is a new airplane.  The Flight Path Vector (FPV) in the HUD was displaced significantly to the left of the actual flight path.  If I were to put my thumb and forefinger up to the HUD, the displacement would be about an inch and a half. Continued to be displaced very much incorrectly to the left throughout the approach up to touchdown, where the FPV disappears.  The Captain that took that plane after me did not use that HUD, as I had placarded it on arrival.  Fast forward to a few minutes ago. The same Captain, on the same sequence, one day later, just landed in at the same airport with a different aircraft, again a new aircraft.  He called and said the exact same thing just in fact happened as had happened in our previous aircraft.  There is an obvious problem in the new HUDs.  This could be a very serious issue in the flare during very low visibility situations.	The Reporter stated that within his Company this HGS 4000 HUD problem has been previously reported but he personally is not aware of the frequency of erroneous Flight Path Vector (FPV) approaches. The FPV Mode uses multiple system inputs to calculate an aircraft projected path toward the selected runway that is subsequently displayed on the combiner and the outside view. A Company directive indicated that if -999' were entered in the FPV airport altitude the error would be corrected, but that procedure has not been valid in the reporter's experience although the error is significantly reduced. On a non precision approach (VOR/LOC/GPS) the horizontal flight path vector point will be over the VASI or about 200' left. The horizontal error during a precision approach is minimal. In both cases the HUD commands and the PFD flight director presentation are correct so the system is not sensing an error large enough for it to display the APCH WARN message which would be indicated when either Approach Monitoring tolerances are exceeded or AIII capability (NO AIII) is lost. The Reporter believes that this HUD should be flight tested for FPV validity and if errors are found, prohibit its use in the situations where errors are discovered. He is very concerned that a crew will not know about the possible errors and use the inaccurate HUD data to attempt, or worse, complete a landing using it.			A B737-800 Captain reported that several new aircraft equipped with the HGS 4000 HUD have a Flight Path Vector projection error which indicates the aircraft is on a path laterally displaced from the actual track to the selected runway.

Blood pressures and vital sign were taken.  His BP was 140/90 which, according to his wife, was normal for him.  His pulse, according to the physicians was weak and they requested he be placed on oxygen which he refused.  His wife informed us that he had a 40 to 50 percent blockage going to one side of his heart, that he was allergic to penicillin, and that he had nitroglycerin with him.  The Doctors on board had him take the nitro and continued recommending that he use the bottled oxygen.  A call to Medlink was made from the cockpit through our Dispatcher.  Medlink recommended that the gentleman be placed on oxygen for 30 minutes, be given an aspirin with something sweet to drink, and to continued using nitroglycerin.  Upon my request the gentleman begin using oxygen.Medlink requested that we report back with them in 30 minutes.  After complying with Medlink, the two physicians and nurse continued their monitoring of patient who at first appeared to be resting comfortably.  Approximately 15 to 20 minutes after being placed on Oxygen, the Purser notified me that the gentleman appeared to be breathing very shallowly, was sweating, and had a grayish skin color.  The on board doctors once again sprang into action and recognized the individuals condition was turning worse.  BP was dropping and no pulse could be found.  The AED was used, and cardiac massage immediately commenced.  The on board doctors were recommending an immediate divert.  Medlink was once again contacted and given the updated condition of our passenger.  Medlink was told that the AED unit was used twice and that cardiac massage was be implemented.  Medlink recommended that epinephrine be immediately started and a medical divert to landing take place.  The doctors attempted to start an IV with the medication recommended by Medlink.  It is my understanding that difficulties, because BP was low and pulse non existent, manifested themselves.  Other procedures were required and used.  I was told that our on board physicians felt that the gentleman had died, but they continued in their resuscitation attempts, each taking turns.  This procedure continued throughout our approach and landing.  As the two physicians, nurse, continued working on the gentleman our flight attendants continued working at comforting the gentleman's wife and our other passengers in the immediate area as well as the other cabin areas.I along with the other pilots as well Dispatch began working on the medical divert only 160 NMs away.  The FMS's were reprogrammed for a flight, descent,  and approach to our divert airport.  An overweight landing was going to be made.  Landing distance was determined using full flaps, and overweight landing procedures as spelled out in the QRH were followed.  Medlink, notified the airport of our medical emergency and had the paramedics and well and medical equipment standing by.  Because our landing was going to be significantly overweight, emergency fire crews were also called upon to be standing by.  The flight attendants prepared the cabin for quick approach as well as normal landing.  Medical attention continued throughout the approach and landing and up until airport medical crews arrived.  It is my understanding that the airport medical crews continued the medical resuscitation for 10 to 15 minutes and then determined or confirmed that our passenger had died.  Because the airport physician, who arrived with the Paramedics, marked our passengers death as unnatural, the airport police as well as the investigative police became involved.  Tensions within the cabin of our aircraft rose quickly.  I explained to a female investigating officer that the doctors, nurse, as well as any other that attended to the medical careof our passenger did so under the instructions of Medlink.  The medical procedures that were carried out were those that Medlink had recommended and that no one on my aircraft did anything outside the parameters of those instructions.  If fault was to be found they would have to contact Medlink.  After approximately 2 hours I was informed by the airport police officer in charge that everything was OK and our passengers were allowed to deplane.  The female investigating officer politely explained to me that when a passenger dies in flight that it will normally be reported by their doctor as unnatural.  I guess I am to assume that dying in flight is not natural.  She apologized for the inconvenience and than asked to see the cockpit to which I complied.  My crew, both pilots and flight attendants, performed in an exemplary manner.  My First Officer and Relief Pilots shared the planning work load.  They began doing what was needed immediately.  QRH procedures for an overweight landing, clearances, as well as cabin to cockpit communication were equally shared like a fine precision watch runs.  Our Dispatcher, worked the weather problems on his end making my decisions and divert easier.  My flight attendants kept our passengers content and comfortable filling on board requests as they were made.  All of my crew members acted compassionately and professionally for which I would like to extend my thankfulness.

The First Officer was flying. He had done a RNAV approach with no problems and right on the glide path on the previous leg. He started this approach and flew the glide slope till about 400 FT. Then he started to go lower on the glide slope. I called 1/2 a dot low then 1 dot low. The PAPI lights had gone now to 3 red and one white I told him get back to the glide slope. He told me he was visual! I told him again to get back to the glide slope. He added power and got to between 1 dot to half a dot low. We cleared the runway displaced threshold at touch down. When we turned off I stopped the aircraft and I told him don't ever do that again! He now agreed. This type of approach activity is derived from the FAA and airline concept that the crew is responsible for clearance with terrain on a visual approach. Whenever you go below the glide slope or glide path in a transport category aircraft you open your self up for an accident. This should be changed in Part 121 that you never go below a glide slope, glide path, PAPI, or VASI lights on any visual approach. I have lost this argument in the past as the airline and the FAA will just shrug and brush it off.				B737 Captain reports his First Officer descending below glide slope during an ILS approach in VMC. The First Officer is instructed to get back on the glide slope and lands safely beyond the displaced threshold.

We completed all the MEL provisions including dripping the fuel tank and proper crossfeed valve operation.During climbout, I commented on the number two fuel indication going down (the side with the bad gauge). Shortly after level off at FL340 a fuel audit indicated a further indicated fuel imbalance. After summing the fuel indicated with fuel burned and subtracting this from the departure fuel, we determined that the indicated fuel imbalance was correct (5,700 LBS in number one and 3,800 LBS in number two). The crossfeed valve indicated closed. Further investigation revealed a popped crossfeed valve circuit breaker. We talked with Dispatch, complied with the Crossfeed Valve Inoperable QRH Checklist, declared an emergency and diverted to a nearby airport.The crossfeed valve indicated closed in flight, but was found to be in the open position by Maintenance. My mistake was confusion about whether or not the crossfeed valve circuit breaker could be reset with the limitation in the FOM.One additional item is that if a Crew declares an emergency, I think they should be pulled from flying at least the rest of that day period. It is very distracting.		We performed a fuel audit based on predeparture quantities and found that fuel was feeding out of right tank exclusively, that is, no fuel was being burned from the left tank. The crossfeed valve indications did not respond when we cycled the crossfeed knob.After assessing our fitness for continued duty, all five crew members expressed the ability to continue with our originally scheduled day. With a new aircraft, we then resumed our duty day. Two legs later, both of us found that our immediate mental situation was still fixated on the diversion scenario from earlier in the day. After discussing this, we both came to the agreement that in any situation, if a flight crew declares an emergency for any reason the flight crew should be relieved of duty upon landing, period. They should be given the option of dead heading either home or straight to their scheduled overnight, no questions asked. We need time to mentally de-brief the situation, write our narratives and file the appropriate paperwork then, instead of continuing and trying to resurrect it later. But in any event, they should be done with flying for that day, no questions asked.		Dispatched with one main fuel gauge deferred inoperative, a B737-700 flight crew noted that fuel was only being consumed from the tank with the inoperative gauge. An emergency was declared and the flight diverted.

Smooth flight. [We had a] normal descent, approach and touchdown. Selected reverse thrust. Engine 2 went into reverse but Engine 1 did not. [We got a] initial ECAM of number 1 engine reverser inoperative. [We] stopped aircraft on the runway and set parking break. Reverser ECAM went away and Green Hydraulic System Press Low ECAM displayed. Completed ECAM and referenced FM for additional information. [Our] nose wheel steering [was] inoperative due to loss of Green Hydraulic System. Tug arrived and we were towed to gate.		On landing rollout as pilot flying First Officer applied reverse thrust I noticed that #1 engine reverse was not deployed and aircraft was yawing slightly to right. First Officer kept us on centerline with rudder. As I mentioned that #1 thrust reverser was not deployed we got the ECAM #1 reverser fail. I called out the ECAM and commanded the First Officer to bring #2 engine to idle reverse, which he was already doing. At the same time we got multiple ECAMs related to the green hydraulic system. We had lost all green hydraulic fluid. I took control of the aircraft at 80 KTS and brought us to a stop on centerline. First Officer advised Tower that we had had a hydraulic failure on landing rollout and would not be able to clear the runway. At that point the First Officer ran the remaining ECAMs. I then made an announcement to the passengers to remain seated with seatbelts fastened, then spoke to the Flight Attendant on interphone, explained the situation and emphatically told her that no emergency existed and to make sure all passengers stayed in their seats. I wanted to ensure that no passengers initiated an unnecessary evacuation. We then contacted Dispatch informing them of our situation. We received a tow to the gate, where after the aircraft was secured I called Dispatch and the Chief Pilot. I am in the habit of checking both the fuel and hydraulic synoptic at Top of Descent and coming through 10,000 FT, so I can say with certainty that all hydraulic indications were normal at that time.		An A320's Green Hydraulic System line was damaged on landing causing the system to loose all fluid and pressure so that without nose wheel steering it had to be towed off the runway to the gate.

We initiated a go-around and told the Tower we were going around for a wind shear warning. The Tower gave us a heading of 290 and told us to contact Departure. We came back around for a normal landing on Runway 27. When we landed, we were asked to call the Tower Supervisor. The Tower Supervisor informed me that we had done nothing wrong; however, we were the second Company aircraft to go around for wind shear with no weather in the area. I told him it is Company policy to go around for a wind shear warning. He stated he was aware of that policy but asked me to pass on to the Company that its causes a problem for the Tower when they are landing 27 and taking off on 22. He asked me if the Company could take a look at the equipment in the airplane or our policy on go-arounds. I told him I would. The ATC Coordinator told me that he was aware of the problem.				Air Carrier on approach executed a go around after receiving a 'wind shear alert', ATC responding with follow up questions regarding company policy and aircraft equipment.

I noticed that the Valve Open light illuminated brightly, and then went out (instead of illuminating dimly). I tested the lights and found that they didn't work. I couldn't be sure if the valve was opened or closed. We changed the bulbs which confirmed that they were not the problem. We noticed the crossfeed valve circuit breaker was tripped and referenced the QRH. We allowed the center tank to drain and, soon thereafter, determined that the valve was likely stuck open due to a rapidly increasing fuel imbalance. I determined that for safety of flight, and to preclude a diversion with a definite fuel imbalance, I would attempt to close the valve by resetting the circuit breaker again. I placed the crossfeed valve switch in the open position because that is the position we believed the valve to be. As soon as I reset the circuit breaker, it tripped again but I was able to confirm that the valve was open by noticing a dim Valve Open light. I waited a few minutes and discussed our plan of action with the First Officer. I determined it best to put the valve in the closed position and have the First Officer monitor the Valve Open light while I reset the circuit breaker a third time to attempt to close the valve. After I reset the circuit breaker, we both saw a positive indication that the crossfeed valve did close (Dim to Bright to Off) and the circuit breaker did not trip again. We continued to monitor the fuel quantities closely and they maintained approximately a 500 LBS imbalance. We were able to continue to our destination. I weighed all the options and used my Captain's Authority when I elected to reset the circuit breaker three times in an attempt to close the crossfeed valve. I was well aware of the limitation in the FOM which states, 'A tripped circuit breaker may only be reset once.' Again, I felt a divert and landing with an increasing fuel imbalance was not prudent without attempting to close the valve. We notified Dispatch and Maintenance Control to inform them of our malfunction and they agreed we were okay to continue to our destination where repairs would be made. Maintenance confirmed a defective valve control when the circuit breaker tripped immediately after the valve was cycled.				B737 Captain reports crossfeed valve failure in the open position and an increasing fuel imbalance. The crossfeed valve circuit breaker is found to be tripped and after consideration, is reset and immediately trips again. The switch is placed in the closed position and the circuit breaker is reset a third time, closing the valve without tripping the circuit breaker.

We were on downwind and when I went to select no star to clean up the box. At that moment the MCDU stopped responding and I got a red map not available message on my display. That was followed by a cabin press LDG ELEV fault ECAM. Shortly after the First Officer commented he had also lost his map. At this point we were given a turn to base and were cleared to 4,000 FT. More failures followed by loss of INIT weights, auto tuned NAVAIDs and all flight plan data. While the First Officer continued to fly I quickly manually tuned the ILS on NAV panel. At that moment we were given an intercept vector and told to maintain 3,000 FT until established on ILS. There were broken clouds in the area at 1,600 FT. We continued on the ILS and also had the bridge in sight. [We] landed uneventfully. This was similar to a dual FMGC failure without the loss of autopilot 2 and auto throttles.	The Reporter determined that the FMGCs were the Thales updated units and that a post flight maintenance examination did not find any faults recorded for either FMGC. The restarts were normal and the system operated normally for 10 days at which time the #1 FMGC failed in flight. The #2 FMGC continued normal operation in that event. The Reporter still finds it odd that even though the #2 FMGC indicated failure the auto throttles and Autopilot continued functioning. A FMGC failure should have caused the automation systems to loose performance inputs which would automatically disconnect auto throttle computations and multiple autopilot inputs.	While descending and receiving vectors for downwind for Runway 28 , the Captain was cleaning up the flight plan page when his ND stop showing his map display and displayed the message 'map not available.' We then noticed the same thing on my ND with the loss of navigation data and the same message. We then got a CAB PRES LDG ELEV FAULT ECAM. I then noticed all my navigational data was lost including the destination VOR which was hard tuned and even my ILS scales on my PFD. The DDRMI had orange flags as well. At that point we lost all navigation capability and reference. The autopilot and auto throttles remained on during the event until on final when I turned them off. I told the Captain I lost all navigational info and he switched to standby navigation on his side. He manually tuned the ILS to 28 and got the ILS info on his PFD but I still did not have any navigational data. I selected ROSE ILS on my ND mode and picked up a good ILS signal with the IDENT but without DME. I just flew the final approach course referencing the rose ILS display. All the while we continued to take vectors to final and descent clearances. When cleared to intercept final we tried to arm the LOC mode but it would not arm, so I just intercepted manually using the heading mode. The Captain was looking in the FMC pages on the MCDU but everything was gone. All the flight plan data had dumped. While on final I called for managed speed but that was not available so we just used a selected speed referencing Vls. We broke out of the clouds about 1,500 FT and I got a little low on the glideslope but corrected. We were told to sidestep to Runway 28L which we did and landed and taxied to the gate without further complications. From the time we first lost our navigational data until the time we landed was about five minutes. After debriefing and taking time to sort out what happened, what we did and look in the flight manual, we suspect we did not have a total dual FMGC failure since the autopilot remained on but somehow lost all FMC flight plan data since all the capabilities which rely on that data were lost. I believe we handled the situation well. If we had more time we could have referenced the dual FMGC failure checklist, but we were concerned with getting some navigational reference and our situational awareness back while being vectored. The dual FMGC failure checklist would have had me also select standby navigation which may have given me ILS info on my PFD but I don't think we would have gained anything else. The Captain and I and flown together many times previously and I feel we handled the situation very well.		An A320 crew reported a Dual FMGC failure while on vectors for an ILS but the Autothrottles and Autopilot continued functioning on #2. They were unable to reset the FMGC's but manually tuned the ILS and completed an ILS below broken clouds.

First Officer was pilot flying. ATC issued usual speed restrictions and we briefed about that and the Aircraft ahead of us. Specifically [we were] to maintain 210 KTS to the first intersection then 170 to the second intersection. Descending from 3,600 FT from the third to the fourth intersection I noticed an unusually high sink rate. Looking at the flight plan page I noticed the constraint for the fourth intersection i.e., 2,400 FT, had dropped out of the box. The First Officer had a managed descent selected and the altitude selected in the altitude box was 1,800 for the restriction at the second intersection. I pointed out the conflicting info and the First Officer had already begun to make corrections. Due to a higher descent rate the aircraft did not level off immediately and simultaneously I believe due to the sink rate a terrain GPWS was triggered. I called missed approach and the First Officer performed a climbing maneuver commensurate with the GPWS warning. Another factor with this scenario is that we had a FWC failure during the flight that was giving other warnings that were not correct involving flap positions and speeds. In other words a great deal was happening at once during our go around. Priority was given to GPWS warning which was 'Terrain'. The procedures were followed correctly and we notified ATC we were going around. The following approach and landing was uneventful. After arriving at the gate I discussed at length with the Maintenance personnel what indications we were getting and they could not find any evidence of speed exceedances or control surface position. Although we had warnings generated perhaps by the faulty Flight Warning Computer (FWC)? I believe we generated a Terrain GPWS warning due to a sink rate issue. Regardless of the cause the necessary steps and actions were taken to maintain the safety of the aircraft. In this case a go around with priority for a terrain warning. Nothing occurred out of the ordinary other than a constraint issue on a non-precision approach. The deviation was identified and the proper action initiated. The additional factors with a failed FWC were a surprise. But flying the airplane was the priority. Perhaps a little more info related to such a system failure may be useful. Information provided by the QRH and subsequent equipment manuals are adequate for basic knowledge. I would have like to have known that there may be spurious warnings triggered for flight configurations. If in fact they do? Or maybe [it was] just a coincidence.	The Reporter stated that he talked with Maintenance personnel for at least a half hour after this event giving them as much information as he could and also trying to understand the indications the crew had in flight. The Flight Warning Computer (FWC) should not alert failure unless both computers have failed. The other odd thing related to the event was not a single equipment failure or flap exceedance was recorded in the automated fault logs.			An A320 FMGC dropped an arrival intersection altitude constraint and so the aircraft continued its descent to the point where the EGPWS issued a TERRAIN warning. During the go around a FWC failure caused incorrect flap position and speed alerts but neither the FWC failure nor flap exceedences were recorded in the automated post flight maintenance log.

Just as we started our descent, we received an ACARS message from Dispatch to come up on VHF. The Captain tuned the number two radio and handled the communications with Dispatch. The Captain told me due to the snow and having two deice trucks broken at our destination, they had wanted us to continue to our next destination. I immediately got out the performance numbers from the present position to the next destination. The numbers showed us landing with 4,000 pounds of fuel. I also sent an ACARS message to get the weather. Both the METAR and TAF showed the destination as VFR. Without discussing other options, the Captain got on the radio with ATC and told them we'd like to divert. I told him that it was going to be tight on fuel. He just kept saying that we are fine. When we got our routing to divert, it was an ATC clearance present position, the destination NAVAID, and then the Arrival to the airport. With this route in the FMC, it showed our arrival fuel at 3,800 pounds of fuel. I asked the Captain if he wanted to declare minimum fuel. He said no. I told him that the FMC is showing us landing at 3.8 and that is below the 4.0 minimum for landing.  The FOM requirement is 4.0 and if we land below 4.0, we are required to declare minimum fuel. The Captain stated that we don't have the correct winds plugged in and we should get direct up the road. He also stated the arrival weather was VFR, so we were fine. I wanted to get the point across to ATC so on our clearance to Center, I asked direct to the last fix on the arrival and stated that we were at minimum fuel. We received direct and also climbed from FL 400 to FL 410. We were updating the FMC with current wind conditions and it showed us going from in between 3.8 and 4.0 arrival fuel. When handed over to Approach Control, I stated to ATC that we are at minimum fuel and would appreciate direct to the field or to the final approach fix. Approach gave us a heading then asked which runway we'd prefer. I stated first available or 31 if you can work us in. He then gave us a clearance direct to the final approach fix for 31. We landed at 3.7 and taxied to the gate. After shutdown, we had 3.6 on the fuel gauges. In conclusion, since I had unsuccessfully been able to convince the Captain to actually state we are, 'Declaring minimum fuel' I still got on the radio and stated we were at minimum fuel. The Captain and I disagreed about my stating this and we had a discussion about it after we were done for the day. This is a communication error between the Captain and me. I had wished the Captain was more receptive to my interpretation of the rules. I believe highly in Crew communication and we had a CRM breakdown over this issue.  Since I gave ATC the heads-up about our fuel situation they gave us direct clearances, a higher altitude, and direct to the final approach fix for 31. I am glad I stated that we were at minimum fuel since we landed above the FAR minimum, but we were below the 4.0 required by the FOM. I think there needs to be better communication between the Crew about the intentions of the Crew during a diversion. I think that even if the FMC is showing landing at 4.0 on the fuel that the Crew should declare minimum fuel. There was a definite breakdown in CRM about the statement of declaring minimum fuel and the interpretations of the rule between the Captain and myself. I appreciated the direct route clearances from ATC and the higher altitude to conserve fuel. ATC helped us out when I gave them a heads- up about our fuel issue.				A B737 diverted because of weather and FMC calculated landing fuel became less than 4,000 pounds. The Captain did not want to declare minimum fuel so the First Officer did and the aircraft landed with 3,700 pounds.

The aircraft had not flown the day before and accumulated a large amount of contaminates on the aircraft surfaces.  There was no contaminates in the engines and the fan section turned freely. After engine start we were directed to taxi to the deice pad.  Two  vehicles arrived and began to deice the aircraft which were joined by another two vehicles after twenty minutes.  This process took about two hours to complete before the Deice Coordinator declared the aircraft free of contaminates.  After the engines were started, we taxied the aircraft for departure when we received a radio call from the Deice Coordinator that he spotted some contaminates still on the aircraft.   We returned to the deice pad, configured the aircraft for deicing, and had the deice truck remove any contaminates they found.  This deice process took another twenty minutes.  We were cleared for takeoff and after V1, when the First Officer made the rotate call, I noticed we were about five knots slow.  This got my attention as I waited about one second and starting rotating the aircraft.  The aircraft nose was off the ground and I got multiple warnings on the PFD for airspeed and altitude disagreement along with a momentary stick shaker.  I noticed the airspeed was rolling back to 45 knots and the altitude was remaining on field elevation. A buffet alert was displayed on the CDU as well. A quick glance and the First Officer's PFD showed normal indications and, after we retracted the gear, I gave him the aircraft.  We got an immediate call from ATC wanting to know our altitude which I gave off the First Officer's altimeter.  I quickly selected the number two position on the transponder to avoid further ATC interruptions.  We climbed to 6000 feet and informed ATC that we needed to return but needed radar vectors to troubleshoot the problem and prepare for an approach.  I ran the QRH checklist while the First Officer flew the aircraft, but we did not recover the Captain's airspeed or altitude indications.  We elected to burn down fuel to landing limits.  We received a clearance for a visual approach and on short final in visual conditions, a one-second windshear warning was received with no external indications or indications on the First Officer's instruments.  Considering the circumstances and the very real possibility the system was getting inaccurate information from the Captain's altimeter and airspeed, the First Officer stated his intention to continue to land.  I concurred and a normal flaps 30 landing was flown by the First Officer .  After returning to the gate, Contract Maintenance found ice contaminates in both the left and right pitot static systems.In severe ground icing conditions, a cover should be placed over the static ports to prevent introduction of contaminants into the -700 pitot static system.  Ground Deicing Crews should be trained repeatedly about the dangers of getting deice fluid in pitot static ports during deice and anti-ice operations.		We were originating the aircraft which had sat on the ramp during a major snowstorm for approximately the past thirty-six hours. The aircraft was completely coated in snow/ice to the point that I could not read the writing on the winglets during the preflight inspection. The engines were noted to be free of ice and snow. It was a normal engine start and taxi to a remote deice pad. The Ice Man advised that his two trucks probably did not have enough fluid to deice our aircraft so a Contract Deicer took over. Even with as many as four trucks spraying our aircraft, it took almost two hours to clean the aircraft with no precipitation falling. We received the clean aircraft clearance from the Contract Deicer and began the taxi to the runway. During the taxi, we received a call from Operations saying our personnel had observed additional contaminates on the tail of the aircraft so we returned to deice pad for further removal by Company employees. That complete, we taxied to the runway. I was the Pilot Monitoring. At rotation, the Captain remarked that he was receiving unreliable airspeed and altimeter information, and, after observing that my instruments appeared accurate, transferred control of the aircraft to me and selected the number two transponder to assist ATC. Approach Control should be commended for their handling of the situation as they accommodated our requests without hesitation and offered to arrange ground assistance should we need it. We were able to complete an uneventful flaps 30 visual approach. After returning to the gate, Contract Maintenance reported that they had discovered frozen internal plumbing on both static ports, which they subsequently thawed, drained, and dried. After completing the requisite paperwork, we again departed, this time uneventfully.I am not an engineer so I do not know how to fix the frozen plumbing issue on the static ports. But I do know that I would not prefer to find out about it at rotation. We were fortunate in that it was VFR and that my instruments worked correctly. Suppose it had been low IFR and my instruments had also failed, then we would have had a full-blown emergency.		B737-700 Flight Crew experiences Captain's pitot static instrument failure at rotation.  The aircraft had been on the ground for 36 hours in a snow and ice storm before this departure.  Maintenance found ice in the plumbing of both pitot static systems.

Runway 23 was closed and being used for deicing procedures. I was cleared to fly, and had intercepted, the ILS 18C CLT. I was cleared to land 18C. ATC requested 170KIAS until OZEJI. Flying a dual-coupled approach, I was instructed to turn off the localizer approach for re-sequencing due to proximity to an aircraft on approach to 18R, not previously mentioned by approach control. We had seen the aircraft on TCAS, though we had not received a TCAS TA. When we had started the approach he had been to our right lined up on 18R, approximately 2.5 miles in front of us. Flying the requested speed, I saw our distance to the aircraft on the parallel approach decrease to less than a mile when approach vectored us off our approach. Upon re-sequencing, we were very alert to aircraft approaching the parallel runway. Again we were cleared and were flying a coupled ILS 18C approach. We were cleared to land. Approach requested we fly 170 KIAS since we were 6.5 miles behind the aircraft in front of us to 18C. We were only 2.5 miles behind and to the east of an aircraft flying the ILS to 18R. As this distance diminished, we queried approach control about the speed but he insisted we stay at 170. We complied and saw the distance continue to decrease. We received a TA highlighting the aircraft on approach to 18R we had been watching. We questioned approach and they broke off our approach again vectoring us around for re-sequencing. On the third approach we successfully landed. The Approach Controller and monitor or supervisor, we heard two distinct voices, were only worried with the horizontal spacing between aircraft assigned to the same runway. They were so intent on keeping a particular distance; they appeared to give no consideration to position relative to a parallel runway. In two instances the speed they requested of us caused closure to a near parallel position to an aircraft on the parallel approach. The aircraft on the parallel approach drifted off course enough to pose a potential threat to our flight, necessitating breaking off our approach and being re-sequenced in the pattern. On the first approach, the vectoring occurred before a TCAS TA occurred. On the second approach a TCAS TA occurred. Suggestions: 1. In a non-normal situation using Runway 5/23 for deicing procedures consider using the east and west runway for approaches and the center runway for departures. 2. Suspend controller training during adverse weather/non-normal operations. Let them observe, but not control. 3. Institute requirements that controllers keep nose/tail, for lack of a better term, separation distances not only for aircraft on approach to a runway but for those on near parallel runways. I am not suggesting the same distance but simply not having a parallel approach pass one another. There are too many things that can go wrong since the thresholds are approximately parallel, hence parallel glide paths.				An Air Carrier experienced multiple go arounds at CLT during simultaneous approach procedures.

While on RADAR vectors with Norcal Approach in IMC conditions we were given clearance to descend and maintain 5,000 FT. As the aircraft started to level off at 5,000, we received an automated terrain alert 'Terrain Terrain Pull UP' from the EGPWS. We immediately initiated the terrain escape maneuver climbing to approximately 5,600 FT. The Captain contacted ATC to advise them of our climb. We quickly flew into VMC conditions and were able to visually verify our flight path and stopped the climb. ATC re-cleared us to 5,000 FT and we continued the approached uneventfully.		The Flight Crew of an Air Carrier inbound to OAK reported an EPGWS warning near Mt. Diablo when complying with an ATC issued a descend clearance to 5,000.

We were getting light chop on the approach with no reports of windshear by any preceding aircraft. As we rolled out behind our traffic, we hit what we perceived [to be] wake turbulence. The aircraft rolled to the left and triggered the windshear warning. As the Pilot Flying, I disengaged the autopilot and corrected the roll. By that time the windshear warning had gone away. All the instruments seemed normal and we landed normally.  Once on the ground, the Captain and I talked over the situation and decided that we should not have second-guessed the technology in the aircraft. The windshear warning is a mandatory go-around.				A B737-700 First Officer reported a wake vortex encounter on approach to BWI triggered a windshear warning that the crew chose to ignore because they were sure of its cause.

I flew this aircraft today, and inputted the 9999 airport elevation correction as required per the bulletin. I flew the approach in AI mode. The FPV at 200 feet was superimposed exactly on the VASI, instead of on the runway. The same lateral displacement of the FPV continued to below fifty feet AGL until the FPV disappeared during the 'flare' mode. I need to point out that the bulletin indicates the error to be slightly displaced off of the runway centerline. In fact, WITH the correction, or 'software work-around', the FPV, was, as I said, imposed over the VASI off the left side of the runway. I have heard from other pilots that the same thing occurs on other newer HUD aircraft. I have yet to fly a new jet in CATII or CATIII. I seriously doubt the low visibility certifiable of this HUD if the FAA was aware of the actual FPV image in the aircraft on an actual approach. This 'software' issue was supposed to be completed by the end of November.				A B737-800 Captain reported the new HGS 4000 HUD flight path vector (FPV) was centered on the VASI off the left side of the runway and not on the runway surface.

Suspect this ECAM was inhibited until 1500ft/3 min after take off. We continued clean-up, followed by the appropriate abnormal procedures. Continuing on our departure routing, immediate contact and coordination was established with Dispatch and Maintenance via SAT phone. Without hesitation, Dispatch indicated this ECAM required a return to field and Maintenance concurred. All three pilots and an A330 qualified FAA Air Carrier Operations Safety Inspector (occupying a flight deck jump seat) agreed this was the safest and most prudent action to take as well. Although the abnormal was a lower priority ECAM, we felt the many unknowns (for example, fuel contamination) and ultimate possibility of engine failure or degraded performance made a controlled two engine overweight landing a much safer course of action. As a precaution an emergency was declared with ATC. Our actual landing weight was 462,560 lbs with a touchdown sink rate of 280 FPS. We had airport fire equipment follow us to parking after landing in case hot brakes became an issue. Brakes temps remained normal after landing and the fire department was advised the aircraft was secure. Per Maintenance the touchdown parameters did not require an over weight landing inspection. After maintenance action and underway again I realized I had not put my signature on the appropriate log white page block. I did sign the remaining pink sheet copy however. Task saturation and many distractions had occurred. The task loading at the gate before and after the flight was significant. Sometimes I feel it is almost over whelming.				An A330 Captain experienced an 'ENG 2 FUEL FILTER CLOGGED' ECAM shortly after takeoff and returned for an overweight landing.

We were very familiar with the terrain and threats during a 26 approach to ABQ. We were cleared for the approach to follow [another carrier] on final. I built the runway with a five-mile extension to intercept five miles at 1,500 FT above the ground. As I was descending through 7,500, around 7,000, we received the 'Caution Terrain' warning. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and climbed to 7,500, and the warning ceased. We continued the approach uneventfully.Before I descended from 7,500, I looked at the terrain on my MFD and only saw light green terrain. I knew there was a large mountain in our vicinity, but thought we were clear of the terrain before I descended. I performed a turning descent which set off the 'Terrain Caution' warning. I responded immediately to it. I should have stayed at 7,500 and configured for landing and not descended from our final approach altitude until I was within ten degrees of our approach centerline. This would have avoided the warning. I would also request a right downwind if possible when arriving from the west at night due to the terrain positioned just left of the centerline on Runway 26.		Stay at altitude, configure earlier, and wait until on the final to begin the descent. We were aware of and discussed terrain. The surprise is how quickly it went from green on the MFD to a terrain caution with such little descent rate. In reality the system worked as advertised. Right downwind?

We were in moderate icing from 14,500 to approximately FL270.  We had engine and wing anti-ice systems on and operating.  We were both very concerned about the amount of ice building on the airplane as evidenced by the significant amount building on the probe between the windscreens and all of the way around the two front windscreens.  I selected Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) at about FL180 to facilitate climbing through the icing more quickly.  Our clearance was to FL230 which was set in the FCU window with the autopilot flying.  We were both significantly distracted talking about and observing the icing and also coming up with a plan of action, that our brains were focused on climbing out of the icing.  So when the autopilot leveled off at FL230, the airplane kept accelerating since we were still in MCT.  Thinking we were getting unreliable airspeed due to icing, and expecting to keep climbing instead of being level, I disconnected the autopilot and pulled up.  The altitude alert went off at 23,300 FT and I realized what happened and started back down to FL230 after reaching 23,400 FT.  Also contributing was that during the climbout, the VVI (Vertical Velocity Indicator) fluctuated between -300 and +1,100, so seeing the VVI at 0 was somewhat expected in the back of my mind.  Our concern was the unknown amount and weight of the ice on the unheated parts of the airplane since the ice did not sublimate enroute.				A320 flight crew becomes concerned with ice build up during climb and selects MCT to expedite the climb.  When the autopilot levels off at FL230 the aircraft rapidly accelerates.  The pilot flying disengages the autopilot and begins to climb before the altitude chime alerts him to the altitude clearance and that the MCT setting is causing the airspeed increase.

We were cleared to 2000 FT MSL and cleared the instrument approach to ILS XXR to ZZZ by Approach Control. Just prior to intercepting the glide slope at 2,000 FT MSL, we were asked if we could see the aircraft that ATC said was approximately 4-5 miles ahead of us. We had been cleared for the ILS approach and precisely followed all of the controller instructions. We were unable to positively identify the preceding aircraft because it was below us on the glide slope and blended in with the numerous ground lights. The Captain informed ATC that we did not see the preceding aircraft. The Tower Controller instructed us to maintain 2,000 FT MSL and continue straight ahead. We were vectored back for the 4R ILS approach. We were ahead of our fuel plan as we passed ZZZZZ on the arrival. Due to some vectoring for the initial approach and the subsequent go around we determined that we were at a minimum fuel state while on downwind for the second approach. The Captain informed ATC that we were minimum fuel and asked the Controller how long it would take to get us on the ground. The Controller said that we were number 5 or 6, I don't recall which one, for the approach but did not give us a time to landing. The Captain asked again how long it would be until we landed, saying we were minimum fuel and he needed this information to determine if he needed to declare an emergency. The Controller did not provide us with a time to landing instead we were asked how much fuel/how long of a delay could we accept. At this time the Captain checked the fuel state and number of aircraft ahead of us and decided to declare an emergency for low fuel. I don't believe we were given traffic priority after declaring the emergency, and were subsequently sequenced in with the traffic on the ILS XXR approach. The approach and landing were uneventful and as we exited the runway we received a fuel quantity low EICAS message. We were not told that we may be required to transition to a visual approach in order to land after being cleared for the instrument (XXR ILS) approach. We followed all controller instructions and complied with all applicable regulations and procedures.				Air Carrier on an ILS approach was issued a go around because they were unable to sight preceding traffic resulting in a fuel emergency declaration, the reporter claiming ATC failed to afford appropriate priority.

The First Officer was the pilot flying and I was the pilot not flying. We both confirmed the number two engine fire and I performed the engine fire/severe damage memory items at which time we declared an emergency and received vectors to a nearby city. After pulling the number two engine fire handle, the fire light extinguished. During vectors we completed the QRH checklist items, including the Single Engine Landing Checklist, advised the flight attendants of the engine fire and shutdown, and told them we would be landing at nearby airport and to prepare the cabin for landing. I also let them know the fire light was out, we would not be evacuating at this time, and we had approximately one or two minutes before landing. I made an announcement to the passengers stating we had indications of an engine fire, we shut the engine down, the fire was extinguished, and we would be diverting. While I was doing the checklist and communicating with the flight attendants and passengers, the First Officer was descending and turning a visual approach for our diversion airport. After stabilized and configured for landing, we transferred control and I landed the aircraft. Upon landing we brought the aircraft to a stop on the high-speed taxiway clear of the runway, told the passengers and flight attendants to remain seated, and communicated with Ground Control and Fire/Rescue to inspect the aircraft for smoke or fire. We made an announcement to the passengers and let them know once cleared by Fire/Rescue we would continue to the gate. Fire/Rescue confirmed there was no fire and smoke and we continued to the gate. At the gate, we spoke with the flight attendants to make sure they were fine, spoke with Maintenance about the engine fire. I spoke with Dispatch, Maintenance Control, and the Chief Pilot at which point the aircraft was taken out of service and we were pulled from the remainder of our pairing along with the flight attendants. I cannot say enough about the professionalism of our crew. The flight attendants were calm and collected through the entire event and never wavered in their professionalism. The First Officer flew the aircraft as if he had been in this situation a million times showing incredible airmanship. I believe the good outcome of this situation was based on good crew communication and training. I do believe the procedure of having the Captain land instead of the pilot flying land is outdated. We were only in the air eight minutes total and only five minutes after the first indication of a fire. My pilot monitoring duties were many and the First Officer was doing an excellent job of flying. Our procedure to switch control just so the Captain can land when the First Officer is doing a great job and I am in the communication mode is just another burden you don't need at a critical phase of flight.

At approximately FL200, we transitioned from VMC to IMC in a large non-CB cloud that had no significant signature on our RADAR.  We  experienced light turbulence and did not notice any precipitation.  At approximately FL250, 'IAS DISAGREE' was displayed on both PFDs.  There were differences (relatively minor) in Captain and First Officer IAS and Mach.  We complied with the QRH 'IAS DISAGREE' and 'Flight with unreliable airspeed' checklists.  We also consulted the Performance Handbook for Pitch/Power information.  We confirmed that the Pitot Probe Heat was ON.  By approximately FL280, we transitioned to VMC again with no further IMC in sight ahead of us. The 'IAS DISAGREE' message cleared and all indications became normal again. Our OPT altitude was FL350. Our flight plan altitude was FL330 in this segment. We elected to amend our cleared altitude to FL330 to increase speed margins should the  problem re-occur.  We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance control for guidance and possible air  turn-back.  We informed them of what had just happened and that all seemed normal at this time. They suggested we continue towards our intended destination.  We concurred. Note that our ETOPS Entry Point was still ahead.  The flight proceeded normally with no further anomalies during the cruise phase. As a precaution, we compiled an abbreviated list of pertinent Pitch/Power/VS combinations for our descent should the problem resurface.  During our descent, we re-entered IMC passing through FL250. The 'IAS DISAGREE' message was displayed once again on both PFDs and we noted differences between Captain and First Officer IAS and Mach. The differences became significant.  We noted initially on PFD's: CAPT IAS=296kt, M 0.74, First Officer IAS=315kt, M=0.77.  We noted conflicting information on Nav Display TAS and wind read-outs. We obtained Ground Speed readouts from ATC. We cross-checked other instruments such as the HUD Angle-of-Attack readout. The EECs soon reverted to ALTN. We complied with the QRH and placed the EECs in 'hard ALTN'.  The situation led us to DECLARE AN EMERGENCY before reaching 10,000ft.  Differences in Captain and First Officer IAS became very significant (Captain IAS 170kt, First Officer 250kt). It was clear that the Captain information was erroneous, therefore controls were transfered to the First Officer. A momentary stick shaker occurred while the First Officer IAS was 240kt with normal Angle-of-Attack indication in the HUD and normal Ground Speed. The approach continued without further incident. We selected a target approach speed of Vref+20kt to account for possible unknowns.At this time, I do not know what caused the Captain ADIRU (Air Data Inertial Reference Unit) to malfunction.				A B737-800 Flight Crew struggled with recurring erroneous air data information ultimately tracked down to a malfunctioning ADIRU (Air Data Inertial Reference Unit).

With the initiation of the second engine start the maintenance release started printing on ACARS. We also noticed at that time that runway 1L was in use. We got the latest ATIS and the data for Runway 1L. Captain made the appropriate changes on the flight plan and performance page and I called for taxi. ATC instructions involved back-taxiing on Runway 1R-19L with a couple of taxiway turns before and after. We started taxiing and I selected flaps and was backing the Captain up with the clearance.   While on Runway 1R ground told us to contact clearance for a reroute. As I copied the clearance, the Captain inserted the changes. I verified and continued the checklist from the manifest changes. When we went back to ground control they sent us back to tower for an immediate takeoff. The Captain applied full power on the brakes and we started down the runway. As I always do when checking the proper power settings, I glanced at the flaps and performance data. I noticed it called for flaps 3 and we had flaps 1. I told the Captain we should abort the takeoff because we had an improper flap setting. He quickly looked trying to assess. While maintaining directional control he decided to continue because we were accelerating very quickly. He delayed the rotation about 15K and we got airborne.		[I] accomplished first flight-of-day checks and normal cockpit preparation. I conducted initial trip briefing and the briefing for this flight as I would be pilot flying. I expected and briefed departure from 19R and engine failure profile for first flight of day. No maintenance item due to a maintenance walk needed. Operations were notified and they contacted maintenance to remedy. Before Start and Pushback Checklists [were] completed. Shortly before departure time, Operations informed us the maintenance walk around issue had been resolved and to expect new maintenance release. About this time, ground crew called saying checklist complete and release brakes if you want. [We were] told by ATC to hold on gate. I told pushback crew we were instructed to hold. Pushback crew again asked for brake release. I responded that I can't release brakes until I receive pushback clearance. I mention this because it was an additional distraction combined with the following distractions. We noticed that departures were using 1L and First Officer started ACARS request for 1L performance. At this time, we received ATC pushback clearance. Normal pushback and both engines started. The maintenance release came across the printer as we finished engine start. ATC instructed us to taxi 1L Alpha hold short Juliet. As we proceeded, we discussed that we would need a new departure procedure or a heading and vectors departing 1L. This uncertainty was a contributing distraction. Before reaching Juliet, instructed taxi Juliet back taxi 1R Hotel Alpha hold short Delta. As we turned off 1R, we began the before takeoff checklist. This was completed down to the manifest changes line. Flaps had been set to flaps 1. I responded to the checklist item with 1 planned 1+F indicated detent. 1L takeoff performance data called for flaps 3. I am very familiar with SNA departures and should have noticed the mistaken flap setting at this time. I am also very familiar with the 19R pre-curfew taxi routing. I believe the unusual taxi routing combined with the late recognition of 1L being the active runway offered further distraction. As we turned onto Taxiway Alpha, ATC instructed us to contact clearance for new routing. After inserting the new route and altitude, we finished the checklist but were again distracted by the new changes to the manifest changes portion of the before takeoff checklist. We were given line up and wait clearance. The pacing was quick but not hurried. We received takeoff clearance and I held the brakes to 1.10 EPR and selected toga thrust and released brakes. This is the 19R noise abatement procedure but I elected to use it for better performance. At 130,000 LBS, we accelerated quickly. Accelerating through 80 KTS, I heard the First Officer say something regarding the flap setting. By the time I processed what the First Officer said about the flaps, considering our relatively light weight and rapid acceleration, I felt the safest course of action was to continue the takeoff and verbalized this to the First Officer. I delayed rotation to a speed approximately 10-15 KTS beyond Vr. In retrospect, I needed to slow down the operation as our tasks increased. I allowed several distractions and work flow interruptions to affect the safety of our flight.		Following a plethora of runway and routing changes during pushback and taxi, the flight crew of an A320 failed to note the need for flap setting three vice one on takeoff from SNA.  When alerted by the First Officer well into the takeoff roll the Captain elected to increase the Vr speed and continue the takeoff.

The pre-takeoff conversation with the Dispatcher was routine, and the Dispatcher's plan was accepted showing an arrival fuel of approximately 18,000 LBS and arriving approximately four minutes late. Due to winds enroute and inclement weather in Europe, the plan was to fly a re-dispatch flight plan. The planned landing fuel of approximately 18,800 LBS seemed adequate although raising the fuel 2,000 LBS was considered due to the flight history record showing five of the last seven flights exceeding the planned burn by about that amount. The flight departed on time, with a normal taxi time and fuel and brake release at the cleared fuel amount. Shortly after takeoff climbing through approximately 15,000 FT, we experienced an EICAS ELEC GEN DRIVE L (Electric Generator Drive Left) message which directed disconnecting the left generator drive and starting the APU. At this point all four pilots were still on the flight deck. Although we understood the operational implications, there might be an ETOPS impact we were not aware of. We requested and received clearance to hold at the next point along our route of flight, which was within ten miles of our present position. After consulting with Dispatch and Maintenance it was determined we could continue to our planned destination with a total penalty of approximately 8,400 LBS for continuous APU operation and drag from the APU inlet door. We would land with an acceptable, but not generous, fifty plus minutes of arrival fuel at our destination. The total delay to assess and determine our action was less than ten minutes. As the flight progressed it became apparent that the fuel burn was exceeding the dispatch estimate and the updated fuel usage log figures by an average of 200-300 LBS/hour. Dispatch was informed before coast-out that we were over burning their estimate but we were fairly confident we could make the ocean crossing with adequate reserves. If not, we would stop at our planned refueling station. Before going on break, the relief pilots were instructed to inform me if the landing fuel changed significantly or a divert seemed likely. In several communications with Dispatch as the flight progressed, it became apparent that the fuel would be 1,000-2,000 LBS below the fuel required at the re-dispatch fix. I asked that all options be examined to allow the flight to continue to the planned destination but the Dispatcher informed me that no scenario would allow us to continue to that airport and they were planning a divert for refueling. I asked if crew duty issues would become a factor and I was told that duty time would not likely be an issue. Landing at the divert airport was uneventful, with arrival fuel around 11,000-12,000 LBS. Ground handling was very slow, taking approximately 45 minutes from landing to block in, due to a jetway steering problem. The station finally resorted to using a stair truck to access the aircraft from Door 1R. Departure from the divert airport was uneventful, and the flight arrived in at our destination approximately two hours twenty minutes later than scheduled arrival time.				A B777 Captain reported that after takeoff on an oceanic flight the EICAS alerted ELEC GEN DRIVE L which required that the APU generator be ON for ETOPS operations. Because of the increased APU fuel burn the flight had a fuel stop at the re-dispatch diversion airport.

We preformed an engine start at the gate using external air followed by a cross- bleed start. During the walk around, the First Officer noted minor ice accumulation on the wings. We elected to have the aircraft de-iced. We taxied to the de-ice pad for deicing. After de-icing was complete we taxied to our runway for takeoff. The 'ECAM Status Check', last item before taking the runway, showed [we had] 'Aft Cargo Heat' and 'Aft Cargo Vent' inoperative. We advised Ground and taxied north of the runway entrance and contacted Maintenance via ACARS. The Maintenance Controller responded with a recommendation to pull and reset two circuit breakers which cleared the ECAM status page. Once the Status page was cleared and all procedures and checklist were complete we taxied to the runway and were cleared for takeoff. The takeoff was normal. I reduced power to climb thrust and was calling for 'FLAPS UP.' We were handed off to Departure frequency when we received a Master Warning light and an ECAM warning of smoke in the aft cargo compartment. I flew the aircraft while the First Officer ran the ECAM. At this time, the Purser called to advise that we had smoke in the cabin and that all three lavatories fire detectors were flashing indicating fire. Though the First Officer and I were aware of the previous APU write up, we elected to treat this as an actual in flight fire and declare an emergency. We notified ATC, donned our O2 masks, and he continued to run AFT CARGO FIRE ECAM. ATC gave us vectors to the nearest runway. We continued to receive Master Warnings and Smoke ECAMS. We specifically chose not to Emergency Cancel the message, since it gave us an indication that the situation was continuing. The Purser called to inform us that it appeared that the smoke was heavier in the rear section of the aircraft. This added to the urgency of the situation. We informed the Purser to prepare the cabin with four minutes remaining to touchdown. I was on a base to the runway configuring the aircraft for landing. On final I observed we had full emergency vehicle support on the ground. The First Officer and I discussed the need for an evacuation. The outside air temperature was 18 F with about ten inches of snow on the ground. We both suspected that the smoke was caused by the APU oil leak. On short final the First Officer called the Purser for an update. He informed us that the smoke had diminished considerably. We instructed him to only perform an evacuation if smoke increased or the situation deteriorated. We preformed a smooth overweight landing. The First Officer made a 'remain seated' PA announcement. We exited on the high speed and Tower handed us off to the Fire Control frequency. The emergency personal did a full inspection of the aft cargo area that also included thermal imaging. They informed us that the imaging showed only slightly warmer temperatures surrounding that area. We requested an escort to the gate and proceeded. We deplaned the passengers normally.		Aircraft came into the gate.  We had gotten a call that APU auto shut down on taxi in.  [I] then got a call that they had low oil level.  Found oil level below sight gauge.  Added three quarts serviced to full.  Started APU to check for leaks in compartment. None found.  Loaded up APU electrical and air at which time we got smoke in cabin.  Shut APU down and rechecked oil level was empty again. Defer APU reference MEL 4910.  Ran #1 engine for approximately thirty minutes to burn packs out. Cleared cabin of smoke but still had a slight oil smell.  I had forgotten to enter oil in oil service display but oil quantity was stated in deferral text.		An A320 APU auto shut down on taxi in due to an oil leak. During maintenance troubleshooting leaking oil got into the air conditioning system and caused smoke. The APU was MEL'ed but after takeoff the cabin filled with smoke causing the crew to declare an emergency and return to land.

The pilot flying correctly initiated a normal go-around while I simultaneously called 'go around.' On the go around, a radar test pattern came up on both our inboard display units. Throughout the flight, both of us had 'terrain' selected. The ride on approach was smooth and the winds were steady with no reports of gusts. In my opinion, the predictive windshear warning we encountered was erroneous. No indications of windshear were seen at any time. We did not use the weather radar at any time during the flight and all the preflight systems checks were normal.				B737 Captain experiences a predictive windshear alert at low altitude during approach in VMC and goes around. System malfunction is suspected.

He managed to close and latch the window prior to 80 KTS. On climbout he reported a loud squeal from the window and discovered his headset cord had become entangled in the upper aft part of the window and inhibited a good seal. We leveled at 7,000 FT and requested return to our departure airport. Conferred with Dispatch for landing data and Maintenance Control regarding our expected overweight landing. Landing was normal and soft.The First Officer reported he did not open the window at any time prior to the incident. We were unable to determine if the window was unlatched prior to his duties or if it was a mechanical failure of the window latch.		In the future I will ensure that the window is closed AND latched as part of my preflight checks. A mechanic meeting the plane also showed me a better way to route my headset cord so that an open window (intentionally or otherwise) would not catch the cord when the window is re-closed.		A B737-800 First Officer failed to note his cockpit window was not securely latched until it opened on takeoff roll. His attempt to resecure it failed when his headset cord was caught and caused an excessively loud pressure leak. A return to the departure airport was necessary.

While at the gate we initiated a conference call with Dispatch and Maintenance to obtain further details of what had actually occurred, and what Maintenance had discovered and accomplished on the aircraft. Maintenance advised us that repairs had been made and that the aircraft was being returned to service. Although engine runs had been performed on the ground, no test flight had occurred. We advised Dispatch that if any problems resembling the previous history occurred on our flight after departure that our intent was to return. I conducted a more thorough briefing than normal with the Flight Attendants, specifically advising them that if they detected any cabin smoke or fumes, not to hesitate in notifying the cockpit crew. Hazmat was loaded in the aft cargo pit (radio active). Soon after takeoff, we detected a very slight oily odor in the cockpit, similar to the smell you get in flight after being deiced. The First Officer and I were both comfortable continuing. About 12 minutes after takeoff, the Purser advised me that the Flight Attendants in the aft cabin were detecting a slight odor. I asked him if he thought it was bad enough to return. He went to the aft cabin himself to assess and then advised me 'not at this time'. Several minutes later I was advised by the Flight Attendants that it was getting 'really bad', especially near the lavatories in the aft cabin. I decided immediately to return. An emergency was declared and we returned expeditiously. We advised Tower and the rescue personnel that we were transporting hazmat in the aft cargo compartment. I commend my entire crew for an exemplary job during a stressful situation. A normal landing occurred and no injuries occurred. In hind-sight, I think this aircraft should have had a maintenance test flight prior to being returned to revenue service.				A320 flight crew is dispatched in an aircraft with a maintenance history of smoke and fumes from a right engine oil leak. Approaching FL340 the problem returns and the crew elects to return to the departure airport.

All takeoff bug speeds were verified in accordance with normal procedures. I was Captain and pilot flying. During takeoff roll, V1 auto-callout was announced by the aircraft 20 knots early. I eased back on the yoke and began rotation, when I realized I was below rotation speed. There was no pilot monitoring callout for rotation. I eased the nose of the aircraft back to the runway. I then rotated at the normal rotation speed and achieved approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155-160 KTS. Everything else seemed normal. At 10,000 FT, after the sterile chime, a Flight Attendant asked me about the attempted rotation and set down. Her verbiage was approximately, 'What was that bump?' I explained what had happened and inquired if she heard any scraping. She said no. We pressurized normally and continued to our destination. At 3 hours into the flight (approximately), the flight attendants expressed concern that we had scraped the aircraft on takeoff, but were not sure. Upon receiving this new information, the copilot and I conducted the suspected tail-strike on takeoff portion of the QRH. We landed without declaring an emergency at our scheduled destination. After landing, and upon a post flight inspection, damage to the tail-skid was discovered. Dispatch and Chief Pilot were contacted.		During preflight, I followed all normal procedures. The takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload to the FMC. I manually inputted the correct V speed from the paperwork into the FMC. I verified they matched prior to pushback. There was no runway change from what I expected prior to pushback to what we received for our takeoff runway. During our takeoff roll, V1 was called early by the auto-voice. I think it was early by about 20 KTS. The Captain started a slow rotation. I knew it was too early, but was unsure of what procedure to advise him to stop rotation. I didn't want to say STOP or ROTATE for fear of confusion. He also recognized the problem shortly after I did and lowered the nose to the ground. Our takeoff then proceeded normally. After 10,000 FT, the Captain spoke with the Flight Attendant and she did not think there was a tail scraping during our takeoff. After about 3 hours more, the Flight Attendants decided we might have scraped some metal on takeoff. We did the QRH procedure for tail strike on takeoff and landed at our destination uneventfully. Because we suspected damage, we conducted a thorough exterior inspection and found some damage on the tail skid plate.		A B737-800 Captain rotated 20 KTS below V1 when the autovoice V1 erroneously made the callout and then set down for a short period before rotating again. During the second rotation a tail strike occurred which flight attendants reported but the pilots did not immediately react to the report.

I turned abeam the northern edge of MacDill, cut across the corner of the field boundary, continued the turn to a more northerly direction, and descended below 2,600 FT. ATC said we were too low over MacDill and we said we were north of MacDill Runway 4, but still over the field boundary. Then ATC said we were actually 3/4 mile north of MacDill and that we didn't turn over MacDill. We said we did, but always stayed north of the runway. He canceled the clearance and had us climb back to 2,600 FT and turned us back to a 270 heading for a few moments before re-clearing us for a visual approach. That clearance he gave has always, in the past, meant to stay at 2,600 FT until south of the runways which we did. We felt we had complied with his instructions since there wasn't a definite point over MacDill given. I suppose he wanted us to fly further south before turning in to the runway and descending, but if we had, I would still have descended where I did at the north field boundary.				Air Carrier on visual approach to TPA was questioned by ATC regarding apparent no compliance with altitude crossing restrictions over MacDill AFB.

I was late in calling the Descent Checklist and went to level off at 16,000'. I noticed the yellow box was flashing around the altitude box. I became distracted with the flashing box and had shifted between ALT, STD and back to the ALT setting of 30.43. This, of course, changed the altimeter about four hundred feet every time I switched. I became confused at what was causing the yellow flashing box so I leveled off at 16,000' on altimeter 30.43, but was not positive I was at 16,000'.  I then noticed a 'ALT DISAGREE' and checked the First Officer's altimeter. It was at 29.43 not 30.43. I had him input 30.43. In the time we were trying to figure out the conflicting signals, I missed the Top of Descent point for the 11,000' crossing restriction. We then got the call from Center, 'You gonna make it at 11,000'' I started a Vertical Speed descent but was too late. We crossed at about 12,800'. Obviously, calling for the Descent Checklist passing FL 180 would have rectified this situation, but that one error quickly compounded into several issues at once.				A B737-700 Captain reported missing a crossing restriction after becoming confused by the altimeter display inaccuracy caused by the First Officer's altimeter setting being different from his.

Also, I noticed that aircraft were taking off on Runway XX so I initially programmed the FMC for a XX takeoff.  However, when I checked the ATIS, ZZZ was now taking off on YY but I never changed the FMC programming and, although I checked and briefed the departure, I didn't notice the initial heading was incorrect for a Runway YY departure (290 degrees versus 210 degrees).  I choose LNAV for the departure and was too late noticing the aircraft was over turning to a 290-degree heading.  Better crosscheck the FMC and better monitor the actual aircraft performance.		Despite briefing until we're blue in the face, somehow a heading that we've both flown a thousand times gets thrown out of our aviation brains due to too much focus on automation. I have no idea when LNAV was selected but it was and since the autopilot got turned on right after takeoff, the airplane started turning. Despite my feeling that something wasn't right, I didn't figure it out until ATC asked us if we were in the turn already. This is what drives me nuts about all this love affair with automation. No one's flying the airplane anymore.		A B737 crew failed to program the FMC for the correct departure runway so after takeoff when LNAV was selected the aircraft turned to the incorrect heading.

We requested a change in altitude or vectors to an area away from icing.  Due to high traffic volume, ATC delayed our request.  While holding, the #2 engine began to vibrate and reached a level of .9.  This was followed by what seemed to be a compressor stall which was probably the result of ice being ingested into the engine.  Shortly after this, the #1 engine began vibrating and reached a level of .7.  Before the situation could worsen, I declared an emergency to get out of holding and severe icing and to land ASAP.  The company and flight attendants were notified of the situation.  I told the Flight Attendants to prepare the cabin for a normal landing, but if the situation changes, I would advise them. A normal landing was made and the emergency was terminated.  After parking at the gate, a visual inspection of the engine showed large build-ups of ice on the engines.				A320 Captain experiences severe icing while holding at 14000 feet. Increasing engine vibration is indicated and felt as ice accumulates on the fan and possible compressor stalls occur as the ice is shed.  An emergency is declared to get out of icing and land quickly.

Upon turning off the wing anti-ice system the right wing anti-ice valve failed to close resulting in an ECAM message. No action was required and we determined that wing anti-ice was available and would need to be turned on for the approach, where icing conditions were reported, in order to prevent asymmetric deicing of the wings. This fault was a recurring write-up on this aircraft. The fault was reported to maintenance via ACARS and dispatch was contacted to clarify the 'thrust limit penalty' indicated on the ECAM. Shortly after resolving the above matter the ECAM indicated a BSCU 1 fault. Using the System Fault Reset section of the flight manual this fault was cleared and no further action was required. At gear extension on the approach to Runway X the BSCU 1 fault reoccurred along with an LGCIU 2 fault. A go-around was executed due to the loss of the #2 thrust reverser associated with the LGCIU 2 fault. Runway X was reported to have poor braking and to be contaminated with several inches of dry snow and we did not feel it appropriate to attempt a landing with the reverser inop.  We also needed time to trouble shoot the ECAM faults and to assess our options. The BSCU 1 fault and LGCIU 2 fault could not be resolved using either the System Fault Reset or Irregular procedure sections of the FM and were reported to maintenance via ACARS. Out of concern for possible deteriorating runway conditions, understanding the implications of any further failures and recognizing the onset of fatigue after an extraordinary work load while on duty more than 12 hours I declared an emergency with ATC. Dispatch was informed of this via ACARS message. The passengers and flight attendants were advised of our situation and the flight attendants were given a Cabin Advisory. We determined that a safe landing was possible on a runway of appropriate length with good braking action. Approach advised that Runway YR was open and met our criteria and we set up and briefed for the ILS to Y. Shortly after being vectored onto the localizer by ATC the localizer signal went off the air and we were forced to abandon this second approach. The localizer signal was restored a short time later and we were vectored back for another approach attempt. The approach was normal and we landed using medium auto-brakes and idle reverse on the left engine.				An A320 had a wing anti-ice valve fail open after takeoff then the BSCU and LGCIU ECAM alerted during approach. The BSCU reset but the LGCIU remained on and after two go arounds the fatigued crew declared an emergency and landed safely.

At cruise at FL340 we received numerous ECAM's in quick succession, in addition to a hydraulic blue system low pressure ECAM. With the First Officer flying I declared an emergency with ATC and told them we were having electrical issues with the aircraft. The First Officer continued to fly and he worked the radio as well, so I could run all the ECAM's/checklists/work with the cabin crew/Dispatch, etc. We were close to ZZZ (we were both familiar with the airport, we were VFR and could see the ZZZ area) the First Officer and I decided to divert to ZZZ based on the numerous failures that we currently had and additional failures that we were receiving, to include the Blue System Hydraulic failure. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to say we declared an emergency, we were having electrical and hydraulic issues and we were diverting to ZZZ. I then continued to run the ECAM's. While running the presented ECAM's, both my screens (Captain side) failed several times. The screens went blank for a few seconds, both came back and followed this pattern several times. In addition, the upper ECAM E/W screen failed several times with a white diagonal line across the screen. In reference to the bulletin regarding A319/320 electrical malfunctions, I immediately pulled up the electric page to both assess the electrical failures and determine what was causing the malfunctions. All indications on the electric page were normal, with no failures. In addition, during this time both the First Officer and I could hear a clicking sound (like a generator coming on and off line) on my side of the aircraft for several minutes. We also had the following failures: Air Pack 1 regulator fault, Anti-ice Left windshield fault, Anti-ice Left window fault, Nav GPWS fault, Nav GPWS Terr. DET fault, Hyd B System Lo Pressure ECAM, Pack 1 fault, Hyd B elec pump LO PR, Vent blower fault, Captain Pitot fault. The Captain side airspeed tape was erratic after the screens had come back on the Captain side. In addition, the Flight Attendant reported that the emergency exit lights came on above the exit doors and the lights in the cabin (overhead bin area) came on. I also lost electric power to my seat for a period of time. We were also unable to activate on the performance page for the arrival. The push button worked, but the airspeed bug would not move. This lasted for about 5 minutes. We were eventually able to get control of the airspeed indicator. We did find out after landing that the vent blower Circuit Breaker had popped. In addition to monitoring the electric ECAM page, we did monitor the HYD page for the blue system failure. We never received any ECAM's indicating a loss of a generator bus and/or any other electrical bus failures. All indications on the electric page remained within normal parameters. There was no galley power shed that would have occurred with a generator failure. We did begin the start for the APU for backup generator power if there was a loss of generator. We ran all the ECAM's, and additional ECAM's as presented. I gave the First Officer a status brief on the failures while he flew, after all ECAM's were complete. I briefed the flight attendants, telling them we were diverting, we would be landing in about 15 minutes, and at the time I did not need them to prep the cabin. With all the failures, the aircraft was handling normally.If we had received or we started to receive any flight control malfunctions or handling issues a cabin advisory and/or prep would have been issued. I told them I would give an announcement to the passengers. I completed the announcement to the passengers letting them know we were having some minor electrical issues (as they could see the lights in the cabin) and a minor hydraulic issue and we would be landing as a precaution. I ran the over weight check list, the approach descent checklist and did the landing performance based on the failures. We did ask Dispatch to run the numbers as well, unfortunately we were unable to get the data back as a check on our numbers. As the runway was almost 8,000 FT and dry, we were well within the landing performance data. These pieces of information would have been very helpful in reducing our workload, or any other information that could have been given to us to help with the diversion. Dispatch did ask our ETA, and while I understand that there is coordination going on, sending ACARS messages asking our ETA, when flight following is available to the Dispatcher and asking us below 10,000 FT what landing numbers we came up with is difficult for the crew at best. I understand that there was not much information for the Dispatcher to go with under this situation due to the multiple failures, and this is not for criticism, but pointed out as a learning tool as to the workload of the crew and what is reasonable for us to expect.During the descent, the ECAM's stopped and both screens on the Captain side as well as the upper ECAM screen stabilized and were operational and a normal approach (with all the remaining failures presented) and landing were accomplished. Since the electrical malfunctions seemed to stabilize, we did not elect to deselect either generator, possibly causing further failures as verification of generator loss as opposed to arcing was not certain at the time with the information presented. The First Officer did an excellent job flying while I coordinated all the checklists, communications, etc. He had the aircraft slowed and stabilized for the arrival. Due to the suspected arching issue, the situation stabilized, all the ECAM's and check lists completed, performance completed and cabin secured, we elected to continue the approach and not delay landing. In order to follow up and contact Maintenance Control we would have to delay landing and hold. Under the circumstances, we felt that could cause further risk of failure and continued arcing issues. We had an overweight landing, and touched down at 200 FPM (350 FPM max per the checklist) within the touchdown zone.In reference to the Bulletin: Airbus has alerted all operators of A320/A319 aircraft of two abnormal electrical conditions. The ECAM system may not annunciate the fault. Pilots are required to analyze and correct the malfunctions. The first malfunction is intermittent electrical power supply interruptions from Gen 1 or Gen 2. The cause can be IDG connector feeder arcing or a malfunctioning generator. The cockpit indications include flashing or blank cockpit displays on the one side of the cockpit, a flashing MCDU screen, intermittent flight control law reversions and uncommanded rudder trim inputs. Pilot actions should be to identify and deselect the malfunctioning generator. These failures seem to follow the above description in reference to the intermittent electrical power supply interruptions from Gen 1 or 2. We did have the blanking of both the Captain screens and the upper ECAM screen. We did try to analyze the situation on the electrical ECAM page, but all indications were presenting normally, we also used all other information presented to include the FOM. Without any indications on the electrical page of a malfunctioning  generator and/or other electrical bus failures directing the pilot to identify and deselect the malfunction generator is lacking in information and or direction for the crew, while dealing with a large number of failures.Having just gone through recurrent training on the Airbus, the demonstration of AC 1 bus failure as presented is significantly different then the failure we experienced. Thus, there is seemingly no training for this type of failure. In addition, below is the supplemental information. We suspected arcing. The failures were consistent with Gen 1, but not all the failures were present that a crew would expect to see or are listed on the Gen 1 Failure Checklist. We did not get MCDU1 failure or ADR 1 failure. While it can be suspected to be Gen 1, the check list calls for positive identification. Either there are other issues (as some of the failures we experienced can also be found on the AC essential bus) or the check list should read under identifying the affected generator: any or all of these failures can occur, allowing for positive identification of the generator. In addition, what is sustained flickering? We experienced the flickering for several minutes, enough to get through many of the ECAM's, but the system then stabilized. At this point, as referenced in the explanation above, we determined the most conservative action consistent with our diversion was to keep the configuration as is, in a stable operation. What is the guidance when the flickering is not sustained, but momentary or lasting several minutes?Electrical power supply interruption, electrical arcing in the IDG feeder cable at the pylon/nacelle connector can occur, causing power supply interruption that affects one or more generator electrical phases. Maintenance has determined that corrosion leads to the breakdown of the gold plating on the connector contacts, which in turn leads to pin arcing. Due to these type failures and number of other reported electrical failures in the Airbus fleet, will there be a required inspection on the IDG connectors for the feeder, so these types of failures can be mitigated before they occur? We did have more than 50% loss of displays, [so it became an] NTSB reportable issue.	Maintenance found that the electrical connections to the left generator had in fact been arcing and were burned.  Airbus has issued a bulletin concerning this phenomena.  Unfortunately this malfunction did not present exactly as described in the bulletin, making corrective action decisions difficult.			A320 Captain experiences electrical anomalies at FL340 and elects to divert. Anomalies included flickering flight displays on the Captain's side, along with the upper ECAM display. Numerous ECAM faults were displayed when the ECAM screen could be viewed.

(This was on its own with no Pilot input.) The First Officer was flying and he immediately caught the anomaly. He clicked the auto throttles off and maintained proper power to maintain proper airspeed. Since we were at Top of Descent I asked for lower and we started down. The First Officer selected Level Change but the aircraft appeared to not be complying with this command. (The 'B' autopilot was on.) He then went to Vertical Speed and started our descent with that command. Sometime during the descent, the IAS/MAS window showed a flashing 'O' (over speed) at a speed of 270 knots in the window. We needed to get down so he deployed the speed brake to keep the speed below 300 knots. We were nowhere near an over speed as indicated by all three Captain's, First Officer's and STBY Mach/Airspeed indicators. The flaps were in the proper position of ZERO, there were no lights on the overhead or FWD panel, and the handle was physically checked (numerous times) to verify it was seated properly. Somewhere around FL 180 the FMC and Mach Window returned to the normal settings for that phase of flight. On the ground I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and advised them and wrote up the airplane. The Maintenance Controller was puzzled, as were we, and he informed me that they would send us two Mechanics to try and troubleshoot the problem. He suspected it may have been a cold soaked flap sensor.				A B737-700 may have had a flap position sensor malfunction affecting autoflight IAS/MACH commands from the top of descent down to a lower altitude.

As the pilot not flying I announced, 'Traffic alert 2 o'clock, traffic in sight' and the Controller responded it was an aircraft with a clearance for the visual approach to Runway XXR. There was no admonition to maintain visual separation and the Controller's tone gave no indication his sequencing could potentially generate any further traffic conflict. The aircraft was above our altitude and we were descending on centerline and glideslope to the FAF. Passing approximately 7,200 FT MSL, we received a TCAS 'descend' RA. The company aircraft was 300 FT [above] and slightly ahead of us when the RA warning initiated. The pilot flying disengaged the autopilot [and] auto-throttles and began a descent below the glideslope, achieving a vertical separation of 600 FT. However, after approximately ten seconds of red RA 600 FT [above], it was obvious the traffic was not aiding vertical separation. Consequently, we corrected to the glideslope after the RA became inhibited below 900 FT AGL and continued the approach, landing uneventfully. At all times, we had the company aircraft in sight. Our response to this 'descend' RA was intentionally weak due to not wanting to get dangerously below glideslope and having no desire to trigger an EGPWS warning. The Tower was not informed of the RA event by us or the other aircraft.It was later determined the other aircraft received a 'monitor vertical speed' RA at the time we received our 'descend' RA, which explains why they did not go around. From a crew perspective, it is apparent [that] Approach Control does not believe they are often setting the stage for many of these TCAS RA events. Our recommendation would be to determine a way to mitigate future events by having a conference with the Controllers. Another thought is to implement a new crew procedure similar to the one used for Runways 28L/R in SFO, to position the transponder in TA at eight miles.				B737 Captain reports TCAS RA during visual approach to Runway XXL, generated by an aircraft on the visual to XXR. Initial attempts to comply with the RA are abandoned when the RA becomes inhibited at 900 FT AGL and a normal landing ensues.

The Captain advised me that a Flight Attendant witnessed a small 'puff' of smoke emitting from a light and there was no evidence of flame or additional smoke associated with it. The Flight Attendant then attempted to remove power from the light, and being unable to do so, she then made the decision to employ and discharge a quick shot of halon in the associated light socket. I had asked the Captain if any warnings, cautions, or smoke alarms were activated on the EICAS or the lower lobe crew rest facility. He stated that there were no indications of any sort. Additionally there was no evidence of smoke permeating into the cabin and none of the passengers in the area of the rest facility reported smoke to the flight attendants who were on duty.		The reading light in a B777's lower level crew rest area emitted a puff of smoke which a Flight Attendant then shot with halon. No fire or smoke sensors were activated.

While in the descent we were given a speed restriction of 280 KTS then 270 KTS, which we complied with. The Controller appeared to forget about us and by BARET Intersection we were still at 12,000 FT and had to request a lower altitude. The Controller was obviously overloaded and with the great visibility that we had we called the field in sight so as to be cleared for the visual approach. The Controller gave us a clearance direct to VYDDA, descend to 6,000 FT and cleared for the visual approach to Runway 27. Prior to reaching VYDDA, the Controller canceled our clearance and gave us a turn to 180 degrees. [The Controller] then gave us a turn to 240 degrees while still level at 6,000 FT south of OKAIN. While in the turn to 240 degrees, another Controller came on and gave us a further turn to 350 degrees with the following exchange: Controller: Air Carrier X turn right to 350 degrees. Air Carrier X: We are currently in the turn to 350 degrees. Controller: Air Carrier X I need you to turn right immediately to 350 deg. Air Carrier X: We are in the turn to 350 degrees. Controller: Air Carrier X you have parachute jumping activity at 12 o'clock, ? mile at 10,500 FT. Air Carrier X: We are looking for the traffic. We never saw the traffic that was over 4,000 FT above us and no TCAS warning was received. The Controller did not say anything else after that other than to once again clear us for the visual approach. No explanation, no apology, no nothing. The Controller seemed upset that we were in the airspace that another Controller had vectored us into. I made a comment on the radio that this was the worst controlling I had ever seen and received no response whatsoever. This was obviously a close call with traffic that we knew nothing about. No warning about parachute jumping in the vicinity of our location, no traffic call out other than as a last minute evasive maneuver, no explanation, no nothing. The impression we got was that Controller training was in progress and the instructor took over at the last minute. The airspace we entered was exactly where the Controller vectored us into and the close call was certainly not of our doing.				Air Carrier operating with SCT, reportedly was vectored into a potential conflict with a parachute operation with no prior notification, the reporter suspecting controller training was in progress.

We were level at FL 390 at .77M/246 KIAS. Aircraft rapidly accelerated through VMO/MMO by approximately 12 KIAS for 5-7 seconds. Thrust levers were retarded and speed brakes carefully deployed to arrest acceleration. Additionally, aircraft gained almost 500 FT in altitude. The autopilot had been engaged when the event occurred.				When a B737-800 encountered a mountain wave at FL390 the airspeed exceeded VMO/MMO by 12 knots for 5-7 seconds and the aircraft climbed nearly 500 FT so the aircraft thrust levers were retarded while the speed brakes were extended.

The Hi-Loks mounting the repair plate extended out over the TOGA button. The repair should, in my opinion, be done with flush rivets to allow unrestricted access to the TOGA button. If the engineering authorization is to be the standard then the TOGA button for that throttle should be placed on MEL. At a DH (Decision Height) of 50 FT safety is compromised if the pilot can't find the TOGA button in a standardized manner. The aircraft was accepted by the Captain after talking to Maintenance Control and shown the Engineering Authorization stating that it was within 'Compliance'. Several maintenance techs that I talked with regarding this issue all agreed that the repair should be done with flush rivets or MEL the TOGA button. The reason given that it was not done with flush rivets was 'Time'. I submit that 'Safety' should take precedence over 'Time'.				A B737-700 had an authorized engineering change repair to a cracked thrust lever that allowed protruding rivets that impeded clear access to the TOGA button which may be needed during a critical moment of a missed approach.

After contacting me I directed her to turn off all electric equipment in the galley and let me know if the smell went away. She called back and informed me that the #2 coffee maker circuit breaker had popped out and the smell had subsided. I called the Dispatcher and Maintenance to let them know what was going on. We discussed the possibility of a divert if the situation changed at all for the worse. The Flight Attendant monitored the area for about 5 minutes before calling me again to inform me that now the smell had returned, the panel was getting hot again and the T/R circuit breaker had just tripped out also. After a few more minutes she said the smell was going away and the temperature was cooling down. At that time we felt that it would be prudent to get the aircraft on the ground to get the electric system checked out before going any further. We were about 150 miles west of [a suitable airport] when we decided to divert as a precaution. We informed Dispatch and ATC. We had a Flight Attendant remain in the galley to inform us of any changes. There was no smoke or flames or any unusual ECAMs or indications in the cockpit that we noticed. We landed about 15-20 minutes after the decision was made to divert.				An A320 Flight Attendant notified the pilots of a burning plastic smell in the aft galley which dissipated when the coffee makers were turned off. Later a T/R circuit breaker popped with more electrical smell so the crew diverted to an enroute airport.

ECAM LG (Landing Gear) not uplocked occurred. We also felt the nose gear strut settle onto the gear doors. We discussed fuel burn (4,000 LBS/HR) and determined we could continue to destination at this cruise state and arrive with approximately 5,000 LBS. Discussed possible 'nose gear cocked' scenario and reviewed landing technique and flare for nose gear problems. Decided to extend gear on base leg to final to assess gear situation. First Officer flew visual approach and landing. Safe gear indication, safe landing.		Climbing through approximately FL200 we heard and felt a thump from beneath our legs and then saw on the center instrument panel a red UNLK light illuminate. A few moments later we had an ECAM and overspeed warning horn sound at which time ECAM instructed us to slow below 220 KTS. At the time we were doing about 280 KTS in the climb. We slowed and leveled of at FL250 after requesting with ATC. ATC asked us if we needed assistance at which time we were still trying to figure out our situation. We looked at the resulting status page and saw that we had 'LG Gear Not Uplocked' displayed. The Flight Manual told us to recycle the gear. We chose not to since we were concerned that if we brought the gear back up we may make things worse and possibly not be able to extend the gear when needed. We also knew that if we extended the gear at that time we wouldn't have enough fuel to make our destination. The weather was excellent all the way to our destination and we had many airports along our path so we new at anytime we could land quickly if needed. Fortunately the Captain had added fuel for our trip and after discussing our situation with Dispatch and Maintenance it was agreed that it was safe to continue to our destination. The Flight Attendants were advised of the situation and given a cabin advisory. Dispatch informed us that Tower and emergency services would be advised of our situation. Also we explained our situation to enroute ATC and told them that we did not need any assistance and requested a speed of 220 KTS to destination. After that it was a slow quiet ride. On base we lowered the gear and with out any incident proceeded to land. After landing we taxied off the active runway and the Fire Department inspected the nose gear and gave us the go ahead to continue to the gate.		A320 flight crew experiences a nose gear uplock failure climbing through FL200. Nose gear doors remain closed but aircraft is slowed to 220 KTS to comply with overspeed warning and ECAM logic. After consultation with Maintenance the crew elects to continue to destination at reduced speed. Nose gear extends normally.

Auto pilot and auto thrust disengaged.  We received a subsequent ECAM message for AC BUS 1 FAULT.  I was the flying pilot and after auto pilot was re engaged and navigation was checked, I transferred control of the aircraft to the pilot not flying and completed the ECAM, followed up with the QRH.  There is not a specific checklist for AC BUS 1 FAULT so I consulted the handbook and we discussed our plan with the faults that we had.  Contacted Dispatch with the radio since ACARS was inoperative.  We lost control of the cabin temperature and one point had -20 degree air coming into the aircraft.  Made the decision to descend and divert to the nearest suitable airport.  Informed Dispatch but never talked to Maintenance Control.  Lost radio contact once we started our decent.  I declared and emergency with ATC, then informed the Flight Attendants.  [I] informed them to get the cabin ready for a precautionary landing.  Noise Wheel Steering was one of the faults we had so I informed them that we would have to be towed off the runway.  Instructed them to make an initial cabin announcement about our diversion and that I would brief the passengers when I had time.  First Officer made a excellent normal approach and landing.  We stopped on the runway.  Shut down the engines and at that point, the emergency crew checked out the aircraft.  They gave us the OK to be towed to the gate.	ECAM procedures directed that the number 1 generator be reset and if unsuccessful that it be turned off, which was accomplished.  Examination of the ECAM electrical page showed that the ESS AC bus had automatically transfered to AC Bus 2.  AC Bus 1 remained unpowered and the APU was started with the hope that its' generator would pick up AC Bus 1, but that too was unsuccessful.  The mechanic who was assigned to fix the aircraft at the divert airport was familiar with the issue and the aircraft was ferried without any further electrical problems.			A320 Captain experiences an AC BUS 1 FAULT at FL340 which cannot be corrected by QRH or ECAM procedures.  The crew elects to divert to the nearest suitable airport.  Nose wheel steering was among the faults annunciated and the aircraft had to be towed to the gate after landing.

Outside the final approach fix with the flaps selected to 15 and the gear down I noticed a slight split in the flap position indicator needles; the left flap needle indicated approximately 15 and the right somewhere between 12 and 13. This airplane had a write-up some 4 to 5 days earlier regarding an asymmetrical flap problem. I called to the attention of the First Officer the slight split and advised him to watch carefully when we selected flaps 25 to see if they responded normally. When 25 was selected the flaps didn't move, he immediately put the handle back to flaps 15. By that time we were talking to Tower. I felt I needed time to sort through the various issues and checklists associated with jammed and asymmetrical flaps so I asked the First Officer to advise Tower that we were executing a go-around. The Tower told us to climb straight ahead to 3,000 and then eventually to 4,000. Tower switched us over to Departure Control and they asked us about our intentions. I told them we were declaring an emergency, wanted vectors to the south and an ILS to YY (I wanted the longer runway). I turned the aircraft over to the First Officer found the appropriate checklist in the QRH and methodically completed the QRH checklist. I then called the Flight Attendants, briefed them on our situation, gave them the emergency items and asked them to do their '30 second' reviews. After briefing the Flight Attendants I made a PA explaining to the passengers basically that: The reason we made a go-around was due to a mechanical problem with the aircraft that didn't allow us to use normal landing flap settings. For that reason we would land on a different runway. While on downwind, I resumed control of the aircraft, the First Officer set up the ILS to 28 and we completed the normal landing checklist. Per the QRH, the flap handle was selected to 10, the flap inhibit switch was selected, and the Vref was adjusted up to 160 KTS. I asked the First Officer to call Company Operations and advise them of our emergency status and have them call Dispatch. He tried three times on the company frequency and couldn't get through so I told him to disregard. The landing was uneventful, the Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighting equipment followed us for a short while, and we taxied to the gate. Both the First Officer and I are new to this aircraft. I have approximately 100 hrs and he 200 hrs of 737 time.		On approach the Captain noticed a slight flap asymmetry. The aircraft was configured with gear down and the flaps 15. The flap asymmetry was barely perceptible so the approach was continued with a brief for a possible go-around if the flap condition deteriorated. Captain called for flaps 25 and the flaps did not move. The flap handle was reselected to 15 and a go-around was accomplished.		A B737-800 crews describes the events following a trailing edge flap asymmetry indication received on final. An emergency was declared.

First Officer goes through checklist and it resets initially but immediately trips again. All other indications are normal. Turned Left Pack OFF per QRH. I call Dispatch to evaluate avoiding icing conditions at destination. I level at FL330 vice FL390. Dispatch had no options- so I return to departure airport. Twice ATC asks if we are emergency and I say no; normal return. At FL240 on vectors, we hear the intermittent horn. We feel no ears popping or any change in pressure. I look up and see 8,000 FT on cabin altitude and 5 diff pressure. I push the power up to no affect. We look around for anything abnormal. First Officer checks duct pressure 40 PSI, all normal. First Officer manually closes outflow valve. I see 4 diff pressure and 10,000 cabin altitude; we start emergency descent procedure. First Officer declares Emergency with ATC and requests 10,000 FT. ATC responds descend to 17,000 FT, traffic below. First Officer says we are an emergency get them out of our way. (I'm wondering just how close the traffic is. I look at TCAS and see no one close.) I immediately step in with, declaring an emergency, cabin is depressurized, and we are descending to 10,000 FT. ATC clears us to 10,000 FT. ATC is very cooperative rest of way to landing. Cabin altitude read 10,000 FT when we leveled at 10,000. We could hear and feel the relief doors cycling. Thus at that point, I believe the cabin pressure read accurately. At one point, the diff needle blocked the cabin altitude needle at a critical time. These old dual round gages need to go away.				B737-800 Captain reports being dispatched in an aircraft which had recently been written up for a left bleed trip. During initial climb the problem reoccurs twice and the bleed valve is closed and the left pack turned off. The decision is made to return to departure airport due to destination weather and at FL240 the cabin altitude warning horn sounds and an emergency descent is commenced. A normal landing ensues.

I called Tower upon landing and the problem had occurred previously but not to the extent our aircraft experienced.I was told that the close proximity of a taxiway to the glideslope antennae with passage of a wide body could cause the problem and a B747 was maneuvering in described area at time of event.				An A320 captured a false and/or corrupt glideslope signal and descended at an excessive rate causing a flap overspeed.

While climbing at about 4,000 FT per minute going through 9,000 FT, ATC advised us of the traffic again and suggested we level off at 9,500 FT if traffic not in sight. We immediately saw the traffic and simultaneously got a 'descend' RA which we immediately responded to. We overshot 9,500 FT slightly (about 200 FT) as we responded to the RA but had the traffic in sight. The RA lasted for about 10 seconds. When clear of the conflict we continued our climb to our assigned altitude of 13,000 FT as the other aircraft passed well behind us (approximately 1/2 mile). The TCAS system worked as designed and the flight continued uneventfully.ATC [was] a little late with the traffic callout. [The] crew [was] unable to make visual contact earlier. The simultaneous suggestion (it was only a suggestion) that we level off at 9,500 FT from ATC just as we made visual contact with the traffic and the activation of the 'descend' RA all occurred at the same time. The TCAS system worked as designed and we responded to it appropriately.				B737 Captain passing 8,000 FT during climb is advised of VFR traffic at one o'clock at 10,500 FT. ATC suggests level off at the same time TCAS RA commands a descent and visual acquisition is made. A level off at 9,500 FT is made before resuming climb to 13,000 FT.

She called back up and informed me that the coffee maker Circuit Breaker (CB) had popped and the smell was going away.I called Dispatch for a phone patch to Maintenance Control to let them know what was going on.  We discussed the possibility of a divert if the situation changed at all for the worse.  The Flight Attendant monitored the area for about 5 minutes and then called back and said that the smell was coming back and the panel was again getting very hot.  Shortly after that she told me that a T/R CB had just popped also.  At that time we felt that it would be prudent to get the aircraft on the ground to get it inspected for possible damage to the electrical system.  We told Dispatch and ATC we were going to divert to ZZZ as a precaution.  The galley never had any smoke and we never had any unusual ECAMs in the cockpit.  We landed and taxied to the gate.

No flight attendants, no passengers. On climbout through approximately 13,000 FT, the cabin altitude warning sounded. After performing the immediate action items, I leveled the aircraft off just below 14,000 FT and requested a descent to 10,000 with ATC. ATC immediately issued this clearance, so I felt it unnecessary to declare an emergency. After leveling at 10,000 FT, we ran the QRH checklist. We double checked that both the bleeds and packs were on, which they were. We changed the pressurization controller to Manual and closed the outflow valve. The pressurization seemed to be coming under control. Once we had established a 1,000 FPM cabin descent, we were confident we could maintain pressurization control manually, so we requested a climb to our cruise altitude of 30,000. We were cleared to climb. Again out of 13,000 the altitude warning horn sounded and we again donned our O2 masks. We descended again to 10,000 and remained at 10,000 throughout the duration of the flight. The remainder of the flight was uneventful, and we landed without incident. With the outflow valve full closed and both packs showing good pressure, we were unable to control the pressurization of the aircraft. It was as if a door was open or a window had blown out. One way or the other we were expecting to find a large hole somewhere on the aircraft.Probable mechanical failure or snow packed into the outflow valve. There was a strong wind blowing drifting snow in the direction of our outflow valve as we sat at the international gate at the departure airport. Other interesting things which happened during this event include our inability to contact dispatch via radio (we tried both frequencies) nor ACARS. ACARS was NO COMM. Possibly this is because we were only at 10,000 feet. Nevertheless, we were pretty much on our own with the decision to continue rather than turn back. We decided continuing was a safer option, as the winter storm we were trying to escape from was just bearing down on the departure airport, and the FMS was showing us landing with 8,000 LBS of fuel after setting the cruise altitude to 10,000 in the FMC.	The reporter states that the problem was caused by a faulty main cabin door and that this aircraft had a history of these occurrences. When the door was closed, it was noted that the latching handle required extra effort to move through the last few inches of travel. Apparently a flap on the lower portion of the door was not being sequenced properly when the door was latched even though no door warnings were observed.			B737-700 Captain reports cabin altitude warning horn climbing through 13,000 FT on a ferry flight. Packs and bleeds are verified on and the outflow valve is manually positioned toward closed. When the climb is resumed the cabin warning again sounds and the crew continues to destination at 10,000 FT.

We had the amber Auto Fail and the green Altitude lights on. We started the QRH procedure A-11. Just as I was finishing the QRH procedure, the green Altitude light went out and the amber Auto Fail light re-illuminated and the cabin altitude started to rise rapidly. In a matter of a second or two, the Cabin Altitude horn sounded and we both completed the memory items for this procedure and I started the QRH procedure. While [we were] in manual pressurization with the outflow valve closed, the cabin was still losing pressure but at a much slower rate. We then declared an emergency and diverted.	The reporter stated that first indication of a failure was the Master Caution and the accompanying AUTO FAIL light. With the AUTO FAIL annunciation the standby controller was automatically selected. The reason for selecting the AUTO FAIL switch was to get the system indication to agree with what the actual system configuration. After the second controller failed the reporter was doing the last part of the QRH checklist and attempted to manually ensure the outflow valve was closed because the cabin climb rate had slowed but was still increasing. At that point the Pressurization Control Panel had lost all power and nothing on it worked. The first phase of the failure, AUTO FAIL/STANDBY took about 30 seconds. The next phase in manual until the cabin stopped climbing was about another 30 seconds. So the entire event, cabin at 8,000 FT to cabin at 14,000 FT took about a minute. The cabin did stop at 14,000 FT and the crew was in a rapid emergency descent at that point from 40,000 FT to 10,000 FT. The cabin O2 masks did not drop.			A B737-700's pressurization control panel failed completely at FL400. An emergency was declared, the QRH procedure completed, an emergency descent begun and the cabin stopped at 14,000 FT. The flight diverted to an enroute airport.

We were in contact with Mexico Center and were told to maintain FL330 and contact Mexico Approach. We checked in with Mexico Approach at FL330 and were told by approach to maintain FL330 and expect the Kobek 1B arrival. After a few minutes the Captain and I began to feel like we were too high for our proximity to the airport and position on the approach. We were now inside QET and outside of Kobek. We were about to query Mexico Approach about our altitude when Mexico Approach called us and asked us what our altitude was. We told them FL330 assigned. The Controller responded by saying, 'Negative. You should be descending to 13,000 FT. Turn to heading 090, descend to 13,000 and intercept the SLM VOR 360 radial inbound to SLM.' We followed these new instructions, but asked ATC to verify if we had missed a previous clearance to 13,000. It took 3 attempts to finally understand what the Controller was trying to say which was that he had cleared us to descend via the Kobek 1B arrival when we first checked in. Neither the Captain nor I recall receiving this clearance. We intercepted the SLM VOR 360 radial as instructed and resumed the arrival and ILS DME 2 for Runway 23L and landed without incident. In addition to the communication barrier, the Captain and I were dealing with possible windshear and moderate turbulence reports on the arrival and approach into Mexico City. We are both aware of the challenges of flying into MMMX and had fully briefed many things to expect. As I write this report it is my recollection that no descent to 13,000 was given. I will take from this experience the need to be even more cognizant of potential communication miscues especially as we get closer to the airport and arrival fixes and on initial check-in with approach.		It was a very high workload environment due to language barriers, turbulence, and Runway 23 in use.		An A320 on approach MMMX was told to expect the KOBEL 1B arrival but was never cleared to descend from FL330 until after QET. A descent clearance was issued off track when the Controller realized what happened.

No positive control of movement of flaps that are left down for ice inspection. While I was doing walk around inspection (flaps left down by inbound crew), Maintenance (who had refilled system B hydraulics) directed my First Officer (who just arrived at aircraft) to raise the flaps. First Officer asked 'are the flaps clear (of ice)?' Maintenance said 'flaps are clear (no movement hazard or hydraulics is serviced?)' 2. No way to tell outbound crew the results of the flap inspection the inbound crew requested (done by ramp).3. Maintenance can't always see flap damage until the flaps are de-iced (ice from landing rollout back spray from wheels).4. There is no provision for maintenance to inspect for damage at the de-ice pad. No de-icing at gate.5. Condition of runway was not as reported by tower using local personnel input. We encountered 2 strong jolts at 110 and 120 KTS. I thought the right gear, First Officer thought nose gear. The next day we found 2 dents on left horizontal stab at mid-span leading edge directly behind left engine. Airport had just plowed the runway due to 'rough' report by departing pilot. I saw no plow debris as he plowed the first 2,000 FT, but could not see his plowing further down the runway. I strongly recommend some data on how thick the packed ice is, and a line/management pilot drive the runway and get out and examine the runway/ice closely.  Had I been able to see the runway from the gate, I would have demanded to drive out for an inspection as I did years ago at DCA.6. All stations should have bright lights/flashlights for post flight inspections on dark ramps, especially at international destinations in Latin America. Crews can't carry big flashlights any more.				B737 Captain laments lack of procedures by maintenance to properly inspect an aircraft after it has landed on an icy runway and taxied to the gate with the flaps down. Damage to the horizontal stabilizer is discovered the next day.

A clearance was given to intercept the SFO 095 radial after OOMEN. We had built way points corresponding to the 18/13/6 DME fixes on the visual arrival and continued with LNAV engaged. Approach Control called traffic (another carrier's heavy) coming from left on the TIP TOE visual, which we acknowledged. We were assigned 180 KTS from 210 KTS. The First Officer had the SFO raw data VOR to confirm our position. Between 18 and 13 DME, I noticed the other carrier's heavy taking a cut away from us. We continued to configure for landing on 28R. Approaching the San Mateo Bridge, we were still in a close abeam position and the lateral separation was closing. Approaching 1,200 FT AGL, the First Officer called the Tower and said, 'Confirm the heavy is going to the left.' The heavy initiated a go-around and we continue to land. We estimated the lateral separation to be 800 to 1,000 FT. I called the SFO Tower Supervisor and discussed the event. He seemed unconcerned.According to the SFO expanded charted visual procedures there should be 1/8 to 1/4 mile stagger between aircraft on visual approaches. Either Approach or the Tower failed to establish the proper stagger. I was reluctant to slow behind the heavy due to possible wake turbulence issues.		We were flying into SFO on the QUIET BRIDGE VISUAL approach for Runway 28L and R. I was the pilot not flying and working the radios. NCT told us to comply with the charted visual approach for Runway 28 right. We were inside of 13 miles to the field when they notified us that a heavy Airbus would be on a parallel visual approach to Runway 28L and to maintain visual separation from the heavy Airbus. As we continued on the approach, the Captain and I kept visual contact with the Airbus. At eight miles, I selected TA on the transponder in accordance with company procedures for SFO. At six miles from SFO and over the bridge on the charted visual procedure, the Captain was still north of the extended centerline getting ready to intercept the final.We were transferred to the Tower frequency, checked in, and received landing clearance. We both noticed that the Airbus looked as if it was getting closer, but then it appeared to make a correction away from our course. Both aircraft were exactly abeam one another. The TCAS then made a 'traffic' call, and we noticed that the Airbus was now banking back to north of the course for 28L and getting closer. Consequently, the Captain maneuvered north of course, as we were already displaced significantly north of the centerline for Runway 28R. I made a radio call to the Tower and said, 'Confirm the heavy Airbus is landing on Runway 28L.' There was a pause and at this point the Airbus executed a go-around, and the Tower confirmed our landing clearance on Runway 28R. The Airbus was approximately 500 FT from us laterally when it executed the go-around. We continued to the runway and landed uneventfully. One contributing factor was that both aircraft were exactly abeam one another on the approach, making range and closure judgments harder to see at night while trying to align with Runway 28R. The other factor was that the other carrier tried to land on the wrong runway.		B737 flight crew describes a conflict with a heavy Airbus on short final during simultaneous visual approaches to Runways 28L and R. The Airbus crew either mistook or misunderstood the clearance to Runway 28L and attempted to line up on Runway 28R, before going around when the error is discovered.

The surface winds were a crosswind from right to left, but the winds at altitude were left to right, which must have kept the B747's jet wash lingering in our approach path.  I flew slightly high, but still encountered the turbulence at about 15 miles at about 4,500 FT.  I believe we were at flaps 5 slowing to 170 KTS per ATC.  We rolled abruptly to the left, but only about 20 degrees before the autopilot was disengaged.  The remainder of the approach was flown by hand, slightly steep (1/2 dot or so) until about 1,000 FT AGL.  As we were below 10,000 FT in a sterile cockpit, I did not make a PA.  We landed without incident and turned off at the reverse and immediately crossed 24L per the Tower.  The taxi was short and very congested and, again, I did not stop the aircraft to make a PA.  Once safely parked at our gate, I made myself available at the front of the aircraft to answer customer questions.  There were a few, but no one seemed overly agitated or alarmed.  [It's] nearly impossible to consistently predict where jet wash will be encountered, even if protective measures are taken, as we did.  Next time, I may elect to go-around.  This is the first time SoCal Approach has placed a B747 across my final at LAX (probably with good intentions on their part).				A B737-700 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence from a preceding B747 on a parallel runway at LAX.

After a normal approach and very smooth touchdown by my First Officer, I thought he got on the brakes very quickly. I was about to say something when we got an ECAM BRAKES AUTO BRK FAULT, shortly followed by another ECAM BRAKES SYS 2 FAULT; the rest of the rollout was normal, albeit with some vibration that disappeared as we slowed down. I took control of the aircraft, further slowed and felt that braking and turning seemed normal so I carefully made the second high speed turn-off and proceeded slowly to the ramp. While taxiing, I continued to evaluate the brakes and steering; steering was completely normal and the brakes seemed spongy, but had no problem slowing and stopping the aircraft. Brake temperatures were normal. Because of the ECAM's and sponginess, I had my First Officer request a tow-in to the gate. (As we entered the ramp, I noticed that the brake temps on two and four were increasing normally, but one and three were cold.) The tug driver advised we had two blown tires, number one and three mains. Maintenance met us and I advised the Mechanic of the sequence of events. The maintenance post flight report showed the ECAM's and a series of system failures; apparently it was the number one wheel tachometer that failed as that was replaced overnight (along with the tires) and the airplane was returned to service.	This event was the first of two brake failure events the reporter experienced in one month.  The second event did not result in any blown tires.			An A320 Captain experienced an auto brake fault on landing although auto brakes were not selected.  Upon arrival at the gate two flat tires were discovered.

Runway 32L T-10 opened and we were assigned this with our taxi clearance. I quickly sent a 1/4 inch slush correction request to Dispatch via ACARS just before taxiing. Taxi out was unusual as we were behind the seven-truck plow team on Alpha. Only the right half of the taxiway was plowed 2-3 inches of snow on the left half (distraction). Shortly after liftoff I had the epiphany that I screwed up and had requested 32L and not 32LX (T-10) with Dispatch. They would have no way of knowing. Had we lost an engine I can only imagine what the outcome might have been. Not to distract from the seriousness of this situation I do want to expand on the human factor side of this; again, not to make excuses but to explain the pitfalls of a sequence such as ours. I woke this morning at XA:30 am so as to make a XD:05 sign in. We had one simple leg to ORD then a scheduled 10:35 layover followed by this flight scheduled to land at XU:25L which equates to 02:25 body time. On this layover, other than 30 minutes on the treadmill I was a hermit in my room. I slept from roughly XL:00 pm to XF:00 pm ORD time. Our flight was delayed two hours due to inbound equipment. [We were] now departing at XU:00L which is 00:00 body time; so while the sequence 'appears' to provide 10 plus hours to reset our body clocks, and despite my best efforts at minimal caffeine, proper diet, exercise and sleep I actually pushed back from the gate in ORD with 3 hours sleep in the previous 20 hours. Landing at XW:30 local time equates to 3 hours sleep in the previous 25 hours. Fatigued? Not apparent at departure, actually felt energized. Clearly I wasn't firing on all cylinders to make a rookie mistake like I did. My point is that we should not build a sequence like this expecting a pilot to recognize his situation and remove him/herself from the trip. Those warning signs may not be apparent at that stage until it is too late. We should proactively protect our crews. At the hotel I called Dispatch to try and get another aircraft but none were available. When Tracking called I voiced my concerns about the time of day and was told 'to hang in there...you can do it Captain.' I try to be a team player, tried to hang in there (as I mentioned, actually felt good). Clearly the results are not what we would consider sterling. We go out of our way to regulate and monitor safety (i.e., landing flaps by 1,000 FT -not 950 FT- and still 3.3 miles from touchdown) but allow sequences to be built that on paper look good yet have no grasp of human physiology. We want to be aggressively safe yet ask our aging pilot force to perform in unsafe circumstances. And while the mid-sequence fatigue policy can be an excellent tool, clearly the triggers were not apparent until the damage had been done last night. Sorry for being verbose. However this is the kind of scenario the safety team should examine. The outcome could have been terrible.		After takeoff we realized we had requested and applied a slush correction for Runway 32L instead of our assigned 32LX. We had planned to takeoff from Runway 28. Runway conditions turned out to be better than expected and the takeoff was uneventful.		B737-800 flight crew fails to advise Dispatch of a takeoff from Runway 32L at T10.  Numbers provided were for Runway 32L full length, takeoff was normal and pilot fatigue cited as a contributing factor.

A pin was left in the spoiler on the right side of the aircraft during wash and was not removed. It was not caught by the flight crew or ground crew before takeoff. This resulted in a [air] return event without incident. There should be some sort of cockpit notice (sign off in the logbook) anytime a flight control is pinned. There are many distractions on that side of the aircraft during the walkaround. I don't want to make excuses. I consider myself very aware of my surroundings when doing a walkaround and always try to get a good look at the whole aircraft.		Two pilots, two Mechanics and one Inspector report about a # 9-Spoiler Lock that was not removed from a B737-700 aircraft before departure that later required an air turnback due to vibrations after take-off. The spoiler was locked in the 'UP' position.

Dispatch and I both asked what section of the MEL we were under.  They said the first one.  I am giving you this information for information purposes.  We did not declare an emergency.  I landed the flight with the gear problem.		On our previous flight at approximately 10,000 FT MSL on descent, we received an Intermittent Configuration/Cabin Altitude Warning horn.  We accomplished the appropriate QRH checklist and landed.  On landing, we got the PSEU Warning light.  When we got to the gate, the Captain wrote the discrepancy in the logbook and Maintenance came to the airplane.  The Captain spoke with Dispatch and Maintenance, and we received a MEL for the airplane so we could continue. On takeoff for our next flight, the landing gear would not come up.  We continued to climb up to 8000' MSL and ran the appropriate QRH checklist.  We informed ATC that we would need to return  because of a Maintenance problem.  ATC asked if we needed any assistance and we said no.  After completing the QRH and all other checklists, we informed our Flight Attendants, Company Operations, and our Passengers that we would be returning . On landing, we received the PSEU Warning light again. The Captain wrote the discrepancy in the aircraft logbook upon arrival at the gate.		B737-700 flight crew experienced an intermittent takeoff/cabin altitude warning horn during descent for landing.  After landing the PSEU [Proximity Switch Electronic Unit] warning light is illuminated and is subsequently MEL'ed by Maintenance.  On the next takeoff the gear will not retract.

Center told us to maintain 320 KTS so we started down at 320 KTS. Flight Attendant's dinged the cockpit, First Officer said 'I'm off #1.' I said 'I've got it.' MEM Center gave us ATL Center frequency change. I contacted ATL Center. Controller gave me 'cross HONIE at 12,000 and 250 KTS. I put it in the FMS. Aircraft was in VNAV on decent profile at 320 KTS to cross HONIE at 12,000/250. All [was] good. As First Officer checked back in with me we hit some moderate turbulence, I started to slow the aircraft to 310, then 300 KTS for the chop. I told him to tell ATC we had to slow for the chop. He complied and ATC said, 'No problem, let him know if we needed to slow more.' I put the speed-brakes out to try to stay on profile. ATC handed us off to ATL Approach; this is all happening at once, the turbulence, the First Officer checking back in, the frequency change, getting the seatbelt sign back on, etc. First ATL Approach Controller says turn left heading 010, expect ILS 9R. We turn to new heading and Approach Controller says 'were you given a crossing restriction?' We were passing 12,500 at the time. I told First Officer 'tell him HONIE 12/250' First Officer complied. Controller said you're a bit inside that. First Officer looked at me and said 'did I miss something?' I laughed and said 'not really we just haven't had time to tell them we were going to have trouble hitting the fix since we slowed down, and got the handoff.' That was it. Honestly, there are just some things that do happen that are somewhat beyond our control. Hitting the turbulence at the exact same time First Officer is checking back with me and was getting a handoff. I have to admit I had my hands full of airplane, my mouth full of radio, my finger on the seat-belt sign switch, and the First Officer checking back in. Yep, I was task saturated. And it all happened in as much time as it took to read this last paragraph. I probably could have given the plane to the First Officer and taken the time to explain to the Controller what all had happened in the last two minutes, but at that point I felt it more prudent just to shut-up and continue the flight. If he really needed to know I'm sure there'd be a phone number waiting for me on the ground.				B737 Captain describes events leading up to missing a crossing restriction during descent.

The Captain notified the Flight Attendants to remain seated and the First Officer notified the Tower we were still on the runway. We exited runway and requested a gate return.We brought the aircraft to a stop abeam the gate suspecting tire damage. We then contacted Operations for airstairs to deplane the passengers. The hottest brake temperatures observed were 885 on the left side and 885 on the right side.				An A320-200 flight crew rejected their takeoff at 80 KTS upon receipt of an ECAM 'HOT BRAKES DELAY TAKEOFF' message.

At approximately 90 KTS, the Tower said, '(Company flight number), cancel takeoff clearance.' Another aircraft which was waiting for takeoff clearance on 19R transmitted something (frequency congestion). The Captain asked the Tower to confirm the takeoff clearance. The Tower replied, 'Continue with takeoff.' We continued the takeoff normally. After rotation, we noticed an Airbus had either departed or initiated a go-around from 25L. We crossed under the flight path of the Airbus by approximately 1000 FT. We did not receive a TCAS alert. We do not believe there was a loss of separation.		The LAS Tower cleared us for takeoff on Runway 19L. Passing 95 KTS, the Tower sounded like they said for us to cancel our takeoff clearance. Being a full flight and passing 95 KTS, I was not sure of their instructions and another aircraft started talking. At that point, I did not see any reason to abort at such a high speed. Afterward, I asked what they wanted us to do and the Tower replied to continue our takeoff. Another aircraft on 25L apparently went missed approach. The flight continued and separation was maintained by both aircraft and ATC. The flight was completed without further incident.		Air Carrier departure from LAS described a confused takeoff cancellation instruction from the Tower after reaching 95 knots, the reporter indicating the Tower's clearance was less than clear.

Passing 8,000 FT the Captain and I noticed a Land ASAP (Amber) Memo. There had been no ECAM warning or caution associated with this ECAM Memo. The Captain selected the RCL (recall) button to see if there were any items displayed. Sure enough, there was an Avionics Smoke procedure displayed. There was no perceptible smoke. We asked the Flight Attendants if any indication of smoke in the cabin, and there was none. Both the Captain and I were suspect of this problem, because there didn't appear to be any direct confirmation of the smoke. In addition, the lack of any other ECAM warning or caution made us somewhat suspect of the Land ASAP Memo. The Captain sent a four page ACARS message describing the problem to Maintenance. We also referenced the Flight Manual for further guidance with this particular issue. After further thought, the Captain decided for a return to our departure airport, the closet airport. We informed ATC of our intent to return to our departure airport, and were cleared direct to the airport. We notified Dispatch and the Flight Attendants of our situation. We referenced the overweight landing checklist. We told the flight attendants this would be a normal landing, but did inform them of our indications in the cockpit. After a normal landing, ATC informed us there was no visible smoke. We taxied, parked, and accomplished all required check-list. The Avionics Smoke ECAM message was not displayed after shut-down.		During the climb out I noticed a Message that stated Land ASAP. I pointed it out to the First Officer. We looked at everything to see if we could find a problem. We could see no other indications. No ECAM or other warning lights. I thought it must just be incorrect message. With further investigation, after selecting ECAM recall there was an ECAM for Avionics Smoke. We checked the Flight Manual and it said to follow the ECAM if there was perceptible smoke. There was no smoke, flight attendants perceived no smoke and there were no warning lights. I was sure there was no real problem. In the past I had had this message before and an ECAM engine failure turned up. Well, it was easy to figure out the engine was fine. Not so easy to know if there is smoke in the avionics compartment. I sent some ACARS messages to Maintenance telling them what was happening to see if they had any ideas. We didn't get a response. Originally I thought we would just continue, but then I started feeling more uncomfortable with the situation and told the First Officer that we should return to our departure airport. I asked for a clearance back to our departure airport and notified Dispatch of our plan. Dispatch said our departure airport Operations was notified and we said that as of now the only thing we needed was a mechanic to meet us. We returned to our departure airport with an uneventful landing, except the landing was overweight. We wrote up the overweight landing, but since the rate of decent at touchdown was 100 FT per minute there was no inspection required. There were never any more warning lights and never any smoke. We parked, and our departure airport Operations did a great job of helping us. The mechanic did some computer resets; we refueled, got a new release from Maintenance and Dispatch and left again with no further problems.		A320 flight crew discovers a land ASAP ECAM Memo during climb out. No previous ECAM warnings had been received by the crew but when the recall button was pushed, an Avionics Smoke message is displayed. After some discussion the crew elected to return to the departure airport.

All systems functioned normally for the flight. At about 500 FT AGL on an approach to Runway XX circle YY, we had multiple ECAM's indicating BSCU 1, BSCU 2, Nose Wheel Steering, and Anti Skid were inoperative. We executed a go around and took delaying vectors in order to secure the systems and properly prepare for landing. We determined we were going to have to land in that configuration and declared an emergency. After landing we planned to taxi clear of the runway on one of the high speed taxiways, shut down and get towed to the gate. We experienced moderate chop the entire time we were in the pattern through final landing. I felt there was no need to prepare the cabin so we informed the flight attendants and passengers that we would be making a normal landing and that emergency equipment would be following the plane as a precaution. The landing and roll out was uneventful. I noted the airspeed was 110 KIAS at 55 KTS ground speed during the roll out so I didn't need to apply brakes until about 30 KTS ground speed. As a result there was virtually no chance of skidding the tires. We cleared the runway, the Fire Chief cleared the underside of the plane and we were towed to the gate after 30 minute wait. The First Officer's assistance and professional work was invaluable in ensuring this was an uneventful emergency. It felt like a simple training simulator session.				An A320 departed with BSCU 1 MELed and on final approach at the destination the ECAM alerted BSCU2, Nose Wheel Steering and Antiskid INOP. A go around was executed, the ECAM actions completed and a normal landing completed followed by a tow to the gate.

She said she had heard a banging sound, like someone was banging underneath her jumpseat. I asked if it was banging right now and she said no. Through more questions, I was able to determine that the noise started shortly after takeoff and ended soon after. I explained that the nose gear is right under their jumpseat and that it may have originated from the gear retracting.Later during the climb she called again and the Captain answered. She said she had heard the noise again. The Captain realized he was trimming the airplane at the time. We determined that the noise only occurred using the main electric trim. At FL290 I went to the Flight Attendant jumpseat area to listen for the noise as the Captain was trimming. I heard a muted sound when the Captain was trimming. I went back to the cockpit and the Captain and I discussed our options. We decided to leave the autopilot on as long as possible during the descent and approach thereby minimizing the use of the main electric trim. We landed at our destination without incident.				A B737-800 flight crew was alerted to a noisy stabilizer trim condition by an alert Flight Attendant.

Now I have used them twice this month!  The first was caused by a No. 1 tachometer and BSCU (2) failure and [that] caused wheels one and three to lock upon touchdown. Autobrakes were not selected but shortly after landing we received ECAMS for an autobrake failure then for a BSCU failure. On this second occurrence, my First Officer selected autobrakes to MED for strong crosswinds.  Shortly after landing he advised we were not getting braking and manually applied the brakes. There was no ECAM but the gear page showed AUTO BRAKES in amber and Alt Brakes in green. Although alternate brakes did have a different feel, there was no problem controlling or stopping the aircraft. (Although it would be more exciting in SNA!) When I called in the gripe to Maintenance, he said he was working another similar Airbus brake problem.	The lack of auto brakes on touch down was the first indication that something was amiss, then the ECAM gear page appeared showing auto brakes in amber and alternate brakes in green.  Automatic switching to the alternate brake system is normal with failure of the BSCU although none was indicated. Three weeks prior two tires failed on touch down due to a BSCU failure along with a number one tachometer failure.			An A320 Captain experienced auto brake failure on touch down.  The system subsequently switched automatically to the alternate brake system.

While maneuvering the logbook from the side pocket of the center pedestal on the Captain's side below the trim wheel I apparently bumped the number one engine start lever with the edge of the logbook, causing it to come out of the 'idle' DETENT and move approximately one inch towards 'cutoff'.  My First Officer called out an RPM decrease and applied manual ignition.  Putting the logbook aside, I immediately noticed the position of the start lever and placed it back in the 'idle' DETENT, then retarded the throttle to idle.  The minimum engine RPM observed was approximately 45% N1. It recovered immediately with normal engine indications at both idle and cruise power.  No exceedence observed.  An initial descent was requested and initiated, but the IAS decrease was only about ten knots. All power was restored within fifteen to twenty seconds. Descent was stopped at FL360.  Since the cause of the rollback was known, not mechanically caused, and all systems were normal, we continued flight to destination.  Made contact with cabin crew and subsequently made PA confirming all systems were normal.				A B737 Captain reported inadvertently bumping the number one engine start lever out of the idle position with the the Logbook.  The engine began to spool down and the lever is quickly returned to the idle position.  Flight continued to destination.

On descent we experienced some wing tip turbulence. Our airplane was coupled to the ILS and on assigned speed. Separation was 6.5 NM according to the Tower. The disruption continued and I contemplated a go-around. Since we were VFR (clear and unlimited visibility), I decided to disengage the auto-pilot and hand fly the glideslope 1/2 dot high to remain over the preceding aircraft's turbulence. The ride was much better, so I continued the approach to landing. We extended the gear handle at about 1,400 FT and extended the flaps. We landed within the first 3,000 FT, on speed.		We were late in slowing and configuring the aircraft and subsequently closing on the 777 in front of us (less than 4 miles). Wake turbulence occurred and the Captain disconnected the autopilot and hand flew 1/2 dot high to avoid the wake. Landing flaps 25 was requested before the gear and subsequent warning occurred. As the gear was coming down I heard the 1,000 FT call. Likely late on the 1,000 FT configuration, but in the slot and on speed at 500 FT. The landing was uneventful and in the touchdown zone. As I was the Relief Pilot on this flight and the Captain was the pilot flying. I cannot answer for the Captain as to weather fatigue was a factor in the approach, but it likely was as this was an all nighter flight.		A B777 flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence from a preceding B777 on arrival at EGLL. The Captain hand flew slightly high on the glideslope to avoid the preceeding aircrafts' wake and in the process a slightly delayed landing configuration occurred.

Fuel state enough for one approach and ZZZ1 filed alternate. Aircraft reported large airspeed loss on short final before touchdown with weather encroaching on departure end. Conditions unsafe to land, elected go around and requested vectors for ZZZ1. While vectored to ZZZ1, ATC reported same conditions at ZZZ1. Requested ZZZ2, ATC informed aircraft were holding for weather at ZZZ2. Requested ZZZ3, ATC informed weather same there. Can't remember exactly when Emergency fuel was declared however it was done quickly, either when considering ZZZ2 or ZZZ3. ATC informed weather was clearing west side of ZZZ airport, aircraft radar confirmed. Elected approach to ZZZ Runway YY. Elected to discontinue approach due to weather conditions on final and proceeded direct a non scheduled airport.  Landed with low fuel state.		While making an approach to Runway XX ILS, Tower reported a 17 KT loss over the runway. Heavy rain was advancing down the runway and we elected to go around on a 140 degree heading. We diverted to ZZZ1 only to find a 30 KT loss on final as weather engulfed the field. We continued towards ZZZ2 but were told that the weather was also bad and that aircraft were holding for ZZZ2. We reversed direction and headed for ZZZ3. Minutes later we were informed that ZZZ3 was now in heavy rain even though it was good only minutes earlier. Approach indicated that the weather was moving past the field and that a possible approach could now be made to Runway YY. We immediately turned towards the runway but had to discontinue the approach due to weather. At this point our fuel was 3.3 even though it had been 5.6 on the initial approach. At fuel 4.6 south bound to ZZZ3 I declared emergency fuel but now had no options [in this vicinity]. We then elected to turn towards the only open field within our available fuel. We proceeded direct [a non scheduled Air Carrier field] and made an uneventful landing.		An Air Carrier Aircraft executed a go around for turbulence and could not land at either of three vicinity airports because of weather. After declaring a fuel emergency the crew diverted to a non scheduled airport where they landed in a low fuel state.

As we continued to fly the glideslope we were actually about 500 to 800 FT low in altitude. At the outer marker, WILLT, the weather became VMC and noticed we were low. We also noticed that a jumbo jet was making a 90 degree turn to line up on Runway 28. This aircraft interfered with the localizer signal. The new holding area on the approach end of Runway 28 needs to be looked at. The aircraft that landed ahead of us also complained about a very similar phenomenom on final.		While still in IFR conditions; approaching the final approach fix for Runway 28, the glideslope slowly moved to almost 2 dots high. I slowly began correcting and just as we broke out I picked up the PAPI and noted we were low. Just then, Tower called us low. The First Officer and I both noted a B747-400 holding short of Runway 28 which was disrupting the ILS signal. I corrected to glide path and continued the approach. ORD Tower was contacted and they indicated this has happened several times since the new south side access was created to hold short of 28 for departure.		A320 flight crew experiences an unreliable glideslope during an ILS approach to Runway 28 at ORD. At WILLT the glideslope returns to normal and a B747 is noted holding short for Runway 28 on the south side. The Tower indicates that it has happened several times since the new south side access was constructed.

Captain's left rudder pedal rubber pad that covers metal apparently for traction on pedal to avoid slippage of foot under pressure. The result of maintenance action, fix, or work completed by maintenance personal. Maintenance signed off logbook as reattached, OK for flight operations. On Taxi out all procedures and checklists were completed In particular the flight control check to  confirm proper rudder control. Once cleared for takeoff the take off roll was normal, wind was gusting and attention was given to that. Still normal conditions I felt. However where it went wrong was right after liftoff. What I consider more pressure was going to be needed for control because of the current wind conditions WAS apply to the rudder PEDALS to control the aircraft was given. At that point the maintenance fix to the left rudder rubber pad came loose and caused my left foot slip a considerable amount to cause a moment of a control issue.  At some point I was able to get my foot in a position as to regain any control that was lost, BACK IN CONTROL. We are talking about SPLIT seconds during this time. I did not even have time to communicate with my Co-Captain what was happening even though a second after it all took place I believe he did comment.  Once safely airborne my Co-captain and myself had a discussion about how to continue rest of flight. We decided rather than return to the departure airport and put the passengers and aircraft in a situation of a heavy overweight landing (which would possibly require extreme rudder pressures due to a heavy landing weight) that we would continue to our destination, discuss and evaluate situation and communicate with dispatch on the issues.  On landing we decided even though it appeared that my the Captain's rudder pedal was usable it was not up to our Air Carrier's SAFETY STANDARDS OF MEETING AND EXCEEDING ALL SAFETY STANDARDS.   So out of MY (the CAPTAIN) concern, I made the decision to have the First Officer (Co-Captain ) land the aircraft just in case of any issues, engine  failure etc. Its this Captain's opinion that strongly feels that SAFETY conditions at our Air Carrier are being affected by the huge push from the top personal to GET THE AIRCRAFT OUT ON TIME for financial incentives. I know they would care first about the Safety of our passengers and aircraft. However I don't think they are possibly aware of what really is happening out on the line. I find myself having to watch and double check everything that may be a flight safety issue. However, the the culture of our Air Carrier's workplace STILL FEELS TERRIBLY RUSHED to GET the aircraft off the gate!!!  So in conclusion, in order to make it all SAFER when ANY issue comes up at the gate, no repercussions or discipline to employees will happen, for a simple late gate Departure.				An A320 Captain's rudder pedal rubber friction pad came off on takeoff in a cross wind with a rudder correction applied causing a momentary loss of control until the Captain's foot reestablished rudder contact.

Re-pressurized aircraft and no leaks found. Obtained a ferry permit and re-dispatched to a Maintenance Base FAR Part 91. Turned aircraft over to Maintenance. Return flight to destination at FL320 proved uneventful. Maintenance findings discovered a problem with the internal door mechanism. Perhaps a 500 hour check of the door mechanism might be in order to stay on top of this. Seems to be a recurring problem with the 737 L-1  door, from what I learned from Maintenance.				A B737-700's L-1 door failed to seal when closed prior to takeoff. The aircraft would not pressurize so the crew returned to land where Maintenance found that an internal door mechanism failed to position the door seal properly.

The rate of climb of the cabin was equal to the climb rate of the aircraft. We advised ATC that we had a pressurization problem and leveled at 6,000 FT. The cabin rate slowed but continued to climb. We verified the correct position of the packs and bleed switches and they were set correctly. We decided to climb to 9,000 FT to see if the problem would continue. As we did this, the flight attendants called us and told us there was a loud sound of rushing air coming from the forward entry door and the air coming in was quite cold. We had no indications that any of the doors were open. Based on what the flight attendants told us about the noise and temperature of the air entering the cabin, as well as our indications in the cockpit, the aircraft was not pressurizing and something was wrong with the forward entry door. We decided that we had to return for an overweight landing. We notified ATC of our intentions and were given box pattern vectors and a decent to 3,000 FT while we called Operations and Maintenance and told them what was going on. Since we were going to make an overweight landing (We landed weighing approximately 141,000 LBS), we felt it was best to declare and emergency in case something happened on landing like a brake overheating and starting on fire or structural damage. We made a visual approach to 1L and landed smoothly as requested by Maintenance and returned to the gate without further incident.				A B737-700's L-1 door failed to seal when closed prior to takeoff. The aircraft returned to land because it would not pressurized.

When we first contacted LAS Approach he told us 1L and put us on a 180 heading to join the line. We followed basically a 27 DME arc all the way around and were eventually handed off to the Final Controller who changed the Runway to 1R. So, we modified the box for an RNAV 1R, there was no ILS that my First Officer found and I was busy looking for traffic to have both heads down. About this same time we were told to steer 360 and intercept the localizer, we were at 9,000 MSL and needed to start down soon. So we queried about that and were given clearance to 8,000. The Controller pointed out traffic at 10 o'clock joining the localizer for 1L. Here the issue begins; we had this guy in sight, and the airport; it was very VFR. But the vector received by this other guy and our approach clearance put both of us down the chute in route echelon formation. Literally I was on a 45 degree aspect line with about 200 yards separation. Several times on the approach I got CLIMB and ADJUST VERTICAL SPEED from TCAS. Of course, this only exacerbated when we got closer to the approach end, and the force of 327G55 rolling off the hotels on the strip hit us. Suggestions, the worst issue here is, three times at least, during our vectors for the approach; this particular controller was asked specific questions about the pattern, the approach, etc. and his answer was 'I don't know, I'm still figuring it out'. We had to ask three times to confirm we were cleared for the approach. Tower seemed to deal with this as normal operations.				Air Carrier landing LAS expressed concern regarding ATC handling while being vectored to the final, noting the controllers' response to several questions regarding pattern/approach were answered with, 'I don't know, I'm still figuring it out.'

I then looked at altitude and airspeed and noticed aircraft speed approximately 10 KTS below target bug. I then looked at the engine indications and noticed a rolling back of number one engine speed and EGT. About half of a second later ENG FAIL was displayed on the number one engine gauges. The Captain then declared to me that he had the aircraft and requested that I declare an emergency with ATC, and to ask for a right 180 degree descending turn back toward our departure airport. I agreed and complied. The request was granted from ATC along with clearance to an initial altitude of 15,000 FT. The Captain then stated that he had the radios and the controls, and asked for the engine failure/shutdown checklist. I double checked to make sure there were no indications of engine fire or seizure, and then proceeded to execute the requested checklist. When it became time in the checklist to decide between a windmilling or cross bleed restart attempt we decided to choose a cross bleed start based on current aircraft altitude and airspeed. One restart was attempted, but there was never an engine relight. We then decided to continue in the checklist to secure the engine and set up and brief for a single engine landing back at our departure airport. All checklists were completed. The landing was uneventful and well executed by the Captain. After landing the Fire Department examined the aircraft exterior and the Captain, I, and the flight attendants determined that the aircraft and passengers were OK to taxi to the gate.				A B737-900 First Officer reported an engine failed at FL360. An emergency was declared and a return to departure airport safely accomplished.

Ran the STABILIZER ELECTRIC TRIM INOPERATIVE checklist from the QRH. We had manual trim control of the aircraft by using the flip-out handles on trim wheel. Declared an emergency with ATC and planned a flaps 15 landing. Landed without further incident and taxied to the gate. I communicated with each Flight Attendant and debriefed them of what had occurred along with a brief system explanation of the aircraft. I completed the maintenance log book write-up. Called Maintenance Control to de-brief them of the write-up to answer any questions about the incident. During descent ATC issued several crossing altitudes and speed restrictions that we were unable to comply with due to high workload. We gave ATC a brief explanation ('unable to trim aircraft electrically along with stabilizer problems').				A B737-700 Captain reported losing stabilizer trim in descent. An emergency was declared and a normal landing followed.

After discussing our options with Dispatch, Maintenance Control, and the expanded crew and with reverser pressurization and deployment a possibility, ZZZ was determined to be the best option for its longer runway in case of directional control issues. At the point of declaring an emergency, the distance to ZZZ and ZZZ2 made descent into ZZZ more manageable. The longer runway was requested as was CFR equipment as a precaution in the event the reverser situation deteriorated. The flight attendants were advised and took appropriate actions to prepare themselves and the cabin. Landing was normal.		The checklist action item is to land ASAP. It further notes that if a second ECAM occurs that indicates the reverser is pressurized, the effected engine should be brought to idle.

Shortly after takeoff, when climbing through about 1,500 FT AGL, the #2 engine oil quantity dropped to 2 quarts, then to 1 quart. Crew decided to make immediate return to land. Emergency declared with ATC, emergency equipment requested to be standing by. A normal landing was made at a landing weight of 146,700 LBS (overweight). During the entire event, there were no other abnormal engine indications, which continued to operate normally. During the approach to landing, the oil quantity slowly increased to 8 quarts. After gate arrival, Maintenance serviced engine with 20 quarts of oil and performed the overweight landing inspection. Brake Cooling Chart was consulted before next departure. Subsequently [we] departed the scheduled destination and engine operated normally. FYI - the 'Low Engine Oil Quantity' checklist was removed from the 737 QRH.		At gate, mechanic added 20 quarts of oil to the engine. There is no Low Oil Quantity checklist in the QRH. It was removed at some point. I'm sure there's a story behind that.		A B737-800's right engine oil quantity dropped to one quart during climb after takeoff so an emergency was declared and the aircraft returned to the departure airport where 20 quarts of oil were added.

Captain flew aircraft and I proceeded with ECAM which had me recycle flap handle. This did not fix the problem so I pulled out the book and finished the irregular procedure and called Maintenance. The refueling light never came back on at all after airborne by the way. We also had to stop climb at FL200 and stayed at 220 KTS for the rest of the flight. I went back to observe the slats from the cabin and saw that the slats were indeed not fully retracted and something was hanging from the fuel door area. With the concurrence of Maintenance and Dispatch we returned to the airport uneventfully. Flaps and slats all extended properly.		During high speed regime First Officer noticed green 'refueling' note come on then go off; when retracting slats from 1 to 0, received 'FLT/C SLAT FAULT'.

[We] elected to return to our departure airport [and] executed uneventful arrival.  Upon post flight inspection noticed refueling panel, with 1 latch open, and 2 closed, bent in a 'U' shape.		A320 flight crew experienced a refueling door note during takeoff which quickly extinguished. During slat retraction a FLT CNTL SLAT fault is indicated on ECAM and slats will not completely retract.

I read back '(Company and flight number) climbing to FL370.' At FL265 ATC told us to level at FL260. We complied. I then heard ATC tell (another airline same call sign) to climb to FL370. I confirmed with ATC that there was another airline with the same flight number on our frequency. ATC confirmed that there was and then cleared us to continue our climb. There was no conversation to confirm it, but I think we took the other flight's climb clearance, but our readback of our company and flight number climbing to FL370 was not caught and corrected by ATC. When he saw us climbing he had us stop the climb at FL260 and then had the other flight climb to FL370.ATC should always make flight crews aware when they check on to the frequency that there is another aircraft with the same flight number. Even after doing so they should listen to all readbacks to ensure the correct flight responds.				ATC failed to advise flight crews of the presence of two flights with identical flight numbers on the frequency.

The landing was uneventful and plane was safely stopped and shutdown on the runway prior to towing.		On an angling downwind getting vectors, in intermittent snow, we got a brakes A/SKID N/WS (Anti Skid Nose Wheel Steering) fault ECAM. There were no 'to dos' with the ECAM so I went to the book. The procedure had no actions either. I called Dispatch and asked him to get Maintenance on also. Maintenance had nothing to add so I told Dispatch what the situation was and told him I was going to declare an emergency and would need a tow off the runway. By the time I was done talking to everyone we were being vectored to final, I declared the emergency and reiterated that we would be stopping on the runway and would need to be towed off. The approach and landing were normal, we came to a full stop on the runway and switched to a discrete frequency and waited for the tow.		An A320 ECAM alerted BSCU during the initial approach phase so the crew completed the QRH procedures, flight crew declared an emergency and the aircraft was towed to the gate after landing.

We waited in the aircraft for the next flight plan paperwork to arrive while the Load Master changed loads. Our Maintenance Representative came to the aircraft to find out what we needed for fuel for the next leg. It was approximately XJ:30, 15 minutes before the flight was scheduled to depart and the flight plan had not arrived from our handler. The Maintenance Representative called Dispatch and got the Dispatcher to give him a fuel load of 107.9. He was given a final fuel load of 111.0 because we believed we were going to be there for another hour or so. The flight plan arrived a few moments from the handler who had been waiting for an hour trying to get our Dispatch office to fax or email the paperwork. We were then told by the Load Master that there were no changes to the weights. Since we wanted to depart on time, The Captain did the performance on the EFB, I loaded the FMS, and the Relief Pilot did the weight and balance. We checked each others work and then waited for the doors to close. The Load Master came to the cockpit to say that they needed to rebuild some of the pallets and we would be here another hour or so. We closed the doors at XK:35 and pushed back with no indications of trouble at XK:45. Departed normally and reached cruising altitude going to our next destination forty minutes after departure of XK:58. At top of climb, the Captain began entering winds into the FMS. After entering winds we received an 'Insufficient Fuel Message' and proceeded to look further at the cause. We found that the TOGW was significantly lower than that of the weight and balance. Dispatch was called, and we requested an enroute alternate to get more fuel but our Dispatcher had been in contact with our Vice President of Operations and told us to return to our departure airport as soon as possible. We had to jettison approximately 11,000 LBS of fuel to get to maximum landing weight. Returned without further incident and refueled and proceeded to continue on to the final destination. When inputting the winds at altitude the FMS computes new times based on the winds entered. The insufficient fuel warning on the FMS alerted the crew there was a problem. Pressure to get out on time for company and arrival slot into our destination, lack of further input by the Dispatch office to verify proper information and receipt, possible load mistakes because of the changes to the pallets and then lack of coordination to the Dispatcher handling the flight, [and] lack of further verification of the paperwork by the crew between each other. Once the information was determined to be correct, Dispatch was notified to get an alternative plan in place. The Company decided that the best course of action was to return to the departure airport. A new line item on the flight plan that stays at the station should be put into place where flight crews would have to fill in the calculated (weight and balance) numbers right under flight plan take-off and landing weights. Load Masters and Dispatch should also be required to confirm the weights they calculated before a flight plan is dispatched to that flight.		Upon review of the entire incident I have determined several items. First a lot of coordination was involved in a short span of time followed by another lengthy time delay. Pressure to get out on time for company and arrival slot into our destination, lack of further input by the Dispatch office to verify proper information and receipt, possible load mistakes because of the changes to the pallets and then lack of coordination to the Dispatcher handling the flight [and] lack of further verification of the paperwork by the crew between each other. Once the information was determined to be correct, I awoke the other crew members who had already gone to the bunks to get them involved in the decision process. I called Dispatch to get an alternative plan, get a Supervisor involved and to awake the Chief Pilot. The company decided that the best course of action was to return to the departure airport. When we received flight plans a normal check is done. Once that is complete we should have one of the Relief Pilot's look over all paperwork before proceeding. Each should sign or initial to determine that it was reviewed. Dispatch should be more cognizant of what they issue for length of flights. A new line item of Actual TOGW should be added underneath TOGW to the flight plan so you can see if the real weight is as close to the estimated weight.		A B777 returned to the departure airport because an INSUFFICIENT FUEL message alerted at cruise after the FMS winds were entered while airborne.

We proceeded direct to SHEAD across the mountain range and continued the climb out. The First Officer was flying the aircraft with the autopilot coupled with LNAV and VNAV selected. Sometime after passing through approximately FL290, the First Officer selected Vertical Speed at 2,000 FT per minute because the aircraft was 'searching' for a stable climb rate. He failed to verbalize this and I failed to recognize it due to replacing the Commercial Chart approach pages. Passing through FL370, I heard the altitude alert bell and stated thirty seven for thirty eight. I then saw the yellow airspeed warning band starting to rise up, but we were still approximately thirty knots below our current speed. At about FL378 the autopilot clicked off and A.74 was flashing in the MCP speed display. We were still well above the yellow airspeed bar but the aircraft began to descend. We did not receive the stall warning 'stick shaker' but this was very uncomfortable. The aircraft was descending and the First Officer and I both added full thrust. I informed ATC we were descending to FL370 and told the First Officer to descend. ATC asked if everything was OK and I informed him that we had just had a large airspeed loss and we weren't able to maintain FL380. We were cleared to FL360 and descended to that altitude. After leveling at FL360 we were asked again by ATC if we were OK or need assistance. I told them we were OK and we thought we encountered mountain wave turbulence as we were leveling off at FL380. He said he hadn't had any reports of it yet and began to query other aircraft. We reviewed the performance data, the Flight Release, and the load sheet several times. According to the FMC our optimum altitude was FL388 and the performance data said we were good well above FL400 down to .70 Mach. We weighed 131.1, the temperature was -34C, and the FMC cruise speed was .777. After reviewing this several times and being satisfied we were well within our weight and optimum altitude at FL380, we decided to try to return to our filed altitude. Again the autopilot was coupled in LNAV and VNAV with auto throttles selected and we began a climb at FMC climb speed of about .77 Mach at 1,500 FPM. At FL375, we almost instantly lost 20-25 KTS and the climb rate reduced to 100-200 FPM. We very slowly climbed to FL380 and leveled off but it felt very uncomfortable and we were back in some turbulence and decided to return to FL360. At this time, we started receiving ATC mountain wave +/- 10-20 KT reports. We also encountered more mountain wave turbulence as our route was over the mountain ranges quite a bit. I sent a message to Dispatch and asked if he would review/verify the release and load sheet weights as we were unable FL380 and that I would call at our destination. The remainder of the flight was uneventful and we agreed that we must have encountered mountain wave just as we were leveling off at FL380 the first time. When we arrived at our destination I verified with the Ramp that the cargo weight was indeed only 4,600 LBS, and called to inform Dispatch of what had happened. We discussed all the possible causes and again agreed that we had encountered mountain wave turbulence. In over twelve years here at the company and in over twenty years of flying I have never encountered turbulence like this before. I informed the oncoming Crew of the events and, by this time, the entire area along our route of flight was boxed in multiple turbulence alerts on his weather packet.		The Captain reported to ATC that we were unable to maintain FL380 and needed to get clearance for a lower altitude. We were therefore given a descent to FL360 which we complied with. Upon reaching that altitude, we started to investigate why the deviation had occurred. The aircraft flew fine at FL360. We talked about the Vertical Speed issue as a possibility and also worked on the performance numbers. Upon running all of the numbers we discovered that not only should we have been able to maintain altitude but that we should have been good to go at as slow an airspeed of .70 Mach at FL380. We therefore decided to attempt to climb back up to FL380 (at current weight our optimum was nearly FL390). In VNAV the aircraft climbed at approximately 1,700 FPM and had slowly decreased to 1,350 FPM by 37,400 FT. At that altitude we nearly instantaneously lost twenty knots of airspeed. The aircraft reduced its Vertical Speed to between 100 and 200 FT per minute and could not climb any faster nor increase airspeed until reaching FL380. Only upon leveling off completely did the aircraft slowly increase airspeed back to cruise speed. Based on that performance, the Captain and I decided it would be more prudent to return to FL360 which we received clearance for and did. We continued to encounter mountain wave turbulence from that point on (+/- 20 KTS) until well north. While the Vertical Speed climb undoubtedly put us in a position to be more vulnerable to mountain wave the first time we were climbing to FL380, we think that the ultimate cause of the problem was mountain wave turbulence. There were no reports of mountain wave turbulence prior to the incident. Following the incident there were several reports of it including reports up and down the mountain range we flew along. However, based on this the wave would not have been avoidable except perhaps with greater awareness crossing mountain ridges. The contributing factor of the Vertical Speed versus VNAV in the initial climb was preventable. Two things would have helped. First, greater and less casual communication between Crew Members regarding flight mode changes would be helpful. Second, a greater emphasis upon ensuring that the flight mode selected is what the aircraft is actually flying.		A B737-700 climbing northbound at FL370 on the LAS SNEAD 7 RNAV encountered a mountain wave which caused a 20-25 KT airspeed decrease and an uncommanded descent.

Because this had occurred on the last three flights, it wasn't totally unexpected. The Captain (non flying pilot) accomplished the ECAM procedure and everything worked as advertised. Approximately two hours into the flight the First Officer (flying pilot) noticed the fuel page was displayed on the lower ECAM screen. The right inner and outer wing tanks were full of fuel and flashing green. The right wing did not appear to be feeding. The left wing tanks appeared to be feeding normally except that the fuel on that side was significantly lower than expected. The center tank was empty. The Captain referred to the Flight Manual (FM) but didn't find a procedure to cover this situation. During this time the First Officer did some basic fuel calculations. The calculations considered trapped fuel in the right wing, inaccurate gauge indications and fuel being transferred from the left wing tanks to the right wing tanks. According to these calculations, there would potentially not be enough fuel to continue to the destination. Both pilots discussed the situation and concluded that both engines were being fed from the left wing tanks. Both were unclear as to whether the fuel in the right wing tanks was trapped or whether the full indications were inaccurate. In either case, the amount of fuel onboard was uncertain. The Captain decided to call Dispatch and Maintenance to get their thoughts and to help remedy the situation. He described our situation and indications to Maintenance who suggested resetting circuit breakers which had no effect on the problem. Both the Captain and the First Officer became increasingly uncomfortable with the developing situation and agreed that it would not be prudent to continue the trip. The Captain, with the concurrence of the First Officer made the decision to divert. Dispatch suggested diverting to a nearby airport. A normal descent and landing was accomplished and the flight continued to the destination on an alternate airplane.				An A320's fuel crossfeed system malfunction prevented the right wing fuel tanks from feeding an engine and possibly pumping the left wing tank fuel to fill the right wing tanks (inner and outer). The flight diverted to a nearby airport.

The traffic was acquired visually well before our level off and presented no apparent conflict potential. Just prior to level off (approximately 300 FT) the TCAS presented a TA followed by an RA. This resulted in a momentary fly through of assigned altitude of 175 FT as observed on the Captain's PFD. An immediate return to the cruise altitude was underway even before ATC inquired about our altitude; the event was that brief. In short, in this particular situation, the TCAS essentially complicated what would have been a routine autopilot on level off with crossing traffic. I made a call to ATC upon arrival at our destination to ensure no additional information was needed or questions remained open.				A B737-800 overshot its assigned cruise altitude by 175 FT during climb and received a TCAS RA from opposite direction traffic as the reporter's aircraft returned to its assigned altitude.

He reported he was very busy and gave us further descent clearance to 9,000. In near disbelief I explained that being busy is a ridiculous excuse for flying us into a conflict with another aircraft. He apologized and reiterated how busy he was. This is completely unacceptable. This lapse could have caused the loss of both aircraft and numerous lives.

The winds were light and there had been no turbulence on the approach so this was totally unexpected. I briefly considered a rejected landing/go around but was able to roll the airplane level and get back to centerline. After clearing the runway, I queried Ground Control about the situation and learned that a corporate jet had been cleared for takeoff on Runway 18L at Intersection A at the same time we were landing on Runway 23. Due to the very close proximity of Runway 18L intersection A to the touchdown zone of Runway 23, Charlotte Tower should not be clearing aircraft for takeoff from this point while aircraft are landing on Runway 23. Runway 23 already poses its own set of challenges; a relatively short runway with a downhill slope. In addition Charlotte Tower very frequently uses Runway 23 when a tailwind component exists. Encountering jet blast while landing can place the aircraft in an unsafe position very quickly.				An A320 First Officer reported encountering jet blast on approach to Runway 23 at CLT from a corporate jet taking off on Runway 18L.

We called Center and requested a descent to 9,000 FT while we completed the ECAM for the problem. When we leveled at 9,000 we had enough differential pressure from the bleed system that the cabin remained below 7,000 FT. At that point we sent a message to operations that we were going to return and have Maintenance look at our problem. We also advised the flight attendants. We sent a 2nd message to Operations advising them that we would be landing overweight. We went through the QRH and FOM to cover all events of the landing. The First Officer did a great job in helping with this.After landing we taxied to the gate where Maintenance advised us the forward cargo door latch mechanism was broken. He said a new latch was coming over from the hanger and that it would take about an hour and 1/2 to install. We made all log book entries and I called operations for a new release. All operations normal after latch mechanic fixed.				An A320 flight crew returned to their departure airport when the latch mechanism on the forward cargo door failed and the cabin altitude started to climb.

After one minute the Flight Attendant called and said he still smelled the wire burning smell. He also said the Circuit Breaker (CB) panel in the aft galley was hot. At this time the Captain told me to ACARS the company and tell them we were diverting. The Captain declared an emergency with center. Flight attendants were told to prep the cabin but to expect a normal landing. Normal approach and landing were made. Once on the ground Maintenance was called to inspect the smell.

Aircraft was IMC during parts of climbout and we broke out of IMC at 8,000 FT enroute to 9,000 FT. There were three large convective cells in front of us less than five miles in range. I asked the Captain to request left deviation from ATC to avoid cells. As I recall, the autopilot captured and maintained 9,000 FT. ATC approved the left deviation at which time I began turning the aircraft left. I noticed a sudden updraft as we topped one of the cells and started pushing forward on the yoke, but was not overriding the force of the updraft. I noticed a target on TCAS less than 1,000 FT above our altitude (approximately 800 FT or so) and simultaneously a 'Monitor Vertical Speed' alert. I elected to break right in the opposite direction to avoid the conflict while continuing to push forward on the yoke. Forward pressure on the yoke overrode the autopilot and it disconnected. The Captain advised me that we were climbing still and assisted me with forward yoke pressure. The climb stopped at about 9,500 FT and we began a steep descent to avoid a conflict. I descended back to 9,000 FT. Once clear of traffic, the Captain advised ATC that we had lost the 1,000 FT separation due to storm updraft and the Controller advised that he understood. The Captain called an ATC Supervisor upon landing and explained the event. Had I known immediately that there was traffic above us when we leveled off I may have recommended that we continue present course and penetrate the cells in front of us and accept the imminent turbulence. The resultant updraft, coupled with an approved turn toward the traffic target, caused the deviation from altitude and the 'Monitor Vertical Speed' warning. Perhaps if we continued straight ahead into the cell, the aircraft might have passed behind us. Also, had I disconnected the autopilot manually a couple of seconds prior perhaps I could have gotten the aircraft into a descent more quickly. I'm not sure because I was fighting an uncommanded climb. Without knowing then that the updraft would cause an uncommanded climb, I then became focused on trying to keep the Vertical Speed on the VSI out of the red area to avoid the conflict. Taken individually I think each event could have been handled satisfactorily without incident but, in this particular case, everything happened simultaneously and there was a tremendous amount of information to prioritize in an instant. In the future, I might elect to disconnect the autopilot pro actively and fly directly into the cell using manual control inputs.		During the climbout, we were given a turn to heading 090 and climb and maintain 9,000 FT. At about 8,000 FT, we broke out of the weather while we were getting a TA on the TCAS identifying traffic heading for us at 10,000 FT. This was not unusual because we had a high climb rate but it was distracting none the less. Meanwhile, we noticed two large weather buildups right in front of us that looked to be building fairly quickly and with tops above 9,000 FT (probably around 11,000 FT). They did not show up on our radar and we did not see them until we broke out of the overcast at 8,000 FT. We quickly asked for a deviation left, but it was too late and we were going into the top of the left buildup. As we entered the top of the buildup, I could see that we had an excessive climb rate going through 9,000 FT. I told the pilot flying to watch the altitude and I could see him pushing forward on the yoke and the autopilot had kicked off. Since he saw us heading for the traffic at 10,000 FT, he turned right as we both pushed forward to stop the aircraft from climbing. We stopped the climb at 9,500 FT and came out of the other side of the buildup. ATC asked us to confirm that we were given a climb to 9,000 FT. I confirmed this and told them we were back at 9,000 FT. It was apparent that we had lost 1,000 FT separation with the aircraft at 10,000 FT so I explained to ATC that we experienced an updraft from the buildup and we momentarily were above 9,000 FT. He told me that he understood. I called the ATC Supervisor when we landed and explained the event.As the pilot not flying, I could have been more aggressive at helping the pilot flying get the aircraft back on altitude. This situation developed very quickly and insidiously. I will be more diligent at watching for buildups in the future.		B737 flight crew experiences an updraft during level off at 9,000 FT causing an overshoot and TCAS RA with opposite direction traffic at 10,000 FT.

ATC had cleared us to descend to 8,000 FT and called out traffic '10 o'clock, 3 miles, altitude indicates 7,300 FT. Leaving approximately 8,500 FT, we received a Traffic Alert, followed less than two seconds later by a 'Climb, Climb. The Captain disengaged the autopilot and immediately added power and started to climb. We were both on 20-mile scale since we were on a wide downwind, but when I looked at the VSI, I also noted that we were at approximately 8,100 FT with 300 FT of separation from the traffic that appeared to be right under our nose (according to the radar). We were never able to pick up the traffic visually because there was a broken layer from approximately 6,000 FT to 8,000 FT. I monitored the Vertical Speed and our separation and saw that we never approached the traffic closer than 300 FT. The best I can figure, based on our indications, the uncontrolled traffic must have climbed to at least 7,800 FT and was unaware of our presence. I told Charleston Approach about the RA and he responded, 'Okay, traffic is behind you, no factor.'ATC put us into a situation by vectoring us on a downwind with traffic near our altitude. They were obviously not talking to this other traffic, because there is no way they would have put us that close. This situation was made worse by the fact that the uncontrolled traffic was flying in and around a thick broken layer of clouds which prevented us from ever gaining visual contact. Charleston Approach needs to know that this is too close for two airplanes that are not both under their control.		Approaching 8,000 FT, we got a TCAS TA followed quickly by a Climb RA. I disconnected the autopilot and auto throttle and executed the RA maneuver. I never did see the traffic, and the TCAS showed him 300 FT below our altitude. The First Officer said he saw our minimum altitude at 8,100 FT. Approach Control should not have vectored us on a converging path with an aircraft they apparently weren't talking to and that was maneuvering at a non-standard altitude.		B737 flight crew experienced a TCAS RA during descent into CHS. Crew had been advised of the VFR traffic by Approach Control.

No other malfunctions present: electrical, ADR's (Air Data Reference) or pitot/static. Reset Breakers all OK, no Circuit Breakers ECAM displayed open, no ECAM, memos or messages present. No abnormal guidance was available or known to us on the flight deck to rectify this in-flight loss of the ISIS. [We] could not find any applicable QRH procedure [and] could not locate in MEL for reference information either. The ISIS was positively operational climbing through FL180, because I observed both pilot not flying and pilot flying perform the 18,000 FT flow requiring setting STD. I feel the ISIS had just failed when we noticed it because all 3 flight crew members discovered it inoperative simultaneously. The Captain established SATCOM voice with Dispatch and Maintenance. Maintenance was at a loss for cause and indicated no receipt of datalink messages regarding ISIS failure. There was little or no guidance from Dispatch or Maintenance on options for dealing with this situation pertaining to continuing operations, turn back and landing or ETOPS capability. The flight crew felt it was required equipment since it was not in the MEL and also most likely required in-flight for continuing operations and entering ETOPS/Long Range Navigation conditions. Reluctant to continue long range operations with this degraded condition, we considered the prospects of a turn back/diversion and landing. This would most likely itself involve more than one hour of flight time and/or hours of fuel burn-off to maximum landing weight in this degraded condition. If we diverted/returned to field we wanted to have the ISIS back. If we continued, we had to have the ISIS back. Flight conditions were black night, on top, perhaps higher cirrus, no visible horizon. Due to our training, we considered an operable ISIS fundamental in the recovery of any potential unreliable airspeed abnormal. The only method Maintenance was aware to regain the ISIS was by an Electronic and Equipment Compartment (EE) Circuit Breaker (C/B) reset. We consulted and received Dispatch and Maintenance direction and authorization via SATCOM voice and ACARS to attempt a C/B reset in the EE compartment. 'PER MX OKAY TO ATTEMPT RESET PANEL H5 742VU D64 ALSO K66 DISPATCH XA:59 END.' With the Captain's permission, I as the Relief Pilot gained access to the EE area. The three approved C/B's were found in the 'IN' position. Per Maintenance direction I pulled all 3 C/B's and left them open for approximately 30 seconds. I then reset all 3 in the same order to the 'IN' position. Upon returning to the flight deck, the ISIS was observed doing a self test, and then it regained full complete operation/display. We advised Maintenance and Dispatch and maintained our progress to the Oceanic Entry Point. We monitored the ISIS, continued normal operation and felt it was now prudent to continue with no further problem. Maintenance and Dispatch concurred. We experienced no further ISIS difficulty on the flight. An early alert 'Info only Item' describing the ISIS failure, C/B reset and recovery was entered in the logbook. Engineer meeting the flight was briefed by the Captain regarding the write up.				An A330 ISIS displayed the message DO NOT USE with the attitude, airspeed, altitude, magnetic heading, and glide slope missing. The crew reset the applicable circuit breakers in the EE compartment to successfully restore the ISIS.

[We] accomplished ECAM procedure. When center tank [was] no longer feeding, [I] was somewhat surprised to see on fuel page a very large imbalance. The fact that right tank was full suggested to us both engines were being fed from left tank and right tank was not feeding right engine. Even though cross-feed was open per ECAM and we were in process of closing, we concluded left pumps could not completely override right pumps, therefore a feed issue. Because of our uncertainty as to how much if any fuel was available from right tank and our flight path was approaching terrain and not so many good diversion airports, we felt the safest course was to divert to an airport less than 100 miles away. Had the right tank quantity burned down even a small amount, I would have assessed an imbalance vs. a feed problem. The fact the right tank was full along with past aircraft history of fuel problems led us to conclude we had a fuel feed problem, plus the uncertainty of our total fuel quantity, influenced our decision to divert. Normal landing, conferred with Maintenance, and were away in an hour with new airplane.				A320 Captain experiences center tank fuel pump failure in cruise and opens crossfeed valve in compliance with ECAM.

I noticed that the right pack light was on. We completed the QRH checklist. The pack light did not go out so we returned to the gate. A flight attendant called the cockpit to report that she heard a series of 4 beeps or alarms, possibly coming from the floor beneath the aft galley floor, as we taxied into the gate. Maintenance personnel reported that there were no vehicles in the vicinity of the gate as we taxied in and that there was nothing abnormal in the cargo compartment. No source of the sounds was found. Maintenance performed tests on the right pack and the engine at the gate. No problems were found. I got a new flight plan for FL240 as a precaution against a pack failure or loss of pressurization in flight.We experienced normal engine start, taxi, takeoff and climb. All systems were functioning normally so I chose to climb to FL280. Approximately 15 minutes after level off, Flight Attendant 1 called the cockpit to report that a flight attendant was feeling faint and was on oxygen. I told her to page for a physician and to call me back with an update. I checked the cabin altitude and the differential pressure. Both were normal, the cabin altitude was approximately 4,800 FT. I set the cruise altitude to FL240 and observed the cabin altitude decreasing. I requested a descent to FL240. A few minutes later, Flight Attendant 1 called back and that a passenger had become ill. Before completing her report on the ill passenger, she stated that another flight attendant was talking incoherently. I asked her if she had found a physician. I asked her to get me the passenger's seat number and to give an update on their condition. Flight Attendant 1 did not reply to my question about a physician and hung up, apparently to attend to the other flight attendant.The First Officer and I began to prepare to divert. I observed the cabin altitude decreasing and the differential pressure increasing. I then attempted to contact Dispatch via the radio to coordinate a diversion. I was unable to contact Dispatch. I informed ATC that we were going to divert. Flight Attendant 1 called again to report that another passenger was feeling faint with tingling in her fingers. She also reported that all of the oxygen bottles were being used and they needed to have the passenger oxygen system deployed. At this point, Flight Attendant 1 sounded hurried and alarmed so I deployed the masks. Deploying the oxygen masks would ensure that everyone had oxygen and that the flight attendants could then use the walk around bottles, if needed. We declared an emergency with ATC. We asked for further descent and a clearance to our divert airport. I made a PA informing the passengers that we were going to divert and would be landing in approximately 10 minutes. First Officer and I discussed donning our oxygen masks. We were descending thru approximately FL150 and the cabin altitude was approximately 2,000 FT and decreasing normally. There were no fumes or odors. There was no sign of smoke. The flight attendants did not report any fumes, odors or signs of smoke. I told First Officer that I felt fine and asked him how he felt. He replied that he was fine. Due to the fact that we were already in descent and would be below 10,000 FT very quickly, I felt that there would be no benefit to our use of the oxygen masks. Further, we had both been through military high altitude chamber training and are familiar with the effects of high altitude. We were not experiencing any symptoms and the cabin altitude was normal. I did not believe that there was an issue with the air quality in the cockpit or the cabin. From the information I was given by the flight attendants, the symptoms were limited to a couple of passengers and 2 flight attendants. Although unusual, I felt that the problems were caused by cabin altitude and not cabin air quality. We landed without incident and taxied to the gate. Paramedics met the aircraft. Ientered the cabin to assess the situation and coordinate with the paramedics. All passengers and flight attendants were alert and appeared normal. The paramedics entered the aircraft to assess the passengers' condition. The paramedics did not treat anyone. After approximately 10 minutes, the passengers deplaned. All passengers and crew appeared normal and walked off the aircraft under their own power. Several passengers complimented the flight attendants on their performance. Four passengers and one flight attendant went to the hospital. I was told that the passengers and the flight attendant were asthmatic. Two passengers returned and went on the flight to ORD. Only a few passengers reported symptoms. A non-revenue air carrier pilot reported that he had no symptoms although he was sitting behind an ill passenger. I have been informed that someone may think that I should have performed a Smoke, Fire or Fumes, Smoke or Fumes Removal, or other checklist during this event. I am submitting this report in response to a possible violation of procedure. There was no report of smoke, or fumes in the cabin. No odors were reported. The First Officer and I did not detect smoke, fumes or odors. The First Officer and I had discussed the fact that we had both been through military high altitude chamber training. I also discussed a loss of pressurization event I had in while flying an F-4. I am very familiar with the symptoms of hypoxia. The fact that only a few of the passengers were affected led me to conclude that whatever caused the symptoms was not airborne but was related to the cabin altitude and the overall health of those individual passengers and flight attendants. I am told that each affected passenger or crewmember is asthmatic. I also felt is was possible that the flight attendants and some passengers had not eaten that morning due to the early departure and that may have contributed to their symptoms. Deploying the passenger masks appeared to be the best solution to the problem. A rapid or emergency descent would not alleviate the symptoms as quickly as deploying the oxygen masks and were already at a relatively low cabin altitude. Completing the smoke removal or other checklist would have delayed the landing. My intent was to land as soon as possible and get medical attention for the ill passengers and crew. Having no known cause for the problem, I felt that was the best course of action.				A B737-800 diverted due to undiagnosed respiratory problems experienced by passengers and flight attendants.

While starting our climb to 14,000 we were passing 9,800 we heard a loud explosion with a yaw to the right followed by Master Warning and Master Caution lights. I noticed the #2 engine EGT was red lined and the engine had failed. We declared an emergency with Departure and told them we had an engine failure and needed to return to the airport and wanted to land on the center runway and to have equipment standing by.We did the ECAM procedures and QRH. The Relief Pilot did a great job with the passengers and the company and the Flight Attendant's as after the engine failed the cabin was reported to have smoke in it and the Flight Attendant's were concerned. We were able to clear the smoke quickly and ran all check lists and did an over weight landing with a full stop on the runway for inspection or the tires and for fire. The Flight Attendant's were briefed to expect a normal landing.				An A330 flight crew declared and emergency and returned to their departure airport following the failure of the right engine.

The crack was not of the usual variety in that it did not spider web. This caused concern regarding structural integrity. We were in descent from FL250 to FL210 at the time of the incident. I advised ATC that we would be slowing and needing lower altitude due to the crack we had in the windshield. I also sent a quick ACARS message to Dispatch. The Dispatcher declared us an emergency aircraft and notified ATC accordingly.[Flight Management] guidance was to reduce differential pressure to 5 PSI or below. When I pulled up pressure page we were at 5.8 decreasing, so we attained the needed differential pressure quickly. I briefed the Purser on our situation stressing we were not in immediate danger and for the crew to prepare for landing with touch down in approximately 20 minutes. I then briefed our passengers on the situation and that they may notice the fire trucks following us after landing. We continued with SOP descent approach and landing. After securing aircraft at gate we made Maintenance write up and were then met by Flight Management. We went to conference room and conferred with Flight Operations Duty Manager and ZZZ Flight Management. We decided that it would be best if we discontinued our ID and return home.		I had my sun visor in front of me and moved it to the side. Upon moving it I noticed a crack in the windshield that ran from the top right hand corner of the windshield to about 3/4 of the way across and about 1/3 of the way down the windshield. From there it spider [webbed] out into two directions for about 3 inches and the other about 7 inches.		An A320 flight crew suffered a cracked windshield during arrival sequencing.

It seemed rather odd since we were in VMC conditions and hundreds of miles from any clouds.  Then within 10-15 seconds, we saw light smoke accompanied by a very bright orange streak moving from the upper right (where it looks like the window heat electrical plug connects) to the lower left.  Even though we never got an Overheat Caution light to illuminate, we immediately turned off the window heat switch for L-1.  Next we saw two cracks on the outer pane of the windscreen.  The first was caused by the initial orange streak and the second began from the middle of the upper portion all the way down to the bottom of the pane.  We then referenced the Window Damage QRH.  While reading the checklist, we determined that the cracks were to the outer pane and that the differential pressure restrictions did not apply. The final statement in the QRH for an outer pane crack is to 'Continue Normal Operation.'  However, to err on the conservative side, we requested a descent with Center to FL 240 and began a 1000 fpm descent.  I then notified the Flight Attendants that we had an issue with the forward windscreen and that we were beginning a shallow descent.  I also announced to the Passengers that the seatbelt sign was coming on, but did not tell them of our problem.  We then continued our descent with the Fort Worth Center and landed uneventfully at our planned destinationI did not fully grasp the seriousness of this situation until the next day when I read an article that stated that there have been a number of 'window fires' in Boeing 757/67 aircraft, and also faulted the Crews for not diverting.  After reading that article, I realized that with seeing smoke and the orange streak, we too had experienced a window fire.  I think that the information in the QRH needs to be expanded in order to distinguish between a regular crack and a fire.  Perhaps a boxed/immediate action could be added to have the Crew turn off the window heat switch at the first sign of smoke/fire indications.  Perhaps our Safety Team in conjunction with Boeing could investigate if this condition requires the Crew to land as soon as practical.				The Flight Crew of a B757-200 assumed a cracked Captain's windshield was not an emergency item but later learned that the actual event was an electrically initiated fire that has plagued the fleet of late.

There was a mechanic in the jetway. He asked if I called Maintenance. I said no. He told me that somebody called him about ENG #1 EPR probe. He told me Maintenance had worked on the EPR probe and there was some excess material on the probe. He told me the aircraft could operate with the EPR probe in this condition for 14 days. He also told me that the probe had already been written up. He also informed me that the EPR probe was on maintenance watch. I meet the First Officer in the cockpit. I asked him if he called Maintenance. He said he did call because there was some kind of material around the EPR probe. I checked the log book and discovered that engine #1 EPR probe had been written up twice. The write ups were both the same: On climb out EPR #1 fault. Departed [and] at about FL 190 received ECAM message: Engine #1 EPR fault. We completed the ECAM, the QRH and then consulted ECAM Non-Normal Supplemental Manual. The manual recommended we try to recover EPR mode by switching off both ENG N1 Mode PB. The EPR recovery failed. I sent Dispatcher/Maintenance Control a message about the EPR fault. Dispatch informed me that our destination was VFR and to proceed. I agreed and continued. The following contains some of the ACAR messages between Dispatch and me. Dispatch: This is a chronic problem. They recommended a return to departure airport. I didn't print my messages to Dispatch but the following is close to what I actually sent. Captain: Are you sure you want me to return to departure airport. I'm 20,000 LBS overweight. Dispatch: Technicians and parts to destination please return to departure airport at this time. Please advise landing weight. Captain: I need to burn down to 142.2 I now weight 160.0K. Dispatch: We are doing this under strong recommendation from Maintenance Control. Captain: In an emergency I will land overweight but this is a convenience not an emergency. Dispatch: Landings can be accomplished safely if as a crew you think it is not prudent in the area of safety to continue holding in your current ATC environment. etc. I personally do not see a need to declare an emergency. Dispatch: Maintenance advises no problem with overweight landing as long as you record rate of descent an actual weight. Captain: I will do an overweight landing. Dispatch: Maintenance is ok with overweight landing; your Dispatcher in full agreement with your decision to do and overweight landing. I had the First Officer fly the approach and landing. I informed the Flight Attendants and passengers that we were returning. We landed at 151,500 LBS at 200 FPM on the longest runway. Touchdown was normal with normal brake temperatures once we parked the aircraft.I agreed to land overweight but I had a gut feeling that this was the wrong decision. I decided to try and burn as much fuel as possible enroute. We descended to 12,000 FT, extended the speed brake and started the APU. I then consulted the FOM and the QRH to see if I could find some information that would support an overweight landing. There is no information in the FOM under Overweight landing that supports or denies such an event. There is one note about overweight landing at a non-maintenance station. The note indicates that a Captain with Maintenance Control's help can sign off an overweight landing and return the aircraft to service. I felt this was still a weak argument for an overweight landing. I then checked the QRH and found nothing to support or deny the landing. In the end I landed overweight. I let Dispatch and Maintenance talk me into a landing that should have never happened. I knew I could land and stop the aircraft on a 12,000 FT runway. I also knew I would land with less than a 200 FPM sink rate. I also knew the landing would be safe but a limitation is a limitation is a limitation.		The crew then advises they would be overweight for landing. Thus began the discussion between crew and myself on the issue of an overweight landing. They held for some time and our landing weight was 150,000 LBS. A review of our ACARS history will clearly state that upon discussion with Maintenance and with the crew I did not see a safety issue with an overweight landing. Any reference to crew and passenger convenience and petrol is secondary on my list of concerns. The airport was VFR with no gusty winds, good runway length and runway conditions. When asked whether an overweight landing could be accomplished - my reply was yes and that I saw no problem with it other than an overweight landing inspection being required. I would like to see absolute and clear guidance in both the flight and dispatch manuals for the decision making process regarding overweight landings. If there is currently a company bulletin or company guidance in existence then I clearly need recurrent training regarding this. Past practices with our airline are not in sync on this issue. As I stated to our Chief Pilot in an e-mail; 'for future action on my part as a Dispatcher - in no way will I be in agreement with a flight crew wanting to perform an overweight landing unless the crew deems it an operational necessity to conduct a safe operation regarding a particular flight.' my thanks to the crew for completing a safe operation during an overweight landing.		An A320 returned to their departure airport for an overweight landing when a chronic EPR Probe ECAM warning recurred during the climb.

We got an ECAM 'F/CTL Flaps Locked' message.  With flaps at 2, the gear down and stabilized the First Officer continued flying while I checked the QRH which was already opened from my earlier use. I consulted the chart for flaps/slats performance and established from the chart that the runway was more than twice as long as required and that the safest thing to do was to land. Our fuel was about 6.0 at the time. I finished the ECAM action and we landed easily making the normal turnoff intersection. We taxied to the gate, contacting Maintenance on the way in. I made the proper write up in the logbook.  Maintenance said the airplane had just come out of C check. My First Officer said everything looked normal on his preflight. When we took off the temperature was 3c and for our landing it was 28c.				Following receipt of ECAM Autobrake and Flap Control warnings, the Flight Crew of an A320 performed all required QRH requirements and landed without incident.

As I attempted to taxi into position, I found it very difficult to do so even with centerline lights, due to overly bright Runway/approach lighting system in the displaced threshold area in which we were to line up and wait. While holding our position on Runway 10L I informed tower that the lights were too bright and that they were creating a safety hazard by washing  out our night vision. I did not mention this to the tower, but the lights also blocked most of our view of almost everything past the lights in the displaced threshold, so it wasn't possible to adequately scan any of the Runway beyond the displaced threshold prior to commencing the takeoff roll. In my opinion, had we  experienced a loss of thrust during the initial takeoff roll while at a high thrust setting and low airspeed,  I'm not so certain that I would have been able to successfully keep the jet on the Runway due to the bright  lights. A flight departing ahead of us also complained to tower about the overly bright lights as they were  holding in position from the full length of Runway 10L. According to the tower they are unable to place  aircraft in position to hold from an intersection at night, so for that reason they were placing aircraft into  position at the full length of Runway 10L. I do not understand why the tower can't dim the lights while an aircraft is holding on the Runway in the displaced threshold, and then turn them up again after the plane is past the approach lights in the displaced threshold, but according to the Tower they can't dim the lights  while an airplane is holding in position.				A B737 Captain reported that while taxiing into position PDX Runway 10L, Runway and Approach Light Systems lights were so bright that the remainder of the airport environment was obscured. Reportedly ATC was unable to reduce the brightness of the ALS.

As a rapid climbout was happening, the cabin altitude raised high enough to deploy the masks in the cabin before we could get back down below 10,000 FT. We were vectored back but were not slowed down and configured to land. Executed a go-around and were given vectors by the controllers back onto final. The weather was marginal VFR and maybe the controllers thought we could see the airport. There was confusion with ATC about how they wanted us back around. Discovered the bleeds were actually in the off position. Bleeds back on and feeling rushed around the pattern in a VFR/IFR situation while working checklist responses put me out of sync and forced another go-around. Third time around, emergency declared, Captain made the approach and landing. Requested EMS meet us at the gate as a precaution. Contributing Factors:1. Switches in this a/c opposite of my last airplane.2. Aircraft coming from the hangar.3. Checklist response (on a/c panel) 'set' Might be better if 'on'4. Controller and weather issues complicating a text-book return for landing.		[We were] climbing out with clearance to climb to 17,000. Passing 10,000, we got the cabin altitude Warning horn. We began the QRH procedure with a descent to 10,000, then 8,000. Aircraft climbed to nearly 14,000 in the transition and the passenger O2 masks deployed. After a delay in communications with the cabin, I verified that the masks had dropped and gave the number 1 Flight Attendant, the TEST for return.We were rushed in our vectored approach and executed a go around. On the subsequent downwind we 'discovered' the engine bleed switches were off. When we tried to reinstate them, condensation formed and created additional confusion in the cabin which required several more calls and PA's from me. Again, behind, I elected to go around. I declared an emergency at this time for handling and concerns over any possible passenger O2 issues with the extra delay in the air. Medical personnel were requested to meet the plane. Rest uneventful.Lessons: 1. 'Set' on the checklist can be too easy to say and then miss.2. Declare an emergency not only for aircraft issues, but also for priority handling.3. In our scenario, passing thru 10,000 in a good climb, this checklist does not really require an 'emergency descent' as the flight attendants were expecting. We calmly went to 10,000.4. Communication to and from the cabin was not easy with horn and masks.5. Re-establishing bleeds caused confusion in cabin and delays with us. No guidance on this.6. Poor sleep in hotel, with alarm going off 3 times may have contributed.7. Try to keep personal issues aside - tough.8. A/C possibly came from hangar overnight with the bleed switches off - not normal position, check hard in this scenario.9. Good check of cabin alt approaching 10,000 a must.		B737-800 flight crew experiences a cabin altitude warning horn passing 10,000 FT during climb. Before the aircraft can be leveled the passenger oxygen masks deploy. Rushed approaches result in two go arounds before an emergency is declared and a successful landing ensues. Engine bleeds were 'discovered' in the 'off' position.

Due to the critical phase of flight it was decided to focus on a safe landing first and trouble shoot the [problem on the ground. Landing was uneventful, we cleared the runway at the high speed turn off as planned. We determined that we had suffered a center system hydraulic failure. Captain had enough steering authority to safely clear the inboard runway and once we did so we taxied the minimum distance required to clear the E taxiway, parked and contacted company for a tow and secured engines. All irregular checklists were completed as applicable.  Tow in and parking were uneventful.

Other parameters [were] normal. [We] referred to Flight Manual, High Engine Vibration irregular. Requested lower altitude and turned on engine anti-ice thinking ice build up may have caused condition.  Able to stabilize indication/vibration less than 5.0 at FL310, .75 MACH. Captain communicated with Dispatch, Maintenance, flight attendants. [We] decided to declare emergency with Center intending to proceed direct to destination. Vibration indication appeared normal by approach phase below 10,000 FT. Normal approach, landing and rollout.		During cruise at FL350, engine 2 displayed 6.1 on the N1 vibration scale, and a pronounced aircraft vibration was detected through the flight control side-stick, tray table, and the cockpit floor. Engine 2 thrust was reduced to maintain a vibration level at or below 5.0 units. The high vibration irregular checklist was consulted for guidance. Decent to FL330 was requested to allow for an idle thrust application of engine heat. After determining the irregular procedure was not an adequate remedy, additional guidance was sought from Dispatch and Maintenance. The Maintenance Engine Controller downloaded our aircraft's engine parameter data, but no evidence of our vibration appeared from this effort. A diversion was considered prior to and during consultation with Dispatch and Maintenance, but ultimately deferred until our collaboration was complete. At the conclusion of our 'out-reach', however, we advised Dispatch that (due to the degradation) we planned to declare an emergency with ATC and request priority handling, since we were nearing the top of decent and this was our closest option in point of time.		A320 flight crew experienced high N1 vibration at FL350. Altering thrust and altitude along with engine anti-ice have little effect. An emergency was declared during descent but the vibration completely disappeared below 10,000 FT.

We briefed a departure from 1R and the SHEAD routing, including the altitude restrictions at MDDOG, TARRK, SHEAD, and DBIGE. We also briefed a company field and facilities notice regarding complying with altitude restrictions on the SHEAD7. In addition, we referenced an FDC NOTAM USD 01/242 for the SHEAD7 that reads, 'CROSS MDDOG AT 9,000 (ATC)/AT OR ABOVE 9,000. CROSS TARRK AT 11,000 (ATC)/AT OR ABOVE 11,000.' We interpreted this NOTAM as clarifying a minimum altitude at or above MDDOG and TARRK, since the chart only references an altitude for each intersection. The meaning of 'ATC' in the NOTAM was unknown to us. On departure from LAS climbing through 9,000, the LAS Departure Controller queried us about our altitude and told us to stop our climb and maintain 10,000. He stated that we should have leveled at 9,000 until MDDOG. We responded that we were planning to cross MDDOG at or above 9,000, referring to the FDC NOTAM 01/242. There was no traffic conflict in this instance. However, inbound arrivals to LAS from the south and west arrive in this area between 9,000 and 11,000 FT, so it had the potential for conflict. Cause, the wording in this FDC NOTAM is not clear. There is no explanation for the letters 'ATC' in the NOTAM. The company field and facilities does not refer specifically to the NOTAM, so there is confusion which directive applies. The previous day on a departure from LAS Runway 25R, upon check-in with Departure Control we immediately received an unrestricted climb to FL190. This is the clearance I have received in most of my departures from LAS. This clearance may have conditioned us to believe the hold down altitude of 9,000 at MDDOG was rarely used (or unnecessary). The 'at or above' wording in the NOTAM seems appropriate considering the rising terrain to the west of the airport. I believe that NOTAMs need to be written in plain English. Abbreviations and condensed wording can be misinterpreted and lead to mistakes. In this instance, the NOTAM is unnecessary, as the altitude crossing restrictions on the chart need to be applied; and if the altitude restrictions were unnecessary, ATC can offer an unrestricted climb.				Air Carrier departure from LAS noted confusion regarding the altitude restrictions listed on the SHEAD7 SID, indicating uncertainty between crossing restriction/s ATC vs. conventional.

We expected and briefed a fairly typical approach for MDW (ILS 31C circle-to-land 22L). We were established on the localizer and glideslope with the autopilot and auto-throttles engaged. We broke out just prior to the published circling minimums (1,620 FT). We had expected to circle much sooner (as per the ATIS) and were caught off guard. After passing the RUNTS intersection, the Tower Controller had advised that ATIS F was now current, but provided only the new altimeter setting. In my approach briefing earlier, I had explained that I would initiate the circling maneuver at flaps 5 at 1,500 FT AGL (2,100 FT MSL) unless requested otherwise by ATC. As we broke out, rain was falling. As I began the right turn to enter a left downwind, I commented that the weather was obviously much worse than expected, although the weather to the east and north appeared better (better visibility and higher ceiling). At this point, I looked down and noticed that I had allowed the aircraft to descend to approximately 1,400 FT MSL (as best as I can remember) at flaps 5. Our company has very strict and very clear guidelines concerning this. The aircraft must be fully configured for landing below 1,000 FT AGL, [but] we were not. I immediately applied power to climb back up to 1,000 FT AGL and configured the aircraft for landing. The remainder of the visual circling maneuver and landing were uneventful. My First Officer and I discussed and debriefed this approach while parked at the gate prior to the next flight.1) Better situational awareness on my part.2) Better approach briefing on my part, to include contingency plans if we do not break out on the approach at the expected location and altitude.3) The aircraft we flew was not equipped with a HUD. Without exception, I use the HUD from takeoff to exiting the runway after landing. I admitted to my First Officer prior to the first leg on this day that I felt 'naked' without it. The HUD is a great tool, especially for this sort of transition from an instrument approach to a visual circling maneuver. All the information is right there, whereas now I had to look down for airspeed, altitude, etc.4) I will make it a point to share this story with all my First Officers in the future when this particular approach is in effect at MDW.		Descended below 1,000 FT AGL while not in landing configuration. [Suggest] better callout by non-flying pilot.		B737 flight crew reports descending inadvertently below company circling minimums during the circle [to land] maneuver without the aircraft being fully configured. The ceiling encountered was at minimums and much lower than that reported by ATIS. A normal landing ensues.

But, I thought I'd talk about our landing. The weather was 600'/2 SM and light rain.  The runway was wet with no standing pools of water. The rollout was normal with good braking action for the first two thirds of the runway. We felt some degradation in the braking during the last 1000'. We exited the runway onto Taxiway K and had a normal taxi to the gate. We were asked to hold out of the ramp as it had just closed due to thunderstorms approaching the field. I gave a Field Condition Report and called the last 1000' as wet-fair. I contacted Dispatch and gave them the same information.		Two thirds of the way through the roll out, we were decelerating through 50 knots and the reverser's were completely stowed. At that point, we began to experience a loss of braking effectiveness and excessive activation of the anti-skid system. I was targeting Taxiway K for the turnoff and due to the lack of braking began to doubt whether we would make that taxiway. Slowing the aircraft was difficult. I believe this was due to the wet conditions on top of the rubber build-up from aircraft landing 31C more often than not. My one regret in the situation is that we did not make a verbal report of the braking condition directly to the Tower after clearing the runway. My desire to defer to the Captain on making that report was a factor as was the poor weather and uncommon taxi routing from 13C to the gate which diverted our attention.		A B737-700 Flight Crew reported that braking action on Runway 13C at MDW deteriorated in the last thousand feet due to wet conditions over the rubber deposits left be landing aircraft.

The Agent claimed that we had 90 wheelchair passengers on board the aircraft. It took longer than normal to get underway but we left the gate uneventfully. Just after we were airborne, there was a very strong odor in the cockpit that smelled like it was petroleum-based. We were cleaning up the aircraft and getting a frequency change and a climb to a higher altitude. I was getting ready to ask the Captain what he thought of the smell. At that time, we received a chime from the cabin, signaling an emergency. They had the same fumes in the cabin but no visible smoke. They stated that it was stronger toward the aft portion of the cabin. At that time, the Captain and I decided that we needed to get the aircraft back on the ground. We donned our oxygen masks and went about the getting back to the airport. I quickly ran the numbers for our weight and we determined that we could safely return despite being over max landing weight and having a wet runway. While I was on the radio trying to coordinate our return, the Captain started on the QRH procedure. He had some difficulty finding the correct section due to the fact that we were not thinking about looking in the Fire section because we just had fumes. The ATC frequency was very congested and it took a couple of minutes to get a word in with the Controller. We declared an emergency and they vectored us back. Because the runway was wet, we decided that we were just going to stop the aircraft straight ahead on the runway. The fumes seemed to dissipate as we got closer to landing. We landed uneventfully and had the airport Crash, Fire and Rescue Crew check the aircraft on the runway. We then proceeded to the gate. We were very fortunate that we did not have to evacuate the aircraft. With 2/3 of the plane being full of wheelchair passengers and half of the remaining passengers being elderly,it would have been a big problem. These flights have escorts that go along on the trip but I am pretty sure that they have no training in how to handle an emergency on the aircraft. I think they are just along to help on the ground. They are outnumbered by at least a four to one margin. In an emergency, they would be completely overwhelmed. We had outstanding Flight Attendants on this flight but I am sure that they would not be able to handle the situation. It would be physically impossible.		Upon commencement of our takeoff roll, a strong petroleum smell was evident in the cockpit. Shortly after getting airborne, we received a call from the Flight Attendants telling us of the same strong smell in the cabin. We donned our oxygen masks. The smell we were experiencing was definitely petroleum-based, but I did not think it was jet fuel fumes. While my First Officer was talking to ATC, I pulled out the QRH to proceed to the remaining steps for fumes in the cockpit/cabin, and at first, looked in the Air Systems tab. I didn't find what I was looking for, of course, because the procedure is under the tab named, Fires. I was momentarily delayed in finding the correct checklist page, I think, in part because we were not on fire, and that kind of delayed my efforts a little.Further information was now available from the cabin (smell was stronger in the aft cabin, and no evidence of fire was present), and after a quick check of the numbers, we elected to return. Back in the QRH with the correct checklist page now at hand, we proceeded to execute the steps. After reaching Step 10, we proceeded to the right decision tree column, and completed the first step (Equip Cooling Supply/Exhaust Switches (Both)-Alt). Some confusion then set in, because the next steps seemed to be concerned with an electrical malfunction as the source of the fumes, and our fumes were not electrical in nature. So we concentrated on landing the airplane, and didn't have time to switch packs and time for two minutes, etc. We got the airplane on deck and had the Crash and Rescue folks check the airplane out before clearing the runway. After being given the 'all clear' by the Crash and Rescue Team, we taxied to the gate.		B737 flight crew experiences a strong petroleum smell shortly after takeoff and elects to to return for and overweight landing. The passengers include elderly and wheel chairs. The crew believes that had an evacuation been necessary it would have been problematic.

The flight [plan] showed, 'KEWR DCT WHITE'. The PDC filed route showed 'KEWR WHITE'. The PDC remarks showed 'Newark Eight Departure'.We took off from Runway 22R and climbed out as called for by the SID expecting radar vectors for WHITE. Upon switching to Departure Control, we were cleared direct ELVAE. I read back the clearance, found the point on the departure procedure, typed it in the FMS and proceeded direct to the point. I then asked what the Controller would like us to do after ELVAE. He stated that it was on the SID plate and we needed to follow the guidance to COL then to WHITE.After much confusion, distraction (during a critical phase of flight) and numerous radio calls, we eventually flew to COL then onto WHITE. We also followed up with a phone call to the approach facility. The SID chart is confusing and the clearances are misleading. If we are cleared by ATC to ELVAE, they should follow that up with 'and fly the published routing to WHITE'. Everything we had indicated radar vectors to WHITE. The verbiage on the SID is unsafe and needs to be made crystal clear. The SID should also utilize transitions as they have in DEN and other airports.				When cleared KEWR WHITE after departing EWR, an A320 flight crew was confused by the 'ROUTING' format of the NEWARK 8 DEP chart. Attempts to seek clarification from ATC were rebuffed.

The breakers, all in a row, were Q41,Q42,Q43,Q44. These were the squibs for both engine fire systems. We contacted Maintenance via ACARS and after his research he determined the breakers had not tripped but had probably been left open after maintenance that occurred earlier in the morning. He asked that I use my authority to close the breakers and thus regain fire fighting ability for the engines. We did so. The breaker location is right near the edge of the panel. More or less right under your nose. I suppose several flights flew with these open.		I came back from using the lavatory. I happened to notice that four circuit breakers on the back panel were popped out. I was sure that I had checked the breakers before we left and that they all had been in. I guess it is possible that I just missed these.		An A320 crew found four fire extinguishing squib circuit breakers open in flight. The crew determined Maintenance had opened them earlier in the day and so using the Captain's emergency authority reset the breakers.

We departed a few minutes early. Forty- six minutes into the flight we received an ECAM HGD G RSVR LO LVL. We completed the appropriate check list. The check list had us shutdown the Green System. At that point the green reservoir showed just above empty. We notified Maintenance Control and Dispatch of the condition of the aircraft and asked them where they would like us to land as the aircraft was fine in flight; however performance of the aircraft was not sufficient to land at our destination. While we were awaiting the decision from Dispatch, as to our alternate, I informed the A Flight Attendant that we had a mechanical condition which would require a precautionary landing. I asked her to review her procedures and told her I would get back to her when we had more information. Dispatch and Maintenance suggested ZZZ2 as the alternate. I was against this as they had ninety degree cross winds gusting above twenty knots. With possibly no brakes and steering and loss of some flight controls I asked for a different airport. After going back and forth with Dispatch and Maintenance Control, it was decided that we would make a precautionary landing in ZZZ. The First Officer and I reviewed all of the procedures and decided, for performance, in case of a go around a flaps three landing was called for. Also, in reviewing Flight Operations Manual (F.O.M.), we decided that the aircraft situation was 'Urgent' and did not meet the definition of an Emergency. Therefore, an emergency was not declared. Approaching the top of descent point I called the A Flight Attendant and once again briefed her that a precautionary landing was being made and told her I would be making the announcement to the passengers in five minutes. I waited five minutes and read the precautionary landing announcement from the F.O.M. to the passengers. The ECAM procedure for the aircraft condition allowed for us to try and restore the Green System to lower the gear. We successfully attempted this procedure and lowered the gear. However, due to the small amount of hydraulic fluid remaining it was determined to not be safe to try and taxi to the gate. We landed on the runway and came to a stop. The fire crews inspected the aircraft and found a puddle of fluid under the left engine. The Maintenance crew came to the aircraft they requested and we delivered through the First Officer's window the gear pins. The Maintenance crew secured the gear and we were towed to the gate. It was found that the hydraulic pressure valve had blown an 'O' ring and was leaking fluid when under pressure.				After suffering the loss of the Green Hydraulic System an A320 flight crew opted to divert to an airport more suitable for landing with possibly compromised braking and or steering.

Here is the datalink clearance we received from Shanwick: CLRD TO [DESTINATION] VIA ATSIX RANDOM ROUTE 64N020W 68N030W 70N040W FM ATSIX/1118 MNTN F360 M083 ATC/LEVEL CHANGE ENTRY POINT CHANGE END OF MESSAGE. The problem with this clearance is that it doesn't go all the way to Edmonton airspace. In fact, it ends part way through Reykjavik airspace. Here is another example, CLRD TO [destination] VIA BALIX RANDOM ROUTE 65N020W 68N030W 70N040W FM BALIX/1449 MNTN F360 M084 END OF MESSAGE. Same issue; the clearance ends part way through Reykjavik airspace. More importantly, there is nothing on the datalink clearance to indicate that this is a partial clearance, or that further clearance must be requested or received from Reykjavik Control or Iceland Radio. It would seem a very easy task for Shanwick to add this bit of free text to clearances like these: REQUEST FURTHER CLEARANCE FROM XXXX. I've seen many clearances like this recently, and have personal knowledge that a call to Iceland Radio or Reykjavik Control will get the remainder of the clearance. However, I recently flew with a First Officer who was new to the Atlantic Random Routes and was diligently studying the FOM on how to get the clearance. It became apparent that this 'partial clearance' is not addressed in the FOM and that there was clear confusion on the First Officer's part that we did not in fact have a full clearance via datalink from Shanwick. It took nearly an hour from our initial contact with Iceland Radio, asking for further clearance, to the time we finally received it from Reykjavik Control. I think the true burden lies with Shanwick to pass this tidbit along, however perhaps the FOM should address it too.				B777 Captain reports routinely receiving only a partial random route clearance through Reykjavik airspace from Shanwick Control via data link and wonders why this is.

We carefully reviewed the NOTAMS, ATIS, departure page, 10-7 page, and the 10-3 page that describes the RNAV procedures at ATL. AFTER we were in position on the runway, the Tower cleared us for take off and added: 'Fly heading 295 at the marker.' We asked him to clarify and he just repeated the same thing. I asked him did he mean one of the markers for 8R. He said 'yes, the middle marker.' I informed him that we were assigned the CADIT RNAV. His answer was that they were doing triple parallel departures. We turned up our marker beacon audio (there are NO marker beacon lights on the Airbus) and departed. After takeoff I again reviewed all our paperwork and there is NO MENTION ANYWHERE OF THIS MARKER BEACON THING! One note on the 10-3 page says that if triple parallel departures are being conducted to expect a HEADING; NOTHING about a marker. If this is a standard departure, why isn't it in the 10-7 page or somewhere? It should be on the ATIS at least. Why didn't Ground Control warn us that we could expect it? We don't use the marker beacon audio on the Airbus so how do we know if it's going to work? Had we had some warning we could have set something up to identify the point.				An A320 Captain took umbrage at being cleared for the CADIT RNAV SID from Runway 26L at ATL and, when cleared for takeoff, was cleared to fly a 295 heading after the marker.

Upon passing 16,000 feet, the flying First Officer noticed the Left Engine Oil Quantity had gone to '0'. At that moment, we began to analyze the situation and contacted Dispatch to bring them into the loop. Within a few minutes, the pressure went to approximately 50 PSI. We ran the Irregular Procedure for Engine Oil Press checklist, shut the engine down and dumped fuel and landed with no further issues. One issue of concern that came up during this incident was with Dispatch. They were slow to respond with the appropriate information for our landing distance for a flaps 20 single-engine approach. Having this information readily available in an emergency situation is very important.		Passing through approximately FL160 I noticed the oil quantity indication for the left engine was 0. I pointed it out to the Captain and the 2 Relief Pilots. Initially there were no other abnormal engine indications, so we discussed the possibility of a faulty oil quantity indicator. During this discussion the left engine oil pressure started to slowly decrease. We requested to stop our climb at FL210 with ATC. We ran the electronic checklist for low oil pressure which requires an engine shut down. We requested landing performance data from Dispatch. Initially they sent the wrong data and it took several attempts to get the data we required.		A B777 oil quantity decreased to zero during the climb out followed by decreasing oil pressure and an Electronic Checklist indication to shut the engine down. An emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport single engine where oil was seen on the cowling.

We were at 6,000 FT 17 miles from the airport, so I slowed to 210 KTS. The Captain told me not to slow any further, so I maintained 210 during the subsequent descent to 3,000. Needless to say, I wound up high and fast. On final, we got one GPWS 'sink rate' callout, but the Captain said 'you're good, keep going' (or something similar). I had thought that I was too experienced to allow this to happen, but the Captain had been overriding my decisions the entire trip, and apparently, I just got tired of it. If I had said, 'let's go-around' would he have approved it? Clearly, he didn't want to go-around. So, what's a First Officer to do? When the Captain says maintain speed, at what point can I slow? When he says continue, may I go-around? Old questions; no answers. We should have gone around, but in these circumstances, is the flying pilot really flying the aircraft?				A320 First Officer reports slowing to 210 KTS during a visual approach and being told not to slow any further by the Captain. An unstabilized approach results and is continued to landing.

An 'event' happened on the Captain's side of the cockpit. I felt a liquid spray me and a loud noise. The Captain said, 'You have the aircraft.' My initial thought is that he got hit in the face and eyes with something and could not see and was relinquishing control of the aircraft to me. Since we were at a low speed, below 80 KTS, and there was tons of runway, I initiated an abort. When we slowed down, the Captain then took control of the aircraft and taxied it off of the runway. The event was the Captain's window opening. He did feel water hit him in the face and we have no idea what it was from. We exited off of the runway, ran the checklist, and went over the brake cooling. The Captain called Dispatch and made an Info-Only write-up in the logbook. We took off without incident to our next destination.I have no idea what caused his window to open. I do think he was surprised that I initiated the abort, as the Operations Manual states that the Captain has the ultimate authority to abort or not. I felt that at the instant he was relinquishing his command, as he told me to take the aircraft. I felt the safest thing to do was to abort under those circumstances. I feel that an action was better than no action. Also, there are places and times that going airborne and then taking care of the problem would be the proper solution.		On the takeoff roll, the Captain's window slid open and the takeoff was aborted.		B737 flight crew describes a rejected takeoff when the Captain's sliding window comes open at low speed and control is passed to the First Officer.

The autopilot never kicked off, although after the worst of the turbulence I turned it off myself to level the aircraft back up to the assigned altitude. We received no warnings or ECAM's; we were in VFR conditions; the radar never indicated any disturbance. We checked with the cabin crew and crew and passengers were OK, just shaken up.

Had the First Officer look at it and he had never seen it that high in the band before either. The First Officer called up Maintenance Control to discuss this indication. In the mean time, ATC told us that there would be moderate turbulence at FL410 ahead and recommended FL390 instead, so I asked for FL390 and just after we started out of FL410 we got the number 2 pack bleed trip light on. We followed the QRH on it, hit the reset button, light went out, we continued on to our destination and wrote up the 8.5 and the trip light up in the same write up.They worked on the problem for 2.5 hours doing this and that. We had a long discussion with the mechanics and Maintenance Control about the 8.5 PSI. They told us that the 8.5 was within acceptable limitations according to their books. So off we went on the next leg. We did not get a trip light this time; however the cabin differential was still showing 8.5 PSI. Not sure wither this was normal (based on Maintenance numbers, or our Flight Operations numbers with 8.35 being normal and at the base of the arc, and 9.1 being maximum for an NG) so we decided to wait till we got on the ground and would again ask Maintenance Control if in fact this 8.5 PSI was acceptable. After landing Maintenance AGAIN said that, based on the previous research and the write up that cleared our write up, the 8.5 PSI was normal and no write up was needed. I still questioned how that 8.5 PSI was 'normal' and volunteered to make the write up again. In the mean time, our aircraft was scheduled to block out after only 24 minutes after we arrived and there was a shift change going on within Maintenance. But I was again told that 'NO' the write up was not wanted as the 8.5 PSI was considered normal. Again, all of this happened with the oncoming Captain listening to the discussion. So off I went to go home. While on the crew bus, I got a call from Crew Scheduling saying that Maintenance wanted to talk with me on the issue. I had a long talk with Maintenance in the parking lot bus shelter, told them everything that I saw and knew. Since it now seemed to me that there was in fact something more then this is 'normal', I asked if this plane was still departing on time. That was when he informed me that no, this plane was going nowhere as it was grounded. Great! So I called the Base Chief Pilot, who told me he just came back from that gate with our plane. From what I understand, the oncoming maintenance shift decided that 8.5 PSI was indeed 'not normal', that they wanted to ground the aircraft, but refused to make the write up. As I was no longer there, the oncoming Captain was asked to [and agreed to] make the write up based on the discussions he had witnessed. This incident illustrates three problems. It is difficult dealing with what we as pilots, via our manuals, think is a limitation or not normal, when that is in conflict with what Maintenance thinks is a limitation or not normal. We make a write up because we think it is wrong, but Maintenance tells us that in their manuals or procedures it is acceptable. This happens all the time. And I did not want to make a write up if it was considered 'okay' and nothing would be done. Also, with the ever present 'got to get this flight out on time come hell or high water' attitude (note only 24 minutes between our block in and scheduled block out) everyone is 'rush, rush, rush' and 'lets do the minimum so we can get this thing out of here'. No time to think a problem through and do what is right. Finally, the fact that we were in the middle of a shift change and the outgoing Mechanics did not want to speak for the oncoming shift. And the oncoming guys sure had a different view point then the two previous shifts, since they ended up grounding the aircraft.				a B737-700 Captain expressed his concerns which resulted from a dispute with Maintenance about differences between published flight operations versus maintenance aircraft pressurization differential limits.

The RPM went low enough to drop the autothrottles, but not low enough for the generator to drop off the line.  We requested a descent as we may have lost an engine. The descent clearance was almost immediate.  When the throttles were retarded for the descent, the engine returned to normal operation.  We leveled at FL390 and ATC was told to standby while we contacted Dispatch. The First Officer ran the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall Checklist in the QRH.  Dispatch was contacted and the decision was made to divert to a nearby airport.  ATC was notified and a clearance to the divert airport was received. The flight attendants, who had been seated since the departure due to turbulence, were contacted and told that we had an engine malfunction, we would be diverting, and we were planning a normal approach and landing. They stated that they had heard the noise and that it had been loud in the forward cabin.  A PA announcement was made saying that we had an engine malfunction and that the safest course of action was a diversion to a nearby airport. We reviewed the QRH and discussed the engine failure in the landing configuration section should the engine again malfunction.  The decision was made to use a normal flap setting as at this time the engine was operating normally.  We prepared to land to the southwest at the divert airport.  The diversion checklist was reviewed and the landing altimeter was reset in the pressurization controller. Dispatch sent us a message verifying ZZZ as our destination which we agreed to via ACARS.  After the descent checklist, the flight attendants were again contacted and told the time to landing and that again it would be a normal approach and landing.  A PA announcement was made telling the time to landing as that this was a precautionary diversion and the approach and landing would be normal.  We landed and taxied to gate.  Passengers were deplaned and told that we would take the first terminator, due in an hour, and complete the trip to. Dispatch, Maintenance, and the Chief Pilot on duty were contacted via telephone.  A logbook entry was made outlining the event.  The pilots were removed from the remainder of the trip by Crew Scheduling and the flight attendants were to continue with the passengers. We talked to the flight attendants to be sure that they were comfortable to continue the trip.  ATC was very helpful arranging the turn and let down into the airport.  Dispatch was easily contacted and the decision was made to divert with minimal discussion.  We also contacted the station to let them know we were coming (Pre-ACARS, this would have been harder to do).  The First Officer was very helpful in having the QRH out and ready and being ahead of the developing situation.  Coordination between ATC, Dispatch, the diversion station, and the flight attendants made our job easier.		The aircraft appeared to have enough thrust with the number two engine to maintain altitude, however, the descent seemed prudent. I throttled back and began the descent. In the descent, we pulled out and reviewed the Engine Stall Checklist as that seemed to be most appropriate and reviewed the procedures. At that time, the engine re-lit and was working itself back to idle. No exceedances were noted throughout the event. The number one engine came back online and functioned normally throughout the descent and recovery to the nearby divert airport. After the engine stabilized, the Captain coordinated with Dispatch, Maintenance and the Chief on call. They concluded it would be prudent to recover at the nearest suitable field. The recovery was uneventful.		A B737-700's left engine flamed out but as a descent was begun and the thrust lever retarded it relit. The flight diverted to a nearby airport where the aircraft was removed from service.

Our clearance was an unrestricted climb to FL190. Our rate of climb was over 4,000 FPM. The weather was reported broken, which was accurate for the whole environment, but ahead of us it was overcast at about 11,000 FT. Departure called out traffic to us at approximately 12 o'clock and 10 miles. TCAS showed a target there with an altitude variation from our altitude of +37 (3,700 FT above our altitude of 9,000 FT). I replied that we were unable the visual due to a ceiling, but that we did have the terrain to the east in sight for a turn on course. There was no response to that radio call and the Controller immediately was busy talking to another aircraft. As the Captain flew the aircraft, I monitored the TCAS. The target was tracking toward us at 12 o'clock; we couldn't actually determine the aircraft's heading. I started to talk about the traffic to the Captain. He very quickly disengaged the autothrottles and selected a shallow climb in Vertical Speed (approximately 500-700 FPM). At the same time, we got a TCAS TA. After three to five seconds, radio traffic allowed me to query the Controller, 'Confirm Aircraft X is still cleared to FL190.'  He said 'Who?'  I repeated the call, this time saying, 'Confirm Aircraft X is still cleared to FL190 with the traffic at our 12 o'clock.'  He then gave us a 090 vector.  By that point, however, we had already merged with the TCAS target and had stayed below it (and avoided the RA) by stopping our climb of our own accord. I believe that without the TCAS and our own intervention, a loss of separation or mid-air collision would have occurred. Instead of just telling us about the traffic, I thought maybe the Controller should first give us an amended climb to 11,000 FT then tell us about the traffic.				A B737 NG departed on the RENO 4 with an unrestricted climb clearance to FL190 with traffic 12 O'clock and 10 miles. The crew took evasive action after ATC failed to provide avoidance vectors in an appropriate manner.

In both cases ATC eventually contacted us on 121.5 to tell us that they wanted us back on 133.5.  After the second time we started using the right side radio and monitored the left one.  All three pilots subsequently witnessed the left radio do it again (switch itself from 133.5 to 121.5).  We wrote the left radio up and continued flight uneventfully with the right side radio.		When I came up from my break, it took longer than usual for the First Officer and Relief Pilot to open the cockpit door. They said that Center has lost them but they got the frequencies straightened out. About 3 minutes after I got back in my seat Center came on Guard and requested that we come up on 133.5. I looked down at the number 1 COMM head and 121.5 was in the active position. We complied and contacted them on 133.5. Several minutes I looked down and 121.5 had moved to the active position on it's own. It had not been selected. We then used the number 3 radio for the rest of the flight without any problems. We watched the number 1 COMM head and during the descent it switched frequencies again without being touched. We wrote up the Number one COMM head in the maintenance logbook.		A B777's number one radio switched between the communication head's two selected frequencies uncommanded. ATC contacted the crew on 121.5 to tell them of the lost communications.

Rolling take off initiated, and during initial roll, approximately 40 KTS, the other carrier declared that he was going around. Tower communicated with them while we were accelerating. Several calls were made by the other carrier's go-around due to wind shear, and the Tower during pilot not flying's call out at 80 KTS. By the time the pilot flying and pilot not flying understood that Tower was canceling our takeoff clearance, we were pushing 90 KTS plus. Pilot flying elected to continue the take off and told pilot not flying to tell Tower 'unable.' Normal take off was completed. Tower gave a vector north for our aircraft and when switching us to Departure, apologized for the confusion. We switched, and later while up on Center, were informed to call TRACON upon arrival. Tower seemed confused as to what action to take after the other carrier initiated go-around. Takeoff cancellation/or full understanding of cancellation to pilot flying/pilot not flying just came too late to avoid a high speed abort. The Tower should have canceled our take off clearance immediately if the intention was to keep us on the ground during the other carrier go-around. Too much time had elapsed between Tower confirming the reason for the go-around and issuing a take off cancellation. ATC may want to ensure that enough time and space exists to account for an aircraft initiating a go-around inside 3 miles or on short final and clearing or subsequently canceling a takeoff clearance.		After being cleared for take off, with a heavy on a three-mile final, Tower cleared the heavy to land. The pilot advised the Tower they were going around. Tower than canceled our takeoff clearance. We were well above 80 KTS and approaching 100 KTS with a 129 V1 speed. I instructed my First Officer to advise Tower that we were unable, and elected to continue the take off, instead of performing a high speed abort. Tower asked the other carrier why they were going around and his answer was that they received a windshear alert. Tower handed us off to Departure Control and we were later instructed to contact TRACON upon landing. After contacting the TRACON Supervisor, he thought the safer action would have been to abort. I explained to him why I thought otherwise. He understood my reasoning and acknowledged my Captain's authority to continue. He also informed me that at no time were there any separation issues with the heavy. Do not cancel takeoff clearances with an aircraft on the roll unless there is imminent danger of loss of life or aircraft damage. In those cases, I think the command should be Company # ABORT, not Company # cancel your takeoff clearance.		Air Carrier continued takeoff after ATC issued a 'Cancel Takeoff Clearance', the reporter noting their speed prohibited any abort action, adding ATC's phraseology was less than clear, suggesting the phrase ABORT be used in this type of circumstance.

The failure was accompanied by a loud bang audible in the cockpit, and a slight left yawing moment. N1 went to 13 percent; all remaining indications went to zero (0). No indications of fire or seizure were present. Captain was flying the aircraft. Upon indications of failure, First Officer pulled out the QRH, and ran the following checklists while Captain turned the aircraft direct back to the airport. First checklist run was the Engine/Failure Shutdown checklist. Steps 1-9 were completed, no driftdown was required and no restart was attempted. To configure for landing, Captain called for the One Engine Inoperative Checklist. This was completed and the aircraft was configured flaps 15 for landing. Captain maneuvered the aircraft for a straight-in approach. First Officer coordinated with Approach, then Tower for the approach. First Officer alerted passengers and flight attendants to the situation and directed all in the cabin to remain seated with their seatbelts fastened through approach, landing, and rollout. First Officer requested emergency vehicles upon arrival and declared an emergency via 7700 and voice. Flight crew configured for a flaps 15 approach however, target speed appeared to be to slow at 135 KTS. Captain decided to maintain a target speed of 150 KTS on final. Crew landed the aircraft without further incident. Fire Rescue Crew cleared the aircraft of any fire hazard and the Captain elected to taxi to the gate on the right engine. Maintenance and Customer Service met the aircraft at gate. Incidental failure of critical engine part. Examine current change schedule of this part to ensure adequate service life through current schedule.				B737 First Officer reports an engine failure climbing out of 4,300 FT. An emergency is declared, the engine is shut down, and the flight returns to departure airport. The calculated approach speed of 135 KTS is deemed too low by the Captain and 150 KTS is used for approach.

As we entered some remaining moisture from a dying downwind cell (looked like a thumb print on radar, not fully colored in and only green spotty), we began to see St. Elmo's fire and the radios got loud with static. In about a minute the radios were completely unreadable. We advised ATC of static and that they were very unreadable. We could faintly hear their reply. We were on a heading of about 130 and advised in the blind. We also broadcast on 121.5 and sent a text to Dispatch. The loss of radios lasted about 5 minutes or so where the radios were severely loud and unreadable! There was another aircraft, I believe an A340 that was 1,000 FT below us within a few miles that ATC had alerted us on. The concern is that radios should not fail so badly in moisture and conditions we were in as I have been in similar conditions hundreds of times without any failures or such static. I have also been in light moisture (green return no cells) conditions and experienced static and wrote the radios up to maintenance. They advise the antenna casing gets cracks and allows moisture to get in thus static is created. Note both radios (Captain/First Officer) had the same problem on different frequencies. This was a very disconcerting and unsafe event, especially with multiple airplanes deviating, vectoring, and switching altitudes for thunderstorm avoidance.				A320 Captain describes loud static in the radios while deviating around thunderstorms, making communication impossible.

We asked them to verify the kind of smell and they said it was not like electrical smell, but it smelled like burnt popcorn. The First Officer was communicating with them, so I asked him to have the jumpseating commuter pilot to verify the smell. The jumpseater verified that there was a burning smell, and all of them verified there was no smoke associated with the smell. I asked ATC for expeditious handling since both the First Officer and I did not perceive this as an emergency situation. We just did not want a long downwind to final. ATC apparently declared an emergency for us and assigned us Runway 7. After acquiring the field ATC cleared us for a visual to Runway 7. The Approach, landing and taxi in were uneventful. Emergency response vehicles met the aircraft and followed us to the gate.		Passing FL250 got a call from a Flight Attendant that there was an odor near row 25, smelled like burned popcorn. After landing I called Flight Attendant who told me odor had dissipated, no longer smelled. We taxied to the gate		An A320 Flight Attendant reported a burnt popcorn smell around row 25 as the aircraft began its descent for landing. The flight was expedited to the airport, ATC declared an emergency and after a normal landing the smell dissipated.

We were cleared to cross HIRMO at 3000', but were still at 4200'. Why?I stated that we were completely unable to cross at 3000' and the fixes were all published as 'above,' hence the slow descent. No more comment from NorCal. I don't think ATC realizes that we cannot modify fixes except for speeds once we are inside the IAF (HIRMO). A following aircraft chimed in that they were also unable to cross HIRMO at 3000', but no reply from ATC.		...we should have advised them immediately that we would be unable to make the HIRMO restriction.		After being cleared for the RNAV (RNP) Z Runway 11 approach to OAK, a B737-700 flight crew was unable to comply with a subsequent clearance to cross the IF (HIRMO) at 3,000 MSL but failed to advise Approach Control. A separation issue may have ensued although ATC did not pursue the issue short of bringing it to the the attention of the flight crew.

We talked at length about load, thrust rating, flap setting at the gate. We pushed and were at the hold point with brakes set. Captain called for flaps and I inadvertently set to 1 instead of 5. Five was in FMS and on the plan. I briefed the plan to Captain, but since it was pulled from ACARS, missed the flaps verification I usually do. When running the mechanical checklist, apparently flipped the flaps switch at the same time as takeoff data and bugs because neither the Captain nor I remember responding to it (after the event). We were not rushed at all, but it was my first time into SNA. On climbout, I called for flaps 1 and we both realized that we had taken off with flaps 1 27K instead of flaps 5. We didn't notice an unusually long takeoff roll. An unrelated event after the fact was there was a soaring bird over the runway about 100 FT that we had to shallow the climb to avoid hitting.		We theorize the First Officer inadvertently hit the toggle switch with the takeoff data and bugs item. Both pilots got good sleep the night prior. There was some confusion with the cabin crew prior to the before starting engine checklist about video. There was some confusion with the departure plan which caused me to call the load planner twice prior to departure to clarify takeoff data. [We] had to speak to supervisor. Both pilots were aware of critical field length. No rush on taxi/before takeoff checklist. All procedures were followed and call-outs made. The Before Start Checklist was completed prior to aircraft movement after pushback, I think. Weight was important so both pilots were vigilant. I have no explanation for how this occurred other than a mistaken finger movement with the mechanical checklist and a failure to crosscheck outside of the normal checklist flow. When scanning the flap indicator prior to takeoff I seem to remember seeing the green light, but not focusing on the indicator.		B737 flight crew reports planning a flaps 5 deaprture from SNA and inadvertently setting flaps 1. This is not discovered until the First Officer calls for flaps 1 after takeoff and found to be already there.

When we got to the point of the checklist that said 'recall' we found a 'Pack Trip Off' light illuminated. We stopped at that point and completed the QRH checklist for that item with no further problems. Because of this distraction we failed to complete the next step at the gate that called for 'Flaps' which should have been set to '1'. During the taxi out we completed the 'Before Takeoff Checklist' which called for 'Flaps and Takeoff Warning' and I witnessed the Captain push the throttles forward without any warnings. We both failed to check the flap indicator for some reason (I still do not understand how I missed that because I always do check the flap indicator at this time). We were advised to take the runway and 'line up and wait'. We were then cleared to takeoff and that is when the Captain pushed the throttle up for takeoff. As he did that we got the 'Takeoff Configuration Warning Horn' at which time we aborted the takeoff immediately. Tower was advised and they cleared us up to the next intersection to exit runway. After we exited the runway we did the 'After Landing Checklist' and then went back to check the entire checklist to make sure everything was completed and that is when we put the flaps to '1' and completed the 'Before Takeoff Checklist' and got back in line for takeoff. No other issues after that. Just need to make sure to check the flaps indicator every time. I do this all the time and I just do not know how I missed it this time. I have a flow that I use to check the takeoff page for flap setting, flap indicator and the actual flap handle to make sure they are all in the right location or setting. I still just don't know how we missed this. I am a pilot that uses the checklist every time and never thought I would miss something like this. I just can't believe I let this happen. It will never let this happen again because I will make it a priority even more so now.				A B737-700 First Officer reported that because his Before Taxi task flow was interrupted he failed to extend the flaps so when the thrust levers were advanced for takeoff the Takeoff Warning Horn sounded and the Captain rejected the takeoff.

The First Officer set flex thrust for takeoff and the aircraft veered left of centerline. The First Officer corrected with almost full right rudder. We then received an ECAM and I took control of the aircraft and aborted the takeoff. We were approximately 65 KTS when I began the abort. The auto brakes did engage as the aircraft continued a slight acceleration during the abort and the aircraft was stopped using max auto brakes. I taxied clear of the runway, shut down the number two engine and called Dispatch.

Communicating with the flight attendants, we were told that there were reports of flames out of the exhaust of the number one engine. A deadheading Captain was asked to take a look to see if he could observe any damage. He could not. We then asked if he would come up to the cockpit to assist the First Officer and I. ATC was advised of the situation, an emergency was declared, and we asked for the equipment to be rolled. After completing the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall Checklist, we decided to do a precautionary shutdown of the number one engine. Though the engine gauges were apparently reading normal, the number one EGT was approximately 70 - 80 degrees higher than the number two EGT at flight idle. Pushing the number one throttle up even a couple of inches caused the EGT to approach almost 600 degrees. Based on this and our interpretation of the checklist, we decided to go ahead and secure the number one engine and to do a single-engine approach and landing. ATC vectored us in for the ILS. We completed all the necessary checklists and configured for a flaps 15 landing. The approach, landing, and rollout were uneventful. Taxiing off the runway the Ground Crew in the fire trucks examined the number one engine, determining that there wasn't any evidence indicating a fire and the decision was made to continue to the gate and disembark. In conclusion I have to say that this was truly a team effort. Without the First Officer and deadheading Captain's help the situation at hand would have been considerably more demanding.		The Captain was flying during descent out of approximately FL280 when we heard three loud bangs from the number one engine with aircraft yaw. The Flight Attendant called the flight deck and stated numerous passengers reported seeing flames coming from the number one engine tailpipe during the bangs. Only abnormal engine indication is significantly higher EGT from the number one engine compared to the number two engine. We ran the memory items and checklist for Engine Limit/Surge/Stall. A Captain riding in the passenger cabin came to the cockpit and sat on the jump seat and assisted us. The Captain elected, and I agreed, to do a precautionary engine shutdown. We declared an emergency with ATC. We accomplished the Engine Shutdown and One Engine Inoperable Landing Checklist. The Captain landed on one engine with the equipment standing by. The Fire Department reported no visible damage or 'hot spots' on the number one engine. The Fire Department followed the aircraft to the gate where passengers deplaned normally.		B737 flight crew reported apparent compressor stalls during descent for landing. The crew elects to shut down the engine due to indications of damage and lands safely at destination airport.

No reference action associated. The Flight Manual was referenced and indicated no number 2 thrust reverser would be available (checklist was a little confusing). We could not find a weight penalty associated. Called Dispatch and they informed me that there was a weight penalty and that the required landing distance was only two hundred feet short of the entire runway length available at SNA. We have a system fault reset in our book that is applicable on the ground but not in flight. Maintenance said that we could cycle the Circuit Breaker (CB) in the air, but obviously, as we already were aware, this constitutes using Captain's emergency authority. I did not deem this an emergency from the information I had as it appeared to be only an issue with the runway length in SNA (checklist again very lacking in complete systems lost). Dispatch, Maintenance and I conferred and I decided that with the information I had at this point going to LAX (our designated alternate) would be a suitable safe option and make the stopping distance a non issue. I realized we still had 2.5 hours or so to consider our options. I still wanted the MEL information. I wanted all possible information, so I asked Dispatch to have the MEL for the issue to be sent to the aircraft. Upon receiving the MEL it was quite lengthy, involved numerous items lost once on the ground (reference MEL for LGCIU2 inoperative). With this further information, I determined that no matter where we landed that the situation would have negative consequences on safety, even just taxiing in at our destination. With this in mind, and after getting assurance from Maintenance that there were no additional consequences that would be generated by cycling the LGCIU 2 CB I opted to use my Captain's emergency authority and did so. The CB was uneventfully cycled, the system was fully recovered, and we opted to continue to our original destination of SNA. As a caveat I can only assume that the cycling of CBs in flight being deemed a use of Captains Emergency Authority was generated with some specific instances in mind. The criteria is entirely too broad. This was a simple reset procedure that should not have required me to judge whether to use this authority or not. I feel the emergency authority to recycle CBs in flight designation should be reviewed. As pilots it appears to be a simple, obvious procedure in this instance that generated a gray area for us to operate in. I understand that there are CBs that influence numerous systems. This CB just dealt with LGCIU 2 which was inoperative already with the commensurate repercussions. The entire legality exercise was wholly unnecessary.				A320 Captain experiences an LGCIU 2 ECAM at FL380 and learns that this failure will render the number 2 thrust reverser inoperative. The destination runway is short and Maintenance offers a circuit breaker reset procedure if the Captain elects to exercise his emergency authority. This is successfully accomplished.

This triggered a 'Buffer Alert' on the FMC screen. The FMC then tried to slow the speed. We intervened and disconnected the auto throttles and managed the speed. On the VNAV cruise page the max altitude dropped from 39,700 FT to 37,100 FT. We were deviating to the east for a storm. Our ride was smooth throughout with ripples of chop. We also turned on the anti ice as the SAT had now changed from -51 degrees to -28 degrees and we were IMC. While [we were] staring at the FMC all temperatures returned to normal. We re-engaged the auto throttles and observed all inputs. A few minutes later it happened again. The Captain requested lower and we descended to FL340. The Captain made a report to ATC to pass on to traffic in the vicinity and sent Dispatch a detailed message. Flight continued safely to destination.		[We were in] IMC deviating around random cells [with] high altitude clouds, 141,000 LBS, approximately 20 NM east southeast of FORRK, temperatures [were] between -46 to -49C (ISA +8 to +11). [We had an] optimum altitude approximately 38,100, maximum altitude approximately 39,700, mach .78. FMC alert lit up on the instrument panel at the same time the speed bug dropped and power was reduced. FMC scratch pad said 'Buffet Alert.' Advised First Officer to 'turn the auto throttles OFF, we need .78,' First Officer disengaged auto throttles and advanced power to the CONT. Checked VNAV CRZ page and our altitude capability read 371/371 (a drop of approximately 1,000 FT/2,600 FT (Optimum/Maximum) with a commanded Mach of .745. Prog 2/2 showed ISA deviation of +25 (-32C) and increasing. First Officer saw -32C and said 'we need engine anti-ice' and selected engine anti-ice on (very good call by First Officer). Temperature increased to ISA +28/-29C. Attempted contact with MIA Center but were unable to hear them due to static. Checked ND for any conflicting traffic in the event we were unable to maintain speed and/or altitude or experienced airframe buffet. Aircraft was holding speed and altitude with no buffet. Entire event lasted 30-60 seconds. VNAV CRZ page now showed xxx/397 and temperature dropped to a much lower temp (forgot what it was) and it was over. Advised MIA Center of temperature change problem and that they should advise other aircraft of the temperature change. Nothing against the Controller but from her voice it didn't sound like she understood the severity of the problem. I believe I made two calls trying to explain the result/risk. A flight on frequency asked the Controller a question about the event. After MIA replied I gave a second PIREP advising that we'd lost over 2,000 FT of maximum altitude capability. Then it happened again. Temperature this time reached ISA +29 (-28C at FL 380!). Optimum/maximum altitude was 367/367. We coordinated immediate descent to FL340/360; time for both events maybe 5 minutes. First event, normal conditions, second event smooth or at worst occasional light chop, the entire time. Sent messages to Dispatch advising them of event and recommended a heads up to advise other flights and to flight plan at least 2,000 FT under maximum altitude. That was a mental math mistake as our maximum altitude capability dropped approximately 3,000 FT-3,100 FT.		B737-800 flight crew experiences a rapid temperature increase of 21 degrees at FL380 causing a buffet alert and thrust reduction. Thrust is manually controlled to maintain Mach .78 and a few minutes the temperature returns to its' previous indication. After a couple of minutes the temperature increases again and the crew requests to descend to FL340 for the remainder of the flight.

I am a new Captain (under 300 hours) and my First Officer is a new hire on his third trip off IOE (Initial Operating Experience). As such I was very deliberate in doing the checklist and checked all takeoff data before leaving the ramp. All takeoff data checked ok with a reduced 26 KT power setting and a takeoff power setting of 97% N1. We closed out 1,400 LBS lighter then planned. Once cleared on to position and hold I taxied the aircraft onto the runway, set the parking brake and waited for landing traffic to clear the intersection. Given takeoff clearance I stood the throttles up to 40% N1, waited for them to stabilize, pressed TOGA, engaging the autothrottle. I then continued to advance the throttle manually for a faster spool up due to the short runway. Satisfied with the engines, I released the brakes and continued the takeoff roll. With about 2,000 FT of runway remaining I still had not reached V1 and Vr and was unhappy with my acceleration. I advanced the power manually, reached Vr and brought the aircraft into the air. The ILS antennas on the far end of the runway became abnormally large in the windscreen, however we successfully cleared them. I would estimate by inches not feet. Once at a safe altitude I discussed the event with my new First Officer and assured him this was not a normal takeoff. I asked what he saw and he pointed out the power setting had only reached 90-91% N1 during the takeoff roll when commanded setting was to be 97%. It is my firm belief that had I not added more power during the last 2,000 FT there would be much more to tell about this story. I am trying to figure out why the autothrottle did not capture the full takeoff power setting. I had confirmed the commanded setting of 97% several times on the FMC takeoff page during taxi out. I watched the power advance but missed the fact it didn't reach the full 97% as I had transitioned most of my attention outside. Now having time to reflect back; in the recent past the Flight Department issued a message that the autothrottles should be engaged at 40% N1 and let alone to advance the throttle by themselves. It was my understanding this procedure was to allow for a smooth spool up of the engines and lessen pilot workload. Is it possible that the manual advancement of the throttle beyond the 40% may have disrupted the auto throttle logic? If so, an emphasis should be placed on the dangers of this technique.				B737 Captain reports discovering late in the takeoff roll that the autothrottles have not achieved planned takeoff N1. Thrust is increased and the aircraft barely clears obstacles at the far end of the runway.

Weather was low ceiling and limited visibility so we had briefed, and were executing an HGS [Head up Guidance System] Cat III approach. Aircraft was high on downwind and early base turn was directed by ATC. I had landing gear extended and slowed to extend flaps to twenty five. ATC queried several times if we would be able to 'get down.' Our response was that we would continue trying. After localizer intercept, we determined that we would likely be configured and stable no later then FAF 'OPVEE.' HGS CAT III mode was acquired and we continued approach past OPVEE expecting to acquire runway visually at 300 FT AGL. [At] approximately 800 FT AGL, SEA Tower issued us a low altitude warning and to immediately check our altitude. As we were still IMC, I commanded and executed a missed approach to sort out any anomaly at a safe altitude. All aircraft instruments and systems indicated normal, i.e. current altimeter setting, local frequencies, etc.  No flags or aural warnings were activated on aircraft. We were vectored for, and executed a second CAT III approach to 16R and happily intercepted glide slope from below, achieving an uneventful landing on 16R. [This missed approach was caused by] ATC directing aircraft to stay too high, keep approach speeds too fast and turning base leg too soon during low weather approaches.				B737 Captain reports being high and fast during CAT III ILS to Runway 16R using HGS. While attempting to intercept the glideslope the Tower issues a low altitude warning and the crew goes around.

When he left, she informed me that the lights on her FA panel and the FA aft panel had 'been flickering on and off like crazy.' She asked if this was serious because this airplane (the Airbus) has a lot of electrical problems. I told her that it is something we need to look at so I need to know exactly what is going on. As we were talking I pulled up the electrical page to look for any abnormalities in the electrical system. All indications were normal. I told her when I step back to use the restroom I will look at the lights she is talking about to assess them. I put in a call to Dispatch thru the ACARS so that I could speak to both Dispatch and Maintenance Control about what the FA was reporting.I told her I would watch for the cycle she was talking about. When I used the facility, I cycled the lock a few times to see if there was any issue with the lights in the lav. They functioned normally. When I stepped out of the lav, I said the 'A' FA had reported the panel lights in the forward and aft galley had been flickering on and off and asked if that is what he was seeing in the aft galley area as well. He said yes, they were doing the same thing back there. I turned to the FA panel (near door 1L) to look for any failure lights, put my hand on the panel and asked him to confirm that they were getting the flickering lights on their FA panels. He said yes again.I got a hold of Dispatch and we got patched through to Maintenance Control. I told Maintenance Control what the FA had been reporting and relayed to him the length of time she had said the lights had been flickering. [He] did some research in his manual and referenced the page on generator shorting. I also had the manual out to that page. He said we could have that situation. I told him that all our electrical indications were normal and we had no display blanking issues or ECAMS. Maintenance Control said that we could have normal indications, but one of the symptoms is cabin lighting blinking issues. He referenced his manual and the bulletin that had come out about that. He said that they had done some maintenance on the #2 generator in May and it could be a shorting on that connector. I asked him what he suggested as I was showing all normal indications. He said, using Captain's emergency authority, he suggested disconnecting the #2 CSD. Let me point out that Maintenance Control was very through in his explanation and we had a good discussion about the situation. With Dispatch on the radio, I told him that if we were talking about taking a generator off line that we were not continuing onto destination and we needed to look at coming into ZZZ1 as we were about 100 miles out of ZZZ1. They both concurred since the weather in the destination area was bad and if there was an issue with the generator, they wanted to have the jet looked at. He asked if there were any failure lights on the FA panel or any ECAMS. I said, 'No ECAMS, but let me verify with the FA one more time.' I called the 'A' FA and asked her. She confirmed they had no failure lights. Maintenance Control suggested it was best to get the jet looked at given the similar issues on the fleet with generator problems. I concurred. I briefed FO on the conversation and said we were going to ZZZ1. He told ATC while I briefed the flight attendants and passengers. I asked FO to get lower so that I could start the APU so we could set up to take the #2 generator off line. We were going to set up to do so and I had the check list out. The FO and I discussed the taking the #2 generator off line. Neither of us were certain there was a short going on, but we did not want to disregard Maintenance's advice. We determined the most prudent course of action was to set up to take the generator off line, checklist out, but since we were so close to ZZZ1 (now below 21,000FT with the APU running and less than 60 miles to ZZZ1) we would keep the configuration as is and land. We had all checklists complete, routing in the box, announcements made to the passengers, and briefed the FA's. She asked if I had reset the generator as the lights had stopped flashing. I said no, we had not reset anything. She then said, 'Well it [was] only the reading lights above her galley area.' I stopped and asked her to confirm this change. I told her she had stated to me several times the lights on the FA panels in the forward and aft galley had been flickering on and off like crazy. She said she used the wrong terminology and it was the overhead reading lights not the panel. I asked her if that was the same in the aft galley. She said yes.I called Dispatch right away and conveyed that the FA's were now reporting that she used the incorrect terminology; it was not any of the panels but the overhead reading lights in the forward and aft FA area. I told him we wanted to continue to destination if he was good with that. He said he was, but that destination was now in a hold due to severe weather that built just to the west of the airport and ZZZ2 was ground stopped and asked about our fuel situation. I asked him what the burn was to destination. He said 8,000 [LBS]. We currently had less than 16,000 [LBS] on board and we were just west of ZZZ1. We determined with the burn, landing fuel, fuel for alt, [that] we had no hold fuel. We discussed the fuel and concurred we needed to land in ZZZ1 and get more fuel.Before we took off again, I spoke with the 'A' FA. She said that the lights had been flickering like crazy, but she had mistakenly said it was the lights on the FA panels. She said she had spoken to the aft FA and asked him if he had said anything that lead to the miscommunication. She said he told her that when I touched the FA panel (to verify what was happening and make sure I understood what areas they were speaking of) he had said those were the lights on the panel, but did not mean to indicate those were the lights that were flashing.				A miscommunication between an A320 Captain and the 'A' Flight Attendant lead the Captain to believe that a generator arcing event may be occurring and a diversion for maintenance is planned. Before landing the miscommunication is cleared up but destination weather and fuel remaining make the diversion necessary.

We entered holding and started the fuel dump to 600,000 LBS. We proceeded to do the generator drive R checklist.  The Captain did a PA and advised the flight attendants to prepare for a possible ground evacuation. We checked the charts for landing distance and go-around performance. We then did the overweight landing checklist  We  exited holding, asked for the equipment to be standing by and performed an uneventful overweight landing. CFR performed a visual inspection of the landing gear and brakes and found no signs of damage or overheating.  We monitored the brake temperatures and taxied to a hardstand without incident.		We got out our planned emergency checklists and waited for the Purser to begin the appropriate PA. Several minutes passed and no PA. The Purser was busy briefing her passengers/assistants as to what they will do if we in fact have to evacuate. She finally understood that she needed to be reading the PA. By the time that was finished, we didn't have time to brief our passengers/assistants for their respective exits. We landed shortly after without incident and no evacuation was necessary.		A B777 dumped fuel and returned to its departure airport when the right generator failed minutes after takeoff.

I reduced the power and it was not slowing down so I reduced the power to idle.  As soon as we got out of the overspeed we encountered more turbulence and the stick shaker activated and disengaged the AP.  I increased to full power and pushed nose down.  Were about 500 feet below 410 when we requested and received clearance for 390.   The engines would not spool up, it took a good 45 seconds.  Approaching 390 we decided to request 370 because it the engines were still not spooled up.  We were given 370 and a 15 degree turn for traffic.		Our optimal altitude was FL400, within limits.I have seen this scenario many times and have never had to make a descent without clearance until today. The only change I can think of making is asking for lower altitude faster to prevent the deviation. The entire event took place over a period of about 90 seconds.		A B737-700, flying slightly above their 'optimum' altitude, encountered turbulence that consecutively oversped and then slowed the aircraft to and below stick shaker airspeed necessitating a descent to a lower altitude to recover.  The slow acceleration of the engines from idle contributed to the prolonged recovery.

I took control and chose to stop on the runway and asked my First Officer to call the Tower and roll the equipment so that we could be inspected, since at this point we were not sure of what had occurred. Upon setting the brakes and shutting the engines down, I asked Tower to notify me when the 'men and equipment' were approaching so that I could ensure the area was clear and the engines had been shut down.After stopping the aircraft, we also notified Maintenance and Operations, since we would need a tug to take us from the runway to the gate. Since they were the only ones to arrive, we worked with them to ensure all was safe, we raised the flaps, Maintenance installed the gear pins and we were pulled off the runway and into the gate.After I completed my duties and entered the discrepancy into the maintenance log, I phoned Dispatch to discuss the fact that airport Fire and Rescue never responded to our request. The cause of this event has to be a miscommunication between us and the Tower Controller. As I took control of the aircraft and asked my First Officer to inform the Tower to 'roll the equipment,' I turned my attention to stopping the aircraft safely on [the] runway, making a PA to 'remain seated,' calling the flight attendants to ask them about any smell in the cabin and to see how the passengers were reacting. I am certain that both pilots believed the request for AFR had been made. I also thought my questions/statements about the aircraft being safe for the 'men and equipment' to approach were done in a manner that indicated I believed AFR was on the way.Dispatch, who phoned the Tower to ask why they didn't respond, advised their comment was that we never made the request. Fortunately, we didn't need their assistance, but I have learned from the event that next time I want the AFR to respond, I will ensure that we state so clearly and without question.				After stopping on the runway in response to a braking anomaly, the flight crew of a B737NG were concerned when their request for CFR response was not responded to. The Tower advised they had not received the request.

Pilot flying put 12,000 at RIICE in FMC and pushed for managed descent. Pilot not flying confirmed entry and pilot flying also checked Prog page, which showed below required path. The pilot flying thought the FMC was handling the descent properly and briefed the approach to Runway 27. When 12 NM from RIICE, pilot flying realized there was still 10,000 FT to descend to cross RIICE at 12,000. Pilot flying directed pilot not flying to tell ATC that we would not make the crossing altitude at RIICE. ATC responded to do the best possible. Soon thereafter, ATC gave a frequency change and new controller gave a descent to 7,000. The aircraft crossed RIICE at approximately 14,000 and continued descending to 7,000. The remainder of the approach and landing was uneventful. Neither pilot flying nor pilot not flying could figure out how the altitude constraint was not met by the FMC when originally all indicators looked good. There was a distraction by being given an unexpected runway while descending. The briefing, although fairly short, was enough to divert attention long enough to loose situational awareness concerning the crossing restriction.				A320 Captain reports missing a crossing restriction descending into IAH. The crossing restriction had been entered into the FMGC and a managed descent initiated. A runway change was entered during the descent.

I discussed diversion options with the First Officer. Shortly Flight Attendant advised me that the extinguisher did not put out the sparks and were deploying the second extinguisher. I declared an emergency with ATC and advised them that we needed to divert. I ran the smoke fumes fire QRH while the First Officer flew the aircraft. I spoke with Flight Attendant several times as she advised that the sparks did not subside. I told her the time to land and to prep for evacuation but would check in again with her. I notified Dispatch via ACARS that we were diverting and to have fire and rescue ready. Flight Attendant advised that there were still sparks but not as bad. We landed and taxied clear of the runway. Flight Attendant informed me that the sparks had stopped so I elected to taxi to gate and deplane via jetbridge. Passengers were deplaned quickly without there bags. Fire and rescue found a bare wire under the seat that was wet and appeared to be the cause. We had to totally power down the aircraft to get the sparks to completely stop.		Flight Attendant called back with more details: electric sparks flying in emergency exit row. Captain made decision to divert; by then we were 64 NM west of the divert airport. Captain declared emergency with ATC. ATC initially slow to react then gave us direct to the airport and lower. I was flying aircraft, started descent, input direct to the airport, and then changed destination, descended at 320 KTS with full speed brakes. Captain was busy coordinating with ATC, Dispatch, and cabin, ran 'smoke/fire/fumes' QRH, and got ATIS. I told ATC we would land XXR, input landing data, activate and confirm, kept speed at 320 KTS with full speedbrakes to 3,000 FT, then slowed and configured aircraft. Approach did excellent job vectoring us for altitude loss and put us in a perfect position for landing XXR. [It was] VMC at the airport; [our] landing [was] normal. Cleared runway and taxied to gate followed by emergency vehicles. Deplaned passengers via jetway. [We] had to completely power down aircraft to stop sparking. I still have no idea how much time passed between getting first call and landing. Probably the usual 10-15 minutes; in my mind, it feels like a blur of focused, coordinated activity. Aircraft was under maximum landing weight. Captain and I were debriefed and answered a series of questions. I thought the questions were well formulated and the answers offered good options. However, I feel they were asked too soon after the stress event: I answered truthfully and the way I felt at that time but I still had a fairly large amount of adrenaline in my system. Had I been asked the same questions 2 hours later, I think some of my answers would have been different. Both Captain and I flew the continuation of our flight. I realized after takeoff that I was in my 'coming down from the adrenaline rush' process; I felt shaky and unfocused during the flight. In hindsight, I feel that I should not have been flying that leg AT THAT TIME.		A320 flight crew is informed of electrical sparks beneath passenger seats in the cabin. Crew diverts to the nearest suitable airport while the Captain preforms the QRH procedure for smoke and fumes and flight attendants use fire extinguishers on the sparks. Flight lands safely and passengers are deplaned at the gate. All power is removed from the aircraft before the electrical sparking stops. The crew accepts assignment to continue to destination in another aircraft.

After performing the checklist, I elected to return to the departure airport because I was not sure of the nature of the damage and we would not have enough fuel for the trip to our domestic destination.  We declared an emergency and informed Departure that we will be returning to the departure airport and making an overweight landing and request Airport Rescue and Fire Fighters to stand by and will be dumping fuel.  We dumped fuel to facilitate a 30 flap landing in order to minimize ref speed.  We accomplished the overweight landing checklist, emergency landing checklist and briefed the flight attendants (TEST brief).  We returned to ZZZZ, stopped on the runway and had brakes and tires inspected by Airport Rescue and Fire Fighters. we then returned to the parking area.		After parking at a remote parking spot, the passengers were deplaned and bussed to the terminal. The flight crew debriefed ZZZZ maintenance, operations and returned to the hotel.		A B777's right IDG failed after takeoff so the Captain declared an emergency and returned to the departure airport.

She agreed there was a trace of smoke smell. She further indicated they were requesting one of our deadheading pilots to help investigate and they would call me with additional information. First Officer located the Smoke/Fire/Fumes checklist and both pilots noted multiple suitable airports near the route of flight. Weather was not a factor (clear, VFR, daytime). Captain sent an advisory note to Dispatch.Passengers were asked to move out of the affected area and the deadheading pilot checked the area in question thoroughly. Passenger seated across from the area told the pilot checking that he had also smelled smoke, and that the audio system had static then the video screen failed. Dispatch had set up a communication link and we discussed the need to consider a diversion. Maintenance Control needed the specific location of problem and asked if the audio or video was affected. They advised we have had multiple failures of the entertainment system. From the cabin reports we knew that some or all of the video screens had failed. Maintenance did not see a need to pull system breakers but, as a precaution, the suspect entertainment system was to remain off for the duration of the flight.The deadheading pilot found no popped circuit breakers. All electric systems appeared normal and lightly loaded. On arrival Maintenance met the aircraft and the fault was quickly discovered in the suspect location and it appears the fault was completely contained in the entertainment unit.		FA called cockpit and reported smelling smoke near row 22. Captain asked for deadheading crewmember to investigate. DH crew reported PES [passenger entertainment system] not working and residual electrical smell near row 22. Directed lead FA to shut down PES after which smoke smell went away. Captain contacted DISP and SAM. SAM indicated similar problem with 4 other aircraft in last week isolated to PES control box under seat. All concurred that threat was over and continue flight to destination. Flight landed uneventfully. Maintenance had box pulled within 20 minutes after landing.		An A320 flight crew isolated the source of a burning, smoky odor to the Passenger Entertainment System. The system was turned off and the flight completed.

Departed with TRWs [in] all quadrants except takeoff departure path. Requested flight attendants to remain seated until I call them because of weather. After sterile chime, climbing through 11,000 FT, [with] seatbelt sign on, #1 Flight Attendant called flightdeck [and] asked that I make PA for passengers to remain seated. [He/she] said one first class passenger came to them several times angrily requesting service. First Officer [was] flying [and] weaving around weather with assistance from ATC and RADAR. Level at 17,000 FT [with] autopilot on in heading select mode. We planned for FL240 and ATC said FL220 would be our final [altitude]. ATC cleared us to climb from 17,000 FT to FL220. I set FL220 in altitude MCP window and received acknowledgment from the First Officer for FL220. Still dealing with passenger issue in first class, monitoring flight progress, listening to ATC in back ground, while talking to #1 Flight Attendant. First Officer was doing a good job deviating around weather. I did not notice First Officer grab the altitude selector knob instead of heading select knob to try to turn the aircraft further right around weather. He was looking outside as we were between CB cells. He realized the aircraft was not turning and he looked at MCP and saw 241 in altitude window. Realizing what he had done he reset 240 instead of 220 back in altitude window. He had FL240 on the brain because we were filed for FL240. We were both task-saturated at this point dealing with all issues [stated above]. I rejoined First Officer after passenger issue and normal checklist completion and we were approaching FL220. I noticed we didn't get our 900 FT prior illumination on our altimeters and looked at altitude window and saw 24,000 FT displayed. I asked the First Officer if we had been given FL240; he didn't answer. As we climbed through FL220 at approximately 500 FPM, I said to level at 220! The First Officer turned off autopilot and descended from 22,250 FT back to FL220. Turned autopilot back on and we remained at FL220. I asked him why 24,000 FT was in the altitude window. We were so busy we had to put that behind us and complete our mission of flying the aircraft to a safe landing. We broke out of weather about 150 miles from our destination and landed the aircraft uneventfully. Later that day we sat down and discussed the altitude issue again, confirming his inadvertent setting of altitude instead of heading. This brings to mind, why are these knobs the same shape? And what happened to the flight engineer?				While the Captain coordinated with a Flight Attendant about an unruly passenger, the distracted First Officer turned the B737-800's altitude set window to FL240 instead of selecting heading 240 to deviate around weather, overshooting the assigned FL220 by 250 FT.

Thirty minutes later the Lead Flight Attendant notified us that an armrest had been smoking and the smoke stopped when the Passenger Entertainment System was shut off. The First Officer and I briefly discussed the situation and decided to divert. Overweight landing and we flew above 250 KTS below 10,000 MSL. No further smoke was observed.				An A320 diverted under emergency conditions to a nearby airport when the passenger entertainment system at one passenger seat was smoking. The smoke ceased when power to the Passenger Entertainment System was shut off.

Auto Thrust did not engage. I manually flew the aircraft to the initial level off altitude of approximately 3000 ft. The captain attempted unsuccessfully to engage autopilot two then one, and reengage the auto thrust system. We determined that even with these systems INOP we could continue the flight to destination provided we stayed below RVSM airspace. We leveled off at 28000 feet and notified Dispatch. They sent new projected fuel burn numbers confirming we had enough fuel for the trip. We then navigated using manually tuned NAV radios, airways and radar vectors. Enroute we discovered that we were unable to access any portion of either FMCG. The captain wrote the discrepancy up and alerted Maintenance. We completed the flight with an uneventful landing.[Prior to the flight] While awaiting transportation to the hotel at the airport, scheduling called indicating that there was an airplane on mechanical that we would be taking instead of our originally scheduled flight and plane. The reason given was that the original crew was running into a crew duty day issue and would operate our flight while we would wait for the broken airplane to get fixed. Scheduling asked me to notify the Captain, stay at the hotel and call back for an update. About thirty minutes later scheduling called indicating that maintenance said the airplane was ready and to come to the airport. Arriving at the airport, passengers were applauding our arrival and the gate agents started making preparation for passenger boarding. I briefly looked at the log book which indicated that the NAV data base was out of date, and on MEL. I then completed my walk around. Upon my return to the cockpit I observed that the MCDU was displaying a message to the effect that there was an incomplete NAV data upload and that the FMGC was in separate operations. I was unable to align the INS and called maintenance. Passenger boarding was almost complete. The maintenance tech aligned the INS using the overhead panel. I queried the tech as to what if any other malfunctions would be impacting our flight and specifically would the autopilot and autothrust work. He indicated that they should work. The Captain and I reread the MEL, discussed manually tuning NAV aids, got out the enroute charts and high lighted the route and discussed the flight. When we took the runway for take off, I felt that we were in compliance with the MEL and would not have any difficulty in completing the flight. At no time had anyone, scheduling, maintenance or station supervisor (who came down to check on us) indicate that the previous crew had refused the aircraft. Upon reflection of the events, I believe that the MEL was misapplied. We were working way too hard to safely accomplish what should have been a simple flight. It now appears that not only was the data base was out of date but that there was no NAV data base at all and that we had we had a more serious problem. While I had received some clues that there was something else wrong, (nav data upload incomplete, unable to align INS normally, FMGC separate operations, autopilot and auto thrust 'should work') at that time I was unable to determine what the bigger problem might be until after level off at cruise altitude. In my eleven plus years with this company, I have never encountered a situation where maintenance or operations has tried to hide the actual status of the aircraft from me. My honeymoon now appears to be over. On a better day I may have had the clarity of thought to ask the right questions and get a truer picture of what was wrong with the airplane before taking off. [Suggest Company] not shop for another crew to take a broken airplane. Don't hide actual aircraft status from the crews. As an aircrew member maintain a healthy skepticism of operations and maintenance actions.				A320 First Officer reported events leading up to being assigned an aircraft with one FMGC on MEL.  On takeoff autothrust and autopilot cannot be engaged.  The flight was continued to destination using manually tuned NAV radios and Radar vectors.

Subsequently cleared Direct to SEGUL intersection.  I commenced left turn while clearing visually left for traffic.  First Officer went heads-down to enter the direct routing into the FMGC via the MCDU.  As he initiated the direct, I scanned my ND display to get an approximation of my roll out heading.  In the new FMGC software in the Airbus, the new fix is not displayed in the upper right corner until after the command is executed. As the First Officer executed the direct command, and I continued my left turn to align my heading with the ND displayed track, I glanced in the upper left corner to see that the FMGC was actually giving us guidance directly to the MCKEY intersection.  I announced our error and immediately started a turn back to the right to correct our course back to SEGUL, as the First Officer reentered a new direct routing command to SEGUL in the MCDU.  It was about that time that the Controller queried our heading and we verified that we were cleared to SEGUL.  In our post-error discussion, the First Officer said that he thought the execution error happened as he inserted the direct routing as the MCDU was 'auto-sequencing' and rearranging pseudo waypoints, etc. The Controller made no further comments over the frequency regarding our brief overshoot turn beyond the direct SEGUL routing.  The overshoot was approximately 30 degrees beyond the heading we should have initially rolled out on for the direct routing to SEGUL.  We were on the erred heading 15 seconds or less. We corrected our error promptly. To our knowledge, there were no other aircraft in our immediate vicinity according to information displayed by TCAS, and no loss of separation occurred. However, this minor deviation did uncover and highlight for me, the potential with the new Airbus FMGC software, to be led toward a navigation waypoint before you can actually verify it on the ND, as is built into Airbus pilots' previous habit patterns.				An A320 was taken off a SID but when re-cleared to a fix on that SID, the FMGC transitioned to a SID point downstream just as the DIRECT button was pushed causing a track deviation. The crew did not expect the FMGC transition which was different behavior after installation of new FMGC software.

Approximately 8 miles west of the airport descending to 6,000 FT, the autopilot kicked itself off. As the flying pilot, I took control of the aircraft and began to manually fly. We then realized that the failure was due to the ELAC ECAM. The First Officer read the messages off the ECAM. We were in 'Alternate Law' without an autopilot  We had an ELAC fault and an ELAC pitch trim failure in BOTH ELAC's. Note: The ECAM did not give us the 'Blue to do items' it just gave us the problem, VRef + 10, Direct Law with gear down info. The First Officer requested an extended downwind and declared an emergency. The irregular procedure in the flight manual was then referenced and read by the First Officer. When the ELAC switches were cycled we regained the functionality of both ELAC's. We then finished up the action items per the manual and took a turn back toward the airport. Landing and taxi in was uneventful.		During arrival just prior to turning downwind, auto pilot pilot kicked off accompanied by slight roll to the left. Captain hand flew. Numerous ECAM's popped up: alternate law, ELAC faults 1 and 2, ELAC pitch faults 1 and 2. We declared emergency. I ran the ECAM and numerous checklists while Captain flew and talked with ATC. ELAC's were recovered just prior to the Outer Marker. Captain landed uneventfully.		A320 flight crew experiences a dual ELAC failure during descent which is annunciated by the ECAM but without any ECAM actions. Flight Manual procedures indicated a reset of the ELAC's, which was successful, and a normal landing ensued.

The static was present whether the radar was on or off. The static was loud enough to drown out almost all ATC communications. Dispatch was notified and an early maintenance alert was made. The airplane was grounded for repairs on arrival. I understand that some static wicks and flap track canoe fairing bonding straps were replaced. The VHF antenna were also checked. I was assigned to reposition the aircraft empty back to a maintenance base later in the day. On the reposition flight we had the same static issue as before while flying in cloud avoiding thunderstorms with radar, except that the static happened only when a radio transition was made either by ATC or another aircraft, where before the static was continuous when flying in clouds. As before, radar on or off made no difference. On both days ATC reported that our radio transmissions were OK. Another maintenance early alert was made for this static issue. The static also appeared to be kicking the ACARS in and out of standby. An additional early alert maintenance write-up was made for the ACARS as well. This is not the first time I have encountered this type of static problem on the Airbus A320. It is very disconcerting situation as it will usually only make itself apparent during thunderstorm season when we encounter clouds with higher static electricity. Going around thunderstorms at night in the clouds is not the time to find out that you can't communicate with ATC due to radio static. I would like to know how often the static wicks and binding straps are checked by maintenance. The pilots do a visual check that they are in position on the walk around but I understand that there are additional checks for proper grounding and connections that maintenance performs?

An A320 had VHF radio static so loud it blocked ATC communications when the aircraft was flying in clouds and avoiding thunderstorms.

Aircraft shuddered and flames at exhaust visible. Engine rolled back to sub-idle. No fire or high EGT. Engine secured per QRH. Emergency declared and fire trucks requested. Single engine approach flown by Captain. ATC gave 20-mile final to the runway and then put an Airbus in front of us so we had wake turbulence from 1,500 FT AGL to the ground. Complete handful. Offset to right to stay out of it to 200 FT AGL. Rollout uneventful. Fire trucks inspected engine and taxied to gate. Dispatch contacted for emergency and divert plan with no response.		About 40 miles from the Top of Descent, aircraft began to shudder/vibrate, yawed slightly and lost airspeed. Captain and I scanned quickly and determined #2 engine had rolled back to about 50% N1. There were no indications of a fire or overheat at the time. I flew the aircraft and the Captain got out the checklist and asked ATC for a lower altitude. I started a shallow descent without the autopilot (since it kicked off) and attempted to trim out rudder forces to get the A/P back on. Prior to running the checklist, we got two calls from the flight attendants. One was, 'What was that?' and the other was to let us know the C Flight Attendant had noticed flames and sparks out the right side of the aircraft. The Captain acknowledged and told them to stand by for further information. We ran the checklist and decided to shut the engine down. I continued the descent and the Captain pulled up the Engine Out page in the FMC. The descent and approach were uneventful until final where we discovered Approach Control had put an Airbus 321 in front of us less than 5 miles. After configuring for the single engine landing, we encountered moderate wake turbulence and the Captain flew a slightly offset final until about 300 ft. The landing was uneventful and we taxied clear of the runway to get checked out by emergency vehicles. It was determined by the Fire Chief there was no evidence of fire or severe damage to the aircraft so we continued our taxi back to our gate.		A B737-700 Captain reported engine failure in cruise at FL340. The engine was secured and a single engine approach flown, which was complicated by wake from preceding aircraft.

One change was in very close range which included going direct to XXXXX. I (PM) reached for the Low Enroute Chart, which we already had out and available while the Captain (PF), attempted to enter the new clearance on the route page. Though the fixes were all on the airway, the box would not accept the change, further intensifying the urgency we felt to comply with the clearance and adding to task saturation. While this was occurring, we were given a climb to 110. The Captain set the altitude (110) but I don't remember him leaving his finger there till I confirmed or whether I did confirm it. The Captain was still trying to fix the FMC route and I had told ATC that the FMC wouldn't take the route. He finally gave us XXXXX and then said descend and maintain 100 (we were at 10,600 FT) and contact Center. Autopilot was on from about 2,000 FT AGL. After changing frequencies, it seemed an odd clearance (though it was given in a routine manner) and we questioned whether we had erred or if the Controller had changed his mind, hence this report. We were given many reroutes in a very short amount of time, and I think in climbout at 2,000 FT is no place ATC should give full route clearances. Furthermore, there is no logical reason to give pilots going 250 knots last minute changes requiring using charts to enter routes. A simple 'cleared direct XXXXX on course' would have sufficed. Also, the FMC programming should be changed to accept the clearance 'XXXXX' which in our tail number it would not.		ATC needs to understand the task loading going on during initial climbout and not add too much to it. My mistake was not shedding the navigation task to my First Officer. Since the FMC would not take the clearance, we had to get the high charts out and find a jet route in the jam packed Northeast corridor. We were so busy I don't remember what altitude we were cleared to. So I don't actually know if we busted an altitude or not.		A flight crew reported that leaving 2,000 FT in the climb, ATC issued an amended full route clearance, but the crew could not get the FMC to accept it. The Captain became task saturated and failed to level at 10,000 FT while the First Officer was getting airways charts out.

We ran the checklist and the bleed would not reset.  At the beginning of the descent, approximately FL390, the left bleed trip off light illuminated.  We donned the O2 masks and ran the Emergency Descent checklist as the pressurization was uncontrollable.  Upon level off at 10,000 feet, the checklist was completed.  The cabin altitude reached approximately FL220.  Paramedics were called due to a Customer complaining of ear problems.  Communication between the Captain and me was difficult due the ambient noise and difficulty communicating through the O2 mask.  The Flight Attendants were difficult to understand as well due to the noise.  Communication with the Flight Attendants was also difficult through the mask microphone.  They were not able to understand the Captain very well.		Shortly after reaching cruise altitude of FL400, the right bleed trip light illuminated, ran the Bleed Trip Off checklist. The bleed would not reset. Finished remaining checklist items and continued to destination. Shortly after TOD, the left bleed trip off light illuminated.  Oxygen masks were dawned immediately after the second bleed light illuminated and did the cabin altitude warning horn memory items, even though we had no warning horn at the time. Shortly after, the cabin altitude did reach approximately 22,000 FT. An emergency descent was initiated, emergency was declared with ATC; the Cabin Warning Horn checklist was run followed by the Emergency Descent checklist. Communication between me and my First Officer were difficult due to ambient wind noise and speech being garbled by the masks themselves. Flight Attendants also had difficulty understanding instructions when using the masks.The emergency descent was continued to 10,000 FT and O2 masks were removed after the cabin altitude was below 10,000 FT. 290 KTS was maintained until approximately 8000 FT and 35 miles from landing. Descent checklist and Before Landing checklist were accomplished followed by a normal landing.		B737-700 flight crew experienced a right bleed trip at FL400 which could not be reset. Just after beginning descent for landing the left bleed trips causing the cabin altitude to reach 22000 feet during the descent.  A normal landing ensues at destination with one passenger being treated by paramedics for ear problems.

The ECAM procedure was to turn off the hot air valve to isolate the duct overheat in the system. The switch had no effect on the hot air valve, leaving the system with no protection from the overheat. Maintenance was contacted for further information and input. We talked with Dispatch and coordinated a return to the departure airport. Upon leveling off and descending, the valve finally closed on its own. With the overheat isolated, we decided to hold and burn off fuel to the maximum landing weight. During our holding, the hot air valve started opening and closing. With the system uncontrollable and unstable, we decided to descend into the airport. The decision was made to land overweight due to the unknown, uncontrollable, and overheated system. The risk of landing overweight was minimal when compared to the risk of an overheated system in this state. An emergency was declared, and the landing was completed without incident.				An A320 ECAM alerted HOT AIR VALVE but the ECAM procedure did not close the HOT AIR VALVE so the crew declared an emergency and returned to the departure airport for an overweight landing.

There were about 3-4 points to delete. While I was deleting the points the MCDU froze up and would not allow any input. Seconds later we lost all data in the MCDU, lost both map displays, lost ILS signal. We still showed 1FD2 on the PFD so I guess the FMGC's were working. We both tried to do a lateral revision from a fix to get the 'New Destination' prompt but the box would not accept this. We figured out how to manually enter the ILS frequency with the standby nav technique (this is something we never do and stumbled to remember how to do it). This all happened within minutes of landing at a very inconvenient time. We broke out of the clouds and could make a visual approach thankfully. The box was trying to reinitialize itself but we landed before it fixed itself. We wanted to make a record of this incase there was a trend with the new box. Once again, it all happened when we were sequencing the box for final intercept.		We were on a heading for vectors to Runway 16C at SEA. First Officer was sequencing the box and both NDs showed map unavailable and both FMGCs went blank. We put SEA back into the FMGC when it booted back up.	The Reporter stated that this air carrier installed new FMGC's some time ago and has had several software updates each with unique anomalies. The QRH has procedures to deal with this specific type of fault but since the aircraft were on approach and became VMC shortly after the MCDU froze it was not necessary to complete the procedure.	Both A320 new series FMGCs blanked and both ND's showed MAP UNAVAILABLE as the First Officer was sequencing waypoints on final approach to SEA. The ILS was manually turned to complete the approach.

My First Officer and I reviewed and noted the NOTAMs for the Shead 7 departure. NOTAM No 1/242: Shead 7 departure; cross MDDOG at 9000'; ATC/at or above 9000';. Cross TARRK at 11000'; ATC/at or above 11000';. Our PDC cleared us to FL190 with SID restrictions. When I checked in with LAS departure, I heard the controller assigning unrestricted climb to previous traffic. Climbing through 5000';, I asked the Departure Controller about the NOTAM altitudes and which set applied to us regarding ATC vs. at or above altitudes. He replied with yes, comply with the NOTAM at or above altitudes and then stated climb unrestricted through 11000';. I read that back and understood that we were to climb unrestricted to 11000'; and then continue to climb to FL190 while complying with the rest of the restrictions. My First Officer had the same understanding and he was the pilot flying. Controller never said 'climb and maintain 11000''. ATC gave us a traffic alert at 12000' and instructed us to maintain 12000'. ATC notified us of a B737. We had said traffic in sight. There was not any TCAS conflict. We were given a phone number and advised by the controller to call it upon landing, for a possible deviation. I contacted the TRACON supervisor upon arrival. After hearing my explanation, he agreed to investigate further as well as listen to the tapes. He called me back to inform me that he concurred with our explanation. He acknowledged that the controller did not use standard phraseology. He also said that altitude busts unfortunately happen quite often in Las Vegas due to the complex altitude restrictions.  I agree with that assessment. I think the communication issues coupled with multiple complex crossing restrictions are causing deviations and confusion. Standard, clear, and timely communication between the controller and pilot is crucial.In this case, my question about the NOTAM to the controller aggravated the problem. Next time, I will try to clarify the questionable NOTAMs on the ground to avoid confusion. I will also query the controllers about incomplete and suspect clearances.				Air Carrier departure from LAS described confusion regarding the Shead 7 SID, the crossing altitudes ATC vs. conventional, the NOTAM instructions and ATC's phraseology.

We contacted the other aircraft and asked him to offset to the right so that we could return to centerline (we were offset 2 NM right) and get out of the wake turbulence (winds were a quartering left tailwind and we were trying to get upwind of him). We could not descend as there was another aircraft 1,000 FT below us in close proximity. I suggested a left offset and after some discussion the other First Officer agreed. We then offset 2 NM left of centerline (that put us out of the turbulence) until we passed the higher flight and returned to centerline. We then offset 2 NM right of course and continued to our destination. Right offset is standard and we should have coordinated with Gander for a left 2 NM offset.				An A330 First Officer reported encountering wake turbulence in cruise from another aircraft on the same NAT track routing.

Looking down at the E/WD, I saw the ECAM 'Eng 2 Stall' and saw engine indications that back this up. I immediately retarded the power to idle on engine 2 and asked for the QRH. Retarding the power to idle stopped the stall and the ECAM disappeared. We declared an emergency and began the driftdown. ATC advised that ZZZ (about 80 NM southeast) was available and the weather was good. I continued to fly and took over communications with ATC. The Captain communicated with Dispatch, the flight attendants, and the passengers. We were vectored for a visual approach to ZZZ. We discussed leaving the #2 engine running at idle and did so, discussed overweight landing (we were almost at maximum landing weight - maybe 500 LBS over), etc. and completed the necessary checklists. I briefed single engine approach and go-around procedures. I continued to fly and made an uneventful landing with #2 at idle and #1 operating normally. The touchdown was smooth and I avoided braking until below 80 KTS to prevent any brake issues. The emergency equipment visually inspected our brakes and engine 2 and we taxied to the gate normally. I believe we handled this emergency by the book and with great CRM and airmanship. No human factors adversely affected this event.				A320 flight crew experiences an engine stall at FL350 and retards the thrust lever to idle. An emergency is declared and the flight diverts to the nearest suitable airport with right engine at idle.

But then between two arrival intersections, the airport turned around and I re-briefed for Runway 1L. The First Officer changed the runway and the PERF APPR Page in the MCDU. Shortly after, we turned downwind and were given a heading by Approach Control. I then asked the First Officer to extend the runway center line back the final approach fix. He did this by selecting NO STAR while cleaning up the approach. While descending out of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 FT we experienced what I believe was a dual FMGC failure. Both PFDs froze. Both ND's went blank. Both MCDU's froze and no data could be entered. While still descending I attempted to switch over to the ILS via raw date by transferring to the NAV ILS mode on the EFIS Control Panel and by engaging the NAV ILS buttons on the RMP Standby NAV. I was successful in entering the ILS frequency, but was not able to enter the course. The ND displayed the compass rose, but no guidance needle came to view. We told ATC we were experiencing navigations problems and asked them for a vector/heading toward the end of the runway. There was a cloud layer at with ragged bases between 1,500 and 1,000 FT, so using ATC headings and the DME from the PROG. Page, I started a 700 FT per minute descent from where I estimated the final approach fix to be and broke out below the clouds approximately 3 miles from the end of the runway. We landed on Runway 1L and taxied to the gate. I have no idea why we had this failure. Maintenance preformed a full systems check and found no failures.				An A320 Captain reported that as the First Officer was reprogramming the FMGC following a runway change he selected NO STAR and both FMGC's and PFD's froze and the ND's blanked.

Situational conditions made this a prudent decision in this case. During climb out, ECAM, Hyd Y Rsvr Lo Air PR, displayed. All ECAM procedures and Flight Manual actions were completed. The ECAM contained 'conditional' item that dealt with fluctuations in pressure of the affected system. Initially, this condition was not met but after a few minutes, pressure fluctuations did occur and the conditional item on the ECAM was accomplished.We then decided to return to the departure airport.

Our limits are 5.0 and the engine lower display ECAM was flashing at 6.0.  Over the next five minutes the vibration number increased to a high of 8.3 and noticable vibration was felt throughout the airplane and controls.  No other adverse indications from any other engine indications.  We referred to the Flight Manual and contacted maintenance through Dispatch.  As the Captain tried to communicate problem to Maintenance we reduced the bad engine power to idle.  I coordinated a slow descent with ATC since we could not hold altitude with one engine at idle.  The N1 vibration at idle initially indicated 3.5 which was below the 5.0 limit.  We decided it best to keep the engine at idle.  We did try one increase and the vibration increased again.  We did not try again.  After discussions with Dispatch and Maintenance we made the decision to divert to the closest suitable airport.  We made an uneventful descent and landing using the good engine and keeping the vibrating one in idle.  I did note the N1 Vibration was almost zero once we were with approach and at about 10,000 feet.  After landing we shut the engine down as soon as we cleared the runway.   Our checklist in the Flight Manual provided very little guidance.  It did direct us to land at the nearest suitable airport and that's the only statement that really provided any useful guidance in this situation.  It should be also noted that our maintenance did not have access to engine data while we were airborne as is provided by other modern aircraft.  This resulted in us having to spend time to accurately report the condition of the engine to Maintenance.  I think ZZZ logistically would have been a better divert airfield but would not have met our requirement to land at the nearest suitable airfield.		At FL360, in and out of clouds, SAT -54, lower EWD [Engine Warning Display] rolled to ENGINES. The right engine indicated N1 VIB (vibrations) of over 5.0, peaking at 8.3. [We] descended to FL280 with the thrust lever retarded, unable to bring VIB below 5.0. Descended to FL200 with the thrust level at idle, we were able to bring VIB to below 5.0. We were in contact with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. With thrust lever at idle and per the Irregular checklist we decided to divert.		An A320 flight crew diverted to the nearest suitable airport when the vibration level of the right engine suddenly increased beyond limits.

All this plus the interruption that occurred when flight attendants passed meals forward caused the loss of concentration and subsequent imbalance.				A B737-800 flight crew encountered a fuel imbalance warning that they were unable to correct due to confusion over the procedure logic regarding the 800 vice other NG models. Distractions with flight attendants delivering flight crew meals contributed to the failure to monitor the fuel issue.

ATC reported no traffic around our location. Then we got an RA, First Officer disconnected autopilot, climbed to get descent rate out of the 'red' zone per procedure. We then got 'clear of conflict' and proceeded on to land. All three of us thought that this RA was an erroneous alert, given the earlier event in cruise and the jumping around of the target on the TA and RA event.

Then we got a brakes BSCU CH1 FAULT ECAM. We accomplished the ECAM and continued the descent. Since a failure of only one channel of the BSCU does not affect the braking system at all I did not see a need to try a system reset. In fact, the Airbus is routinely dispatched with one channel of the BSCU inoperative. On initial contact with Approach we were given the right runway and I deselected the auto-brakes since I was going to have a longer roll to desired high speed. On landing, full reverse was applied and I noticed out of the peripheral vision that the wheel page was displayed and something was written in amber. I applied brakes pressure and the aircraft responded but in an unusual manner. We exited the runway and I reapplied the brakes, but needed much more than normal pedal depression to get any braking. I then looked closer at the wheel page and noticed a green 'ALT BRAKES' and amber 'AUTO BRKS' indication and saw that the brake pressure indications on the accumulator gauge were in fact reacting to my brake inputs, which indicated a failure of the entire normal brake system. I slowed the aircraft and using the 'A' SKID/NWS switch, reset the system and normal braking returned. My fundamental question is, how did the failure of just one BSCU channel cause the system to revert to alternate brakes? Why did we get no other ECAMs or warnings that we had lost normal braking? If this had occurred on a short runway with slippery conditions the outcome could have been different.				An A320 Captain experienced a BSCU CH1 fault when autobrakes are armed during approach. During landing it was discovered that only alternate brakes were available. The A SKID/NWS switch was used to reset the system.

We also noticed a significant asymmetric condition as well on the flap indicator gauge. We quickly checked the overhead panel and saw that the LE Devices were all in the correct position for flaps 1. We were now at 3,000 feet getting ready to turn final for the visual and we had 6,200 LBS of fuel on board. Before turning final I told the First Officer, who was the pilot flying, 'We're unable to land here.' I immediately declared an emergency and requested a turn toward [a larger airport].I pulled out the QRH and started to follow the procedures for LE Transit Light. The flaps were completely frozen somewhere between 0 and 1 degrees and they were split. I asked my First Officer if she felt any adverse roll or unusual flight handling and she said, 'No.' She said it felt normal. I followed the QRH procedures long enough to ascertain that the flaps were not going to move at all. We did not need to burn any more fuel, and the weather was clear with a 7 KT wind out of the south. We maintained above minimum maneuvering speed until established on final and flew 'angle of attack' (3 o'clock position) on the AOA indicator to 19L - 11,500 FT of runway. We touched down at 190 KTS within the first 1,000 FT and used then entire length of the runway to decelerate. We were inspected by the ARFF crew and told that our brake temperatures were 212 degrees and 165 degrees for the left and right brakes. I did not set the brakes initially as I know they were just beginning to heat up.After the ARFF inspected our aircraft, they gave us the appropriate hand signals that all was well/clear and with a verbal confirmation as well and we began to taxi toward our gate. I did not feel comfortable taxiing into a congested terminal area with the brakes heating up, so I elected to go to a remote area and wait. I requested ARFF to come back out and to re-inspect me and to again check my brakes for high temperatures. The ARFF quickly arrived and informed me that the two fuse plugs on the left main had blown.		While being vectored downwind for the visual and I called for flaps 1. Asked to slow further to 180 KTS by ATC, I called for flaps 5. We then got an LE flaps disagreement light and the flap indicator was split between flaps 0 and 1. We asked for a vector off the approach for a flap problem. We read the QRH for the LE disagreement light. We tried the different items to no avail. The flaps would not move down, nor, would they come back up. With the asymmetry between 0 and 1 (needles split on flap indicator), we decided to declare an emergency and went to [a nearby airport] to land at a long runway requesting ARFF meet us. Agreeing with the split flap condition, using alternate flaps could magnify the problem of asymmetry (no asymmetrical protection with alternate flaps). After landing 190 KTS in touchdown zone and slowing the aircraft down using available length, we pulled off and had ARFF meet us to check out the aircraft (brakes, tires). No abnormalities noted besides maybe hot brakes.We called Maintenance for their advice. They said to not allow anyone near the wheel well for at least one hour. We then taxied to the other end of the runway and had ARFF to recheck us. They chocked the nose wheels. (Knowing the heat would still be building). The fuse plugs on the left main had blown a tire from the brake heat. We noticed also that the PSEU (Proximity Switch Electronic Unit) light lit on the ground. We completed the parking checklist and disembarked by people mover for Maintenance to take care of the aircraft.		B737-800 flight crew experiences a leading edge flap asymmetry during approach when the flaps are selected to 1. Flight declares an emergency and diverts to a nearby airport with a longer runway. Flight lands with LE flaps at 1 and TE flaps up at 190 KTS, resulting in fuse plugs deflating two main tires some time after landing.

The weather was clear and the winds were 5-7 KTS out of the west.  We conducted a visual approach but once we touched down, the nose of the aircraft started to drift left of the centerline.  I immediately started to apply right rudder but to no avail.  It felt like the rudder was frozen.  I then started to apply a great deal of pressure to the right rudder (I would estimate 100-200 LBS of pressure).  The rudder then started to move a little bit and I was able to straighten the nose out and parallel the center line.  I asked the First Officer if he was on the rudder and he said no.  Then the rudder started to fluctuate left and right and the nose started to respond by moving left and right.  At this time I asked the First Officer to come on the rudders with me and help me keep them centered.  He did and we were able to keep the aircraft going down the runway straight until I got the aircraft slow enough to introduce the tiller.  When we cleared the runway, we could move the rudder pedals full deflection in either direction with no resistance or feel at all.  The rudder pedals felt as if they were not connected to anything.  However, when we moved the rudder pedals from left to right they did command the nose wheel steering to steer left or right. I then used the nose wheel steering disconnect button on the tiller and accomplished a flight control rudder check.  When I pushed the rudder pedals full left and then full right, the rudder indication on the flight control display page did not move.  The rudder on the flight control display page stayed in the center position.  We taxied to the gate without incident and wrote the discrepancy up.  We then waited for a maintenance technician and we briefed him.	Reporter states that maintenance found that a nut had come off a bolt in the tail of the aircraft and caused the problems reported. After clearing the runway the rudder pedals moved freely without resistance which confused the issue even more.			A320 Captain experiences 'frozen' rudder pedals upon landing and subsequent difficulty maintaining directional control.  With help from the First Officer control is maintained and the Captain is able to steer using the tiller.  Once clear of the runway a flight control check is accomplished and the rudder shows no movement for a full scale rudder pedal deflection.

ILS 22 was also briefed and loaded in the secondary route. New York Approach said to expect a visual approach to Runway 22. On base leg with field at in sight at 2,000 FT we were cleared for a visual approach to 22. At this time I called for the secondary approach to be activated. Outer Marker COHOP on LDA-A is 1,600 FT, Outer Marker GREKO on ILS 22 is 1,900 FT. In the transition to the visual (backed up by the ILS 22) I thought I needed to cross GREKO at 1,600 FT, placing the aircraft high on profile. I selected -1,800 FT/minutes Vertical Speed to intercept glide slope from above. As the Captain cross-checked he realized the aircraft was low on profile. At that time (approximately 1,600 FT) I disconnected the auto pilot, arrested the descent, and maintained level flight until re-intercepting the glide slope (at approximately 1,400 FT), and landed normally. Approach Control and LGA Tower informed us they received a low altitude alert. Spend more time flying the aircraft and less time managing the automation. Had I tracked the LDA-A course and flown a Visual Approach it would have eliminated a high work load in a time compressed situation.		I (pilot not flying) went to the MCDU and activated the secondary route. I then received a message that there was an ILS/RWY mismatch. This was due to the fact that, per the airport briefing page, we were to hard tune the LDA frequency in the RAD/NAV page for the LDA-A approach. I selected the RAD/NAV page in the MCDU and deleted the LDA IDENT/FREQ and then the ILS information automatically displayed.I [then] noticed that we were at approximately 1,600 MSL and descending. I alerted the First Officer that he was low and then noticed that the speed was approaching flap overspeed. I advised 'watch your speed, you're fast'. At this point the First Officer disconnected the autopilot, leveled and slowed the aircraft, and we intercepted the glide slope from below.I didn't remember if approach had handed us over to the Tower so I queried approach if he wanted us to to go the Tower? His reply, after a short moment, was to ask if we were still with him. He said he had a low altitude alert and to contact the Tower. After I switched to Tower frequency, the Controller said that he'd been trying to contact us and that he had had a low altitude alert and that we had been too low.		An A320 flight crew, caught up in autoflight manipulation and company mandated airport procedural requirements, descended below the glide slope towards terrain triggering low altitude alerts from both Approach Control and the Tower.

An A320 flight crew reported a rejected takeoff due to a hot brakes ECAM. All of the brake temperatures were bellow 300 degrees but this was a repeat anomaly so the crew refused the aircraft until it was properly repaired.

I was the pilot flying and called the birds as did the Captain. I pitched the nose up above the normal climb out attitude to try to avoid the flock but still hit at least one bird avoiding the bulk of the flock. We instantly noticed a vibration coming from the engine(s) and the Tower called us within a few seconds to tell us they didn't think our engines were sounding normal as we climbed away from the runway. We both looked at the engine instruments and saw nothing unusual except the engine vibe gauges slowly climbing. We requested a turn to the west up the valley and continued our climb to 5,000 FT to assess the problem. Once level and with the power back, the noise went away but we decided to head to a nearby airport for a precautionary landing, not wanting to use high thrust settings anymore. We declared an emergency as a precaution and briefed the flight attendants and passengers and diverted for a normal landing. Once at the gate, we visually inspected the engines and found three to four fan blades on the #1 engine bent near the outer edges.				A B737-700 declared an emergency and diverted to another airport after suffering multiple bird strikes and subsequent engine vibrations shortly after takeoff.

The First Officer cycled the switch but the bleed stayed full open. We elected, as the safest course of action, to continue and land at 30 flaps as we were well below 1,000 FT AFL. Changing flaps and approach speed was too dangerous, as was a possible mountainous terrain go-around at the minimum divert fuel for our alternate. After landing, the bleed valve was, in fact, confirmed full open.Note: if there was a subsequent high altitude takeoff and the crew failed (easily) to notice the valve open for a bleeds off required takeoff, a dangerous lack of performance would have resulted. Also, if there is a bleed leak, the only solution would be to shut down the engine.		Preparing for a heavy landing (near max structural), we decided we could land flaps 30 with bleeds off to avoid having the outbound flight delayed due to brake temperature [quick turn around] weights using flaps 15. As stated in the checklist, bleeds off configuration should be accomplished after descending below 10,000 FT. Airport elevation at this airport is 8,300 FT, so this does not allow for much time, but we familiarized ourselves with the procedure and felt comfortable.		A B737-800 flight crew noted the right engine bleed had failed to close as required for their planned 'no engine bleed' 30 degree flap landing at a very high altitude airport. Because of lack of time and fuel to reconfigure the aircraft for either a reduced flap extension landing or a potentially thrust limited go-around they opted to land with flaps at 30 degrees, which they did uneventfully.

After arrival, I asked Mechanic Y to reactivate the spoilers to [perform] ops check on them. He seemed to be confused on the procedure even though he had the proper Maintenance Manual.  I am the Avionics (Electrician) and he is the Mechanic.  After a while he seemed confident the spoilers were reactivated. I swapped in a new Spoiler Computer to see if that would fix it, it did not.   I advised Mechanic X the Flight Fault was the right #1 spoiler actuator. He proceeded to change it. The indication in the cockpit got better, but was not in accordance with Maintenance Manual.  Mechanic Y at this point wanted to get back to ZZZ on the next flight. With the aid of the FBO Mechanic, they proceeded to deactivate the left and right #1 Spoilers and  re-defer the spoilers. I was packing up tools, parts and starting to clean the area up. With the aircraft released, we flew the same aircraft with the spoiler problem back to ZZZ. On approach into ZZZ, I first noticed a vibration in the First Class area. The vibration got worse and the aircraft was shaking. I was seated by the galley and could hear the equipment shake also. One Flight Attendant described it like a landing roll out, when the whole aircraft shakes with reversers deployed, but we were airborne. After landing, we were deplaning and the Captain wanted to talk to me in the cockpit. He asked me if I felt the shaking and I said yes. He stated this happened when the flaps were lowered. We agreed that the spoilers were floating. He also stated this aircraft was unsafe to fly and un-airworthy. I thought the plane was going to come unglued during the shaking from where I was seated. If I knew this was going to happen, I would not fly this aircraft or release it to the crew.  The Lead Mechanic verified on arrival at the gate that the #1 Spoilers were deflected up to two inches when they were supposed to be deactivated per MEL.  Mechanic Y also asked the Flight Attendants if they felt the shaking on the previous flight. The answer was no. There was no report of vibration on the previous flight. This all happened after the spoiler actuator was replaced.	Reporter stated the vibration and shaking began as soon as the flaps were lowered. The A320 spoilers are numbered one through five on both wings, with #1 spoiler being the most inboard spoiler near the fuselage and a ground spoiler only. Reporter stated that part of the procedure to deactivate the inboard ground spoilers was to try and lift the trailing edge of each deactivated spoiler to verify the spoiler actuator is properly locked-out and to prevent the type of spoiler float that occurred as soon as the flaps were lowered. He's not sure if Mechanic Y actually performed that procedure. Mechanic Y was quite concerned about getting back to ZZZ. Reporter stated the MEL Spoiler Deactivation procedures were revised to provide better clarity for mechanics.			A Line Avionics Mechanic reports he worked with another Mechanic to address a Flight Crew refusal of an A320 aircraft with deferred inboard ground spoilers. Efforts to correct problem were not successful. Inboard spoilers were deactivated and aircraft released. Aircraft experienced severe vibration on approach when flaps lowered.

Flight was progressing on ground normally. There was a small maintenance item on the arming of over-wing exit slide which was tended to. Flight left 17 minutes late out of gate. Climb out and cruise was normal. At approximately 2 hours into flight we both had our crew meals. The First Officer had the Ravioli, and I had the Teriyaki Steak dinner. Within 15 minutes of eating the meal, I started experiencing the onset of an allergic reaction. My eyes began to itch, my nose started to run, and my hands began to itch. The rate at which these symptoms appeared was familiar to me as I am severely allergic to certain food items (peanuts, pine nuts, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc.). Within 30 minutes of eating the crew meal, my tongue had swollen to the point where I was not able to speak understandably; my eyes had swollen to the point where my vision was significantly restricted; my breathing was labored. I am very familiar with my own reaction to these allergies and knew at that point I would be unable to perform my duties as the pilot flying and PIC. Fifteen minutes later I transferred flying duties and PIC duties to my First Officer. Fortunately, we had a jumpseater in the observer seat to aid the First Officer with altitude verifications and radio calls. We plugged him in with his headset from the observer's seat. At this point, I had no choice but to take 75 mgs of Benydryl to help lessen the effects of the allergic reaction. I also retrieved my Epi-Pen from my suitcase. I instructed the jump-seater on how to administer the Epi-Pen 'just in case.' During descent into our scheduled destination, I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch instructing them [to] contact Scheduling for replacement. They contacted my wife to pick me up from the airport. Upon arrival, I contacted the Duty Officer to relay the incident. I then proceeded immediately to the Emergency Room. There I received additional medication to counteract the allergic reaction and was released 3 hours later. Follow up treatment is steroids for 5 days with Benydryl. I ingested food that I am allergic too. Post a memo alerting flight crews about the possibility of being served crew meals that may cause allergic reactions.				An Air Carrier Captain described an incapacitating allergic (anaphylactic) reaction to his crew meal during flight which required the First Officer and Jumpseater to coordinate the remainder of the flight.

Significant roll of +/-10 degrees and brief light chop was experienced. The upset was enough to cause the flying pilot to implement our flight manual procedure for 'uncommanded roll' where the pilot disconnects the autopilot to manually regain aircraft control. Flight conditions at the time were day VMC with little or no wind and very smooth air. The smooth conditions made the wake encounter appear even more dramatic, prompting some comments from the flight attendants and one passenger after landing in IAH. The wake was clearly not severe enough to endanger the aircraft however, had the flight attendants been working the cabin with unsecured beverage carts this wake would have the potential for flight attendant or passenger injury. After the event, both pilots commented that we were glad we were not following a larger aircraft.				A B737-900 First Officer reported encountering wake vortex on arrival to IAH behind another B737.

A few minutes later the Purser called and reported that one of the aft flight attendants reported smelling 'sort of an electrical burning odor'. Through the course of several calls from the Purser it was established that 2 flight attendants and a space available ground service employee all smelled the odor, and that it was moving further aft throughout aircraft. The Captain determined, and I concurred, the best course was to declare an emergency and land [at the nearest suitable airport]. The Captain was still flying, and I called and declared emergency and asked direct to [the nearest suitable airport]. ATC immediately gave us a left turn direct to the airport, which the Captain via the autopilot started. In the turn the Captain transferred control of the aircraft to me, and he proceeded to coordinate with other parties. ATC gave us pilot discretion to FL200 then FL100 then controlled our descent after that. During the descent, the Captain and I briefed each other where we were at with the cabin, dispatch, and Center and the Captain re-assumed control of the aircraft as pilot flying. We continued descent into the airport receiving clearance direct to the 8 mile fix off the ILS flew the ILS and landed uneventfully. After landing, as there was no visible smoke or sign of immediate danger, we proceeded to a parking area and had passengers deplaned via an air stair.				A320 First Officer is informed by the Purser of a strange noise in the overhead and an electrical odor. After some discussion it is decided to divert to the nearest suitable airport. An uneventful landing ensues.

Passengers were also aware of odor and were voicing complaints and concerns to cabin crew. We responded to cabin crew to keep us informed if it got worse. We first attempted to mitigate/dissipate smell by switching to hi on packs selector with no noticeable results. We then attempted to isolate the source by alternately operating left and right air conditioning packs with no results. Smell continued to get worse according to cabin/passengers (although we had no detection or smell in cockpit). We then elected to accomplish fumes/smoke QRH.  Since passengers were complaining and concerned (as well as flight attendants) we elected to divert to a nearby airport.We did not declare emergency to ATC, however, we requested priority handling with a description of cabin fumes/odor issue. We accomplished the 'test' issues with cabin crew and accomplished a normal (but over weight) landing and proceeded to assigned gate. Station personnel were waiting for us. I had the passengers remain on board until conferring with dispatch and maintenance control, then arranged with station personnel to allow passengers into gate area for possible rebooking. I also arranged for medical personnel to be at gate and notified passengers that if anyone was feeling ill that they should inform EMT personnel. All 3 flight attendants were feeling ill and after conferring with the EMT personnel, elected to go to hospital to be checked out, as well as some of the passengers. Cabin crew was admitted and subsequently discharged. I arranged to have them RON.  Captain and First Officer suffered no ill effects except for a continuous low-grade head ache for me (Captain) that has lasted through the next day. All information documented in the maintenance log as well as cabin air safety report was faxed to Maintenance Control. There is indeed something that cause the fumes/odor, as they somewhat dissipated when thrust levers/power retarded for descent. I suspect either a seal/o-ring in engines or air cycle machines.  At no time was smell/odor detectable on flight deck.	The Reporter stated that the flight attendants in the aft cabin as well as some passengers complained of eye irritation, nasal/airway irritation and breathing difficulty. The smell was described a sulfuric in nature, and acrid as when a match head is struck during lighting. After the flight attendants third call the Reporter realized that the flight crew could not control the irritants entry and so decided to divert. At no point did the smell enter the cockpit but the Reporter did experience a low grade headache for two days after this event and he attributed it to whatever the chemical was because he virtually never gets headaches. He is aware of similar events on the B757 and the Airbus aircraft but his air carrier attributed the events to job actions and safety slow downs not mechanical malfunctions. The Reporter is now a firm believer that this event was real and caused by something originating in the aircraft. He has an A&P license and believes that whatever is causing this type event is a systemic issue which must be addressed before someone dies. All of the flight attendants are back at work with no apparent long term effects but Reporter states that is not the case with another crew which experienced a similar event and has been off work for months.			An A320 diverted because a sulfuric type odor in the cabin made flight attendants and passengers ill. Some required medical attention.

Based on all other engine indications (normal oil temperature/pressure), we suspected 'oil gulping.' After climbout/level off, oil quantity began increasing but never completely returned to a normal level. After cruising for approximately 30 minutes, the oil quantity decreased and oil pressure slowly started to erode. We reviewed QRH procedures for Low Oil Pressure/Precautionary Engine Shutdown/Landing with One Engine and made the decision to execute a precautionary engine shutdown if oil pressure indicated 'red' (13 PSI). We also worked a decision matrix for nearest suitable airfield if we had to shut down the engine. At the top of descent, oil pressure was not yet below minimums. Passing 25,000 FT the oil pressure went below minimums and we elected to shut down the engine, declare an emergency, and proceed to destination. Landing was uneventful. Rescue crews scanned and cleared the airplane. We taxied to the gate uneventfully.'Oil gulping' is an interesting event. We have received training time devoted to it at recurrent training. The theme seemed to be that crews were returning/shutting down engines when it was not needed. I would say this mindset led us to assume oil gulping and continue (although we monitored the engine continuously for any other abnormalities). There is no guidance in any of our official publications/QRH for oil gulping. I think it would be helpful to have some type of checklist to back up the crew when such an event occurs in flight. It would help the decision making process.		At rotation First Officer noticed engine oil quantity read zero. We recalled the letter regarding engine oil gulping. The First Officer found some reference in the Operations manual and FOM saying it happens during high power and initial climb but then slowly returns to normal and it is not a return to field event as long as oil pressure and oil temperature were normal. Engine indications remained normal and oil quantity slowly started to return but only reached 15% (approximately) engine parameters were normal. Numerous messages to Maintenance Control were sent. I think four. None were answered. We reviewed the engine shutdown procedures and monitored nearest suitable airports enroute along with drift down.About 100 miles out, oil pressure started to drop but oil temperature remained normal. APU was started in case of shutdown. While descending through about FL250, oil pressure dropped to 13 PSI (red box) and the QRH was followed and the engine was shutdown. An emergency was declared. Flight attendants were notified and equipment was rolled. A flap 15 landing was completed and a logbook entry was made. We found very little guidance on engine oil gulping. We would have found it helpful if Maintenance Control would have answered any of our messages. They did respond with (see you on the ground) after we told them the number two was shut down. The first message was sent informing them what was going on about an hour before we went single-engine.		B737-700 flight crew experiences low oil quantity during climb out with normal temperature and pressure. Oil gulping is suspected and the engine is monitored until pressure begins dropping during descent and the engine is shut down. A single engine landing ensues at destination ensues.

Disclaimer: Everyone involved acted professionally and the whole incident was 'FAR Legal'...BUT IT WAS NOT SAFE!! This problem is not limited to SOCAL Approach but is 'a system problem' at other high volume airports. (LGA, ORD, MIA etc.) While descending on the LAX ILS 25L approach, SOCAL Approach directed us to maintain 250 KTS as long as possible for spacing on an aircraft following us. To allow more time, SOCAL Approach directed us to descend well below the glide path to 2,000 MSL so we could make a quicker level altitude reduction in speed closer to the airport. Descending through 2,100 MSL, a TCAS target appeared on our display indicating an altitude of 1,900 MSL. The target was almost directly underneath us. Two seconds later, the TCAS issued an RA to climb. At the same time, SOCAL Approach recommended a climb. The white VFR aircraft banked to the right away from us as we climbed to 3,000 MSL. The rest of the approach and landing was uneventful. I spoke to the SOCAL Supervisor by telephone and was told that SOCAL owned the airspace 2,000 MSL and above, but there is an uncontrolled VFR corridor under that airspace. Often, 'foolish VFR pilots' fly their aircraft at 1,900 MSL under the big jets landing at LAX. Why would any VFR pilot chose to get so close to a big jet landing at LAX? Yes, I agree SOCAL was legal to descend us to 2,000 MSL. Yes, the VFR pilot was legal to fly at 1,900 MSL. But, WHY WAS SOCAL APPROACH SO WILLING TO RISK LIVES FOR SPACING INTO LAX? On this afternoon, our altimeter and the VFR aircraft's altimeter were reading correctly. Our TCAS system worked 'as advertised'. The SOCAL Controller picked up the VFR target 'in time'. But what happens next time? What if one of those safety chains breaks? Are we comfortable taking all this 'risk' just for 'aircraft spacing'? Did 500 FT of altitude make that much difference?				Air Carrier arrival to LAX described a conflict event when ATC descended their aircraft to 2,000 and a VFR aircraft apparently level near 1,900, all legal but very unsafe according to the reporter.

The Yellow system through the PTU kept the Green system pressurized normally. The First Officer was the pilot flying through the event as I handled the ECAM and coordinated contact events with Dispatch and flight attendants. I declared an emergency and coordinated a return to the departure airport. The First Officer landed uneventfully. Taxied to the gate was uneventful.

When he stated the item 'flaps,' he noted that the flap gauge was still at 25, although I had called for and he had selected flaps 40.  He confirmed with me his selection on the flap handle at 40 and I double checked it at 40.  We elected at that point to go around.  There was no split in the flap needles at all.  Go around was normal and we were vectored around for another approach.  While being vectored, we received permission to slow and configure early in order to determine what we had.  Slowed and configured to flaps 30, which we decided was good enough for the conditions. Configuration went normal and we returned to land with flaps 30.		While descending and preparing to land, my First Officer called for flaps at the appropriate airspeeds all the way down to, 'below 162 flaps 40.'  Upon looking at the TE Flaps indicator, we both noticed the Trailing Edge Flaps reading '25' not '40' with a 'green light'.  We both confirmed this and I insured that the flap lever was in the 40 degree notch - it was.  We were well ahead on the approach and fully stabilized by 2000 feet.  While approaching 1500 feet, with neither one of us sure of our flap position, I told the tower that we are going around.  We executed a normal go around with the flaps retracting normally all the way to the up position.  I then asked the controller for a heading and an altitude with speed at our discretion. They agreed and sent me on a heading at 6000 feet MSL.  We extended our flaps with the gear at the appropriate speeds down to 30 degree flaps.  All was normal.  I did not have a lot of fuel to play with, so I brought the flaps back up to 15 degree and left them there knowing that I could land with these If I had to, and I had approach bring me back in  for landing.  We set up for a 30 degree flap landing.  The flaps and the aircraft all behaved normally without any glitches.  By the time I got to the gate and shut down, my fuel was at 4200 lbs.  I did not want to drag around with 30 degree of flaps getting vectored for another approach.  I believe it was a good idea to bring the flaps back up to 15.  Throughout this event the aircraft behaved normally from a feel standpoint, if it was not for our checklist discipline to check the normal items that we are required to check before landing we would not have noticed this.  Bottom line, we did not know what flaps we had prior to landing because the indicator said 25 and the flap lever was at 40 so we went around and sorted it all out safely before landing.		B737-800 Flight Crew experiences flaps stuck at 25 with the flap handle set to 40 during approach and no warnings.  A go around is initiated followed by a flap 30 landing.

After quickly confirming with ATC that it was our aircraft, the Captain took the aircraft and aborted the takeoff at around 100 KIAS.  We did not have any abnormal indications in the flight deck. We exited, crossed the inside runway, and requested fire trucks to inspect the number one engine and brakes.  In the meantime, we completed the RTO QRH procedure and checked the brake energy.  Once the Fire Chief gave us the clear and the brake cooling performance was checked, we taxied and shut down to be towed into the gate.		During the reject, the same aircraft reported that the flames extinguished. No abnormal cockpit indications were noted.		A B737-700 Captain rejected the takeoff at about 100 kts after another aircraft reported flames out of the number one engine during a night takeoff. The aircraft returned to the gate.

Flaps 1+F. Once aligned with the runway I handed control of the airplane to the First Officer. He spooled the engines to 1.05 EPR and then advanced the thrust levers to the flex detent. I then put my hand on the thrust levers and made sure they were firmly in the proper detent. #2 engine came up to speed properly. I noticed #1 engine wouldn't accelerate past 1.25 or 1.26 EPR. I assumed control of the airplane and rejected the takeoff. We were in the low speed regime and the autobrakes never activated and we had to disarm them manually so the entire maneuver was completed below 72 KTS. We cleared the runway and returned to the gate.I have no idea why the engine did not produce takeoff thrust. Having said that, I wasn't going to wait and see what would happen, risk accelerating into the high speed regime, and then rejecting the takeoff. In my opinion we did the safest thing we could. Under the same circumstances, I would do the same thing.		Once aligned with runway I received controls from Captain. I spooled the engines to 1.05 EPR and then advanced the thrust levers to the flex detent. I removed my hand from the thrust levers noted the power was coming up and moved my eyes outside the aircraft to continue with the takeoff. The Captain then rejected the takeoff and I handed controls of the aircraft to him. We exited the runway after the low speed reject and he explained that #1 engine was slow spooling up and never reached takeoff power (1.26 EPR). Auto brake never actuated. Contacted Maintenance and returned to gate. Brake temperatures were less than 300 C.		A320 flight crew experiences low EPR on the number one engine during attempted takeoff and rejects at low speed.

We saw green and yellow radar returns indicating thunderstorms (TRW) building ahead, with tops at/near our altitude on our route of flight. After evaluation we determined that we needed to deviate altitude or course to avoid possible turbulence and adverse weather. [We] requested CPDLC altitude change to climb above radar returns (yellow/green) ahead. Shortly after requesting, Shanwick's CPDLC response was 'Unable due to traffic'. [We] continued on SLOP R1 analyzing weather and options. Determined I needed to utilize emergency authority to deviate. Eight minutes later began deviation from R1 SLOP to R12 to remain clear of buildups/cloud ceiling/yellow radar returns directly ahead. Focus was outside looking for possible aircraft and monitoring track/course deviation. Five minutes later sent CPDLC free text message, 'DV8ing 12 south for TRW.' [We] remained at FL350. Transmitted on 123.45 our position, altitude and deviation distance off Track W. Received two SelCal's from Shanwick, but upon attempting to communicate, Shanwick was unreadable. (Solar storm was impacting HF.) Several minutes later, answered another SelCal and was advised that Shanwick 'was filing' on the incident because our deviation had violated standard separation with two other aircraft. I asked for the flight numbers of the other flights, which was provided. Requested separation distances and after several minutes, was told 'Shanwick is too busy. It will be in the report.' Contacted these flights and plotted their positions at the time in question. (Note: All aircraft 'involved' were at FL350, Mach .83.) [There appeared to be no loss of separation.] We were in day VMC at all times, just above a cloud deck and deviating to the right of the TRW, lights on, at FL350. 'Aviate, navigate, communicate' priorities dictated that we avoid the cells as our first priority, and maintain traffic watch as a second priority. Contacted Dispatch on Satellite Phone and informed them of situation. They indicated that they had received some message traffic on the incident.				Captain exercises his emergency authority to deviate around a thunderstorm on the North Atlantic Tracks, after a request to Shanwick Oceanic via CPDLC is denied. Shanwick indicated that a loss of standard separation occurred during this incident.

I checked the difference between Flaps 5 (approximately 1000 foot stopping margin) and Flaps 10 ( approximately 1600 foot stopping margin) and concurred that Flaps 10 was better. This was the first Flaps 10 takeoff that I have done in literally several years. It's always Flaps 5. After start I called to set Flaps 5 like always and the First Officer complied just like every flight.  We ran the checklist and all was just as normal (except we had the wrong flap setting). Taxi out was normal but a little busy with the airport construction going on combined with night operations. We were cleared for takeoff and, just about the time I hit the TOGA button, my First Officer said, 'S***, Flaps 10' and instantly slapped the lever to 10. That startled me and delayed what should have been an abort.  After one or two seconds (while my brain was trying to process what just happened), the Takeoff Warning horn beeped about two or three times.  I looked up saw the flaps at 10 and the speed going past 80 knots (spring loaded to only abort for fire or failure) and I elected to continue the takeoff. The takeoff and clean-up were otherwise normal. This whole event occurred in about three seconds. By the time I reacted, the airspeed was past 80 knots and going up and I made the snap decision that the safest action at that point was to continue rather than abort.   I do not feel the threat/problem to be complacency so much as habit. 99.9% of my takeoffs have been Flaps 5 so I was totally spring loaded into that routine.  Kudos to my First Officer for catching the mistake.				After planning a 10 degree flap takeoff due to their aircraft's planned weight and a short runway, the B737-700 flight crew, out of habit, set five degrees instead.  Shortly after the start of the takeoff roll the First Officer realized the error and reset the flaps to 10 degrees and the takeoff was continued.

Normal taxi with no abnormal brake indications noted. The Captain had briefed an abort in the low speed regime for anything prior to departure. We were cleared for takeoff and the controls were transferred to me as we lined up and I applied FLEX Take Off power. At approximately 75 KTS, an ECAM and Master Caution light came on. I looked down briefly and saw 'BRAKES HOT' ECAM. At the same time, the Captain announced, 'aborting' and retarded the power levers to idle. RTO braking was engaged and the aircraft quickly came to a stop. The Captain was unable to disengage the autobrakes with the brake pedals and had to de-select the autobrake switch. I advised ATC when the abort began and the Captain announced 'Remain Seated' on the PA as the aircraft came to a stop. We exited the runway and requested the emergency equipment to come to inspect our brakes. We were given taxi instructions to cross Runway XX and enter the XX hold pad. The Captain held the brakes and we shut down the engines. The Fire Department inspected the brakes and their readings concurred with our indicated brake temperatures, which peaked at 605 C on the #1 brake and was above 500 C on the others. We talked to Dispatch on and patched through to Maintenance. After the brakes had cooled we arranged for a gate to return to and taxied back to a gate with the fire department following. At the gate, we had the aircraft chocked and turned the aircraft over to Maintenance for inspection. We were given another aircraft and continued the flight uneventfully. I don't believe significant human factors were involved.		Spoke to flight attendants and found out they have different evacuation terminology and a bit of a gray area with what they are to observe and if they need to stay seated or stand up and assess the situation. In this case, it was better for them to be seated due to movement of the aircraft off the active runway.		An A320 ECAM alerted 'BRAKES HOT' at 75 KTS on the takeoff roll so the Captain rejected the takeoff and requested ARFF inspection before taxiing to the gate. Flight Attendants stated that cabin crew procedures are different from flight crew's.

We were dispatched in accordance with MEL XXXX (center #2 boost pump inoperative). After takeoff, we noticed that the center #1 boost pump failed to start feeding the engines. We monitored the fuel system and referenced the flight manual. The fuel panel configuration from the MEL compliance was XFEED-ON after takeoff. This created a fuel imbalance and subsequent fuel auto feed fault ECAM (even though the center tank was not feeding). Accomplishing the auto feed fault ECAM, we selected fuel mode select to manual. This started the center #1 pump feeding to the engines. At this point we were going to call Dispatch and Maintenance to conference, but we then got a BCL 2 (Battery Control Limiter) fault ECAM. At this point we were at FL360 and elected to divert. We declared an emergency and landed overweight (146,400 LBS). The diversion was uneventful. Upon conferencing with Maintenance it was determined that the underlying problem was a fuel auto feed system malfunction. Since we didn't need center tank fuel to continue to our destination we accepted the additional deferral for fuel auto feed fault and continued. The divert station folks, supervisors, customer service representatives, mechanics, and fueler could not have provided more superior service for our diversion. They are all to be commended.				An A320's #2 center fuel tank boost pump was MEL'd and after takeoff the crew had difficulty starting the #1 Center Fuel Boost pump, so they declared an emergency and diverted. While troubleshooting the fuel problem the BCL2 ECAM alerted.

In a conversation with a company Mechanic yesterday, I learned that [one of our] B737-800 aircraft had a takeoff engine failure out of ZZZ. From what I gathered from the conversation, the engine that failed had a history of problems yet was continually approved for further flights right up until the time of failure. His implication was Management's fix for the problem was lets keep it out of ZZZ1, but keep flying it. He also stated that he learned that there was a Management decision in order to save money, not to have spare engines. I do not know if this is true. We as pilots have been screaming that Maintenance is broken and must be fixed. It falls on deaf ears when we say it, but where is the FAA in this. The history of this aircraft is not a secret. Pulling a KVA [Generator] on this aircraft verifies that it is a ticking time bomb. My concern is of FAA oversight and company Management accountability. Please correct me if I am wrong, but this is a trend, yet nothing [has been] done to address it.	Reporter stated he was referring to one of their company B737-800 aircraft, that he also flies that had an engine failure and a history of mechanical malfunctions that ended with a contained failure of the CFM-56 engine on departure, at 1,500 FT above ground. The incident was not an unforeseen engine failure. That particular aircraft was being monitored and deliberately routed for domestic routes and low altitude, long runways, which was why Maintenance Control/ Dispatch kept the aircraft out of ZZZ1 with the short runways.Reporter stated that as a pilot, he has no problem flying an aircraft knowing that abnormal situations may develop at any given time.  But there is a big difference between an unexpected 'Abnormal' mechanical situation and an 'Expected' mechanical failure that Maintenance knows will eventually occur, especially with repetitive sign-offs of chronic aircraft malfunctions.  He has seen a trend develop over the past ten years, a 'LAISSEZ-FAIRE' type attitude his company Management has taken towards aircraft maintenance issues. He is hoping the FAA will address these types of issues.			A B737-800 pilot reports about his concerns with the limited FAA oversight of his Air Carrier's Maintenance practices involving repetitive sign-offs of chronic aircraft malfunctions that eventually lead to 'expected' failures.

We performed the abnormal checklist for the hydraulic system, climbed to FL70 and advised ATC of planning to dump fuel and return for landing.  The fuel dump checklist was accomplished as well as the emergency landing checklist.  Due to the normal difficulty with communication with this TRACON, the First Officer was busy with the checklist while I was flying so I instructed the Relief Pilot to advise the flight attendants via the normal TEST information while at the same time, the Relief Pilot was contacting the company.  After things settled down I made a PA to the passengers advising of the situation and to follow flight attendants instruction and that emergency vehicles would be present as a precaution.  We returned to an uneventful landing.  After gate arrival I was informed by several flight attendants that they were never instructed to perform their emergency landing checklist so that was not accomplished.  I was under the impression that by giving the TEST briefing and time for the planned landing that this was their instructions to begin their emergency landing procedures,but apparently that was not the case.				A B777 right hydraulic system failed after takeoff so an emergency was declared and the aircraft returned to land. The flight attendants were not prepared to land because of a TEST briefing confusion.

They detected this through their ground RADAR, and it indicated a vehicle entering the runway at, I believe, Taxiway WC. I aborted the takeoff and cleared the runway joining the Eastbound parallel and held short of D1 Taxiway. We told the passengers to remain seated, and shutdown our engines. Airport operations first showed, then the fire department. The fire department chocked our nose gear, so we could release our brakes. They did their inspection and everything checked out okay. While all this was happening I also communicated with flight Dispatch, informed them of the incident and got Maintenance Control in the loop. They dispatched a Team to inspect my tires, and eventually towed me in. Hottest brake temp was about 710 degrees. My First Officer talked to Tower while I was communicating with others and found out the vehicle incident was a false alarm. I'm sure there were things I could have done better, but overall the incident worked out well with the help I got from all parties involved.		I was the First Officer on a flight from Denver. The weather was VFR but deteriorating due to an incoming gust front and rain. We were cleared to take off from Tower on Runway 34L. At 110 KTS Denver Tower said 'Aircraft X take off clearance canceled.' The Captain initiated an abort per SOP. I told Denver Tower, 'Aircraft X aborting on Runway 34L.' When below 60 KTS and everything seemed under control, I told the crew and passengers on the PA to remain seated as we were beginning to taxi off the runway and we did not want the crew prematurely opening the doors and slides as we came to a stop. The Captain taxied off the runway and came to a stop. As he spoke to the crew and passengers I coordinated initially with Ground and Maintenance for overheating brakes. Max temperature of brakes reached 660/630 left and 680/705 right brakes. We were 148,000 LBS and the outside temperature was 29C. An emergency was never declared as it was deemed unnecessary. Denver Tower was professional and somewhat apologetic because they canceled the take off clearance due to an alarm indicating vehicles on the runway. This was a false alarm and they indicated they could not verify vehicles on the runway because of the gust front and approaching rain reducing their visibility. We told them better safe than sorry, basically they did their job and we did ours.		Air Carrier on departure role from DEN was issued a 'cancel take off clearance' by ATC at about 110 KTS. After the abort ATC indicated that a 'false alarm' on their equipment dictated the action taken.

I became distracted by other preflight duties and cabin concerns. We conducted a thorough preflight of the documents and manuals in the cockpit but missed the QRH's. I will make sure in the future not to omit this item, and make sure it does not happen again. Jet Librarians should remove manuals only after verifying the new manuals are on board.		While in cruise flight midway on the North Atlantic Tracks the Captain (pilot not flying) asked me (pilot flying) to see the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) on my side. I discovered it was not in its assigned slot. The Captain stated the QRH on his side was also not in its assigned slot. We thoroughly searched the cockpit and were unable to find the QRH's on board. This handbook is required for flight and our crew would not have departed had we realized the ship's QRH was not on board. Both the Captain and other First Officer did have the QRH available to them on their laptops. Reference to the QRH was not needed on this flight. The flight continued to an uneventful landing and we wrote up the missing QRH's in the ship's logbook.		A330 flight crew reports discovering enroute that the QRH's normally stored on the aircraft are missing. Copies of the QRH are available on personal laptop computers but are not needed on this flight.

My First Officer read back the instructions and as I was slowing the aircraft down a second Tower Controller said, 'Correction, hold short of 30R on Delta.' I understood this to mean exit at Delta and passed up M1 for the Delta Taxiway exit. As all this was happening, one of the controllers issued takeoff clearance to a corporate jet on Runway 35. As I was passing M1, Tower told us to stop and canceled the corporate jet's takeoff clearance. I stopped the aircraft short of [Runway] 35 and looked over my shoulder to find other aircraft. He had barely started to roll so he was stopped also. Tower asked us if we were unable to make M1. I told them that I was confused by the second transmission and asked them what they wanted me to do now. Tower instructed us to exit at Delta and hold short 30R. The taxi to the gate was uneventful. The First Officer and I talked about the event after shutting down the aircraft at the gate. Both of us agree that the first instruction was crystal clear. The second transmission was unnecessary. We both thought the second transmission wanted us to exit at Delta. We were not confused until the Tower told us to stop. That's when we realized what was happening. This all happened within a few seconds. My question is, why would Tower issue takeoff instructions on a runway [that] crosses our runway before they were sure we were going to make the exit they wanted us on. We were prepared to exit at M1, but the second Controller's direction didn't mention M1. After talking to our ATC Manager, we both think there was probably training going on in the Tower. Houston has varsity controllers that really know how to move metal on and off runways. When they are training, they probably need to slow things down a little.				Air carrier landing HOU on Runway 30L was instructed to exit at M1, hold short of [Runway] 30R at Delta and then issued different instructions from another Controller. Confused, the crew exited at Delta causing an aborted takeoff from Runway 35.

After checklist was completed and while we were burning down fuel, we found right trailing edge skew circuit breaker was out. Reset circuit breaker and extended the flaps with the ALT system and then landed normally.		Called Maintenance and they told us to look for circuit breakers. We found left flap skew CB out. I pushed it in and since we had the electric pump already on (per checklist), the left flap matched up with the right.Nowhere in the 'No Flaps' Checklist did it tell us to look at the circuit breakers, so thanks to the Maintenance guy.		A B737-700 flight crew was unable to extend trailing edge flaps symmetrically until directed by Maintenance to check the associated circuit breakers. After discovering and resetting an open TE skew CB, the flaps extended fully using the ALT system.

Passing FL290 the autopilot kicked off. I tried to reengage the autopilot with no success. At that time we got an ECAM NAV ADR 1 Fault, Autopilot Off and GPWS Fault. The Captain instructed me to fly the airplane and talk to ATC while he ran the ECAM. After finishing the ECAM and running through the appropriate procedures, we had lost numerous systems necessary for auto flight. I now was hand flying the aircraft. The Captain discussed the situation with Dispatch and Maintenance and after working through the appropriate procedures decided to divert. He exercised Captain's Emergency Authority to recycle FMGC 1 and 2 Circuit Breaker. Despite running all appropriate procedures we were unable to return the aircraft to normal flight. We did not declare an emergency with ATC. We descended [below RVSM] and flew block altitudes to the divert airport. We also burned down our fuel in order to land under max landing weight. The landing was uneventful. After arriving at the gate, we debriefed with Operations and Maintenance.		We determined we had lost auto pilots, auto throttles, flight directors and autoflight guidance as well as airspeed indications.		After suffering multiple autoflight and instrument failures the flight crew of an A320 descended out of RVSM airspace and diverted uneventfully for maintenance.

I was told this aircraft just came over from the hangar, where it had the #2 engine changed. This was its first flight. We were prepared for a flex takeoff and did all the necessary procedures, including loading the flex temp in the FMGC. When cleared for takeoff, I advanced the throttles to 1.05 EPR and both engines stabilized normally. Upon advancing the throttles to the flex detent, I read out MAN FLEX on the FMA. Simultaneously, I felt the aircraft pull right of centerline. Something felt wrong. I was correcting with left rudder when we got an ECAM. I aborted at approximately 60 KTS. I believe the ECAM was, 'ENG - THR Levers Not Set'. However, it disappeared when I pulled the throttles back to idle. It would not recall. We coordinated a return to the gate after working with Maintenance. The #2 engine did not make takeoff thrust or was slow to spool up. The FMGC, throttle position and FMAs were correct for a flex takeoff.				On the first takeoff after an engine change the new engine on an A320 failed to accelerate to takeoff thrust, the takeoff was rejected and the aircraft returned to the gate for maintenance.

We had no green lights or ECAM indicating that the gear was down and locked, however it 'sounded' as though the gear was down. We executed a go around at approximately 1,500 FT AGL. Earlier in the approach we flew through moderate rain-producing clouds which generated excessive static electrical discharges. We were clear of clouds and rain approximately 5 miles outside of FAF in VMC. We flew north of the airport to work the problem. We first consulted the aircraft FM and found no procedure addressing the problem of no gear down indication. We then, through ACARS, asked Dispatch to call us to discuss our situation with them along with Maintenance Control. However, after numerous attempts we were unable to make contact with them. After debating all options we decided to declare an emergency, and return lowering landing gear normally and make a normal approach and landing. When we lowered the gear outside the FAF, all indications were normal. Landing was uneventful. Maintenance believes that we probably had a lightning strike and that we had momentarily lost our 1 LGCIU.				A320 pilot reports no green gear indications or ECAM indications after gear extension during approach. After trouble shooting a second approach is accomplished and the gear indicates normally. Flight flew through clouds which generated excessive static electrical discharges during the first approach.

We did not encounter a roll and we completed the QRH and subsequent procedures. We descended to FL290 and slowed to Mach .65. Upon maneuvering for landing at flaps 15 in gusty conditions, we had a very brief stick shaker. We increased our speed a few knots and landed without incident.		...we descended to FL290 in order to observe a new speed limitation of Mach .65, or 300 KTS. On final approach we noticed the malfunction light did not go away when we configured for landing so we went around and followed the QRH as it pertains to the Landing Configuration Caution light. Upon attempting another visual approach at flaps 15, I briefly observed a Stall Warning stick shaker. I advanced the power immediately and recovered from the stall warning, although I don't know if I used emergency thrust. On final, airspeed indications were unreliable so in order to avoid another stall warning, I increased airspeed 20 KTS over what was target on my Airspeed indicator and landed without incident.		A B737-700 flight crew dealt with a malfunctioning Leading Edge flap.

We were being vectored for the visual approach landing north in SEA. There were several other aircraft being vectored to parallel runways and we were following a B737 about five miles ahead. Approach did not assign a runway until the final vector to intercept final. They told us to follow traffic ahead and intercept 34R. We complied and about 30 seconds later they told us we were cleared for the visual 34C. I asked clarification on the runway assignment. They apologized and reconfirmed 34C. We were now three to four miles in trail of traffic ahead and the First Officer began to slow and configure. On about a six mile final and about three miles in trail, we flew into some moderate wake turbulence. The First Officer disconnected the autopilot and I asked him to fly slightly above the glidepath. We completed the Before Landing Checklist and the rest of the approach was uneventful. I did not catch the fact that we were not sent over to Tower. We still landed on Approach frequency and switched over upon clearing the runway. Tower cleared us across 34R and we taxied uneventfully to the gate. My attention was diverted with the runway changes and wake turbulence on final. I normally turn on the Outboard Landing lights with the clearance to land from Tower. As we cleared the runway and I took the aircraft, went to stow the speedbrake, and turn off the landing lights (outboards were not on), I realized we were not on Tower. The First Officer made the frequency change as we cleared.				A B737-700 flight crew reported landing without clearance after a wake vortex encounter distracted them on final.

The air carrier reported traffic alerts and claims Cirrus is not at 4,500 MSL...much closer. Approach gave us the same traffic, 12 o'clock, 4,500 MSL and VFR. We did not have visual contact, but the Cirrus reported us in sight (said he had our lights). As we closed, we got simultaneous 'Traffic' and 'Climb, Climb' RA alerts. Cirrus showed 400 below moving to 300 below.  The First Officer who was pilot flying began a climb away from traffic in response to the RA. I advised Approach who replied that the Cirrus 'said he was at 4,500 FT and radar confirms'. We climbed to approximately 5,400 FT and the RA ended as traffic passed below us and slightly right of the nose. I caught a glimpse of the Cirrus passing to the right and he indeed did not look to be anywhere near 500 FT below us (or in this case it should have been 900 FT with our climb). I could see the occupants clearly. I advised Approach we were returning to our assigned altitude and in response got a frequency change and 'that was that'.				While in terminal airspace two air carrier aircraft sequentially followed TCAS Resolution Advisories with respect to a Cirrus aircraft apparently well above his assigned altitude and conflicting with that of the air carriers.

I am sure that I spotted at least 20-30 gulls feeding and flying around the boat, which was directly below the approach to 4R (approx 1/8-1/4 mile from end of Runway at approximately 200-400 FT). I do not know if the Mass Port Authority or Airport Authority has any control or influence over this, but it would seem like a very dangerous situation to be intentionally attracting this many birds directly below a very busy approach path.

The mask would not inflate and was no longer usable. Exercising Captain's Emergency Authority, I instructed the First Officer to remove his O2 mask from its storage compartment and we would replace it with the O2 mask from the First Observer's seat, as that seat was unoccupied. After donning my oxygen mask, he left his seat to retrieve the Observer's mask and then installed it at the First Officer mask location. He tested the new mask for proper operation including the microphone and we continued the flight to destination.		About two hours from destination, we had a physiological break. I was donning my oxygen mask when the green hose seal burst. The mask was unusable. The Captain donned his oxygen mask and directed me to swap my mask with the First Observer's mask.

Pre-departure, taxi, and takeoff [were] normal. The First Officer (FO) was hand flying the aircraft. As we passed through FL190, the Purser called and informed me the aft Flight Attendant reported smelling a strong electrical smell with no visible smoke present. I asked him to keep me informed. I advised the FO and told Center we might have a problem and needed to level off at FL210. The Purser called again at which time I gave the radios to the FO and answered. He said the smell was very strong and they were very concerned. They removed all power from the cabin. I asked him if he believes it's serious enough to divert, which [he] answered yes. I informed the FO and told him that I think we should land at ZZZ since we were directly abeam the airport; he concurred. We declared an emergency, informed Center of our issue and turned toward ZZZ. The Purser called back and said the smell is very strong and he sounded very worried. I told him we are diverting to ZZZ and will be on the ground in 5 minutes. The FO was flying the aircraft and talking to the controllers. I sent a short ACARS message to Dispatch and started focusing on where the aircraft was. The FO did an excellent job and had already put a new destination in the MCDU, pulled up weather, and had his charts out. I thought it would be a good idea for him to continue flying so I could catch up, which he concurred. He briefed the approach and just about then the Purser called and said the aft flight attendants were putting their protective breathing equipment on (later turned out he had said they were pulling them out and I may have miss understood). This made the situation very serious to me. I asked for the aircraft and pushed the speed up and received direct clearance for [the runway] at ZZZ. We landed uneventfully and made the turn off where the emergency vehicles were waiting. On short final, I asked the FO to contact the Purser for an update. We were informed the smell had gone away so we told the flight attendants we would not evacuate and also told the Fire Marshal of the status in the back and that we would stop by them and not evacuate unless they see or tell us other wise. All seemed normal to the Fire Marshal and no sign of heat or smoke so we taxied to gate. I asked the passengers to deplane in an orderly fashion and leave their carry on items. Every one - the flight attendants, First Officer, passengers, and ground support - were excellent.				A320 flight crew is informed by the Purser during climb of electrical fumes in the aft galley. Flight Attendants turn off all galley equipment and the flight crew elects to divert to the nearest suitable airport after declaring an emergency. Smoke dissipates prior to landing and aircraft is taxied to the gate.

The other MCDU was similarly frozen. About 1 1/2 minutes elapsed until entries were accepted and actions began to occur in the MCDU (unfroze). The Thales box is non-airworthy and Thales/Airbus should be notified that this is so, and that they are responsible for the ramifications thereof.	The Reporter was extremely knowledgeable about the FMGC, the various revisions, the 'misbehaviors' that came with the various revisions and some work arounds for same. The anomaly which his report described still does not have an explanation, but other similar dual FMGC freezes do have work arounds such as the NO STAR freeze which results when an aircraft transitions from an arrival route to an arrival heading for a vector. The proper procedure is to select the required heading, delete the manual heading LEG, then select NO STAR after which the pilot can begin building the assigned runway approach. If a turn is made, NO STAR selected before the manual heading is deleted then a dual FMGC lockup occurs. There is a known lockup 'misbehavior' on the SEA CHINS arrival when transitioning from IMB toward RADDY. Also if alternate routes are programmed into the primary route, then the secondary route, if an anomalous behavior is entered in the secondary route, a dual FMGC lockup occurs. If an aircraft flies within 5 miles of an inbound fix while being vectored outbound the FMGC locks up. A newer issue has come up in a feature called 'enhanced localizer' which made a recent arrival unstable when the aircraft pitched over, descending rapidly below profile. The Reporter believes that the FMGC digital processor and bus have been overloaded resulting in the anomalies which they are experiencing now.			Both A320 FMGC's on an A320 with the Thales FMS Release 1A installed locked up after a landing runway change entry, but subsequently reset after about a minute and a half.

Approximately two seconds after takeoff thrust was achieved we received a Master Caution light and an Aft Entry Door light on the overhead panel. I initiated a Rejected Takeoff (RTO) and complied with the boxed/memory items. Along with the First Officer and a Company Pilot on the jumpseat, we all concurred the maximum airspeed achieved was 58 KTS. I called for the RTO Checklist in the QRH and the First Officer informed the Tower of our aborted takeoff and we would not need assistance. We completed the RTO Checklist and the brake performance review, which indicated no brake cooling or logbook inspection requirements (9.1 million FT/LBS of energy). We taxied clear of the runway and parked on the tarmac still without the use of the parking brake. I explained the situation to the passengers, sent an ACARS to my Dispatcher, and contacted the flight attendants on the Service interphone. I had the 'B' Flight Attendant recycle the Aft Entry Door and the door light remained extinguished. We accomplished the Before Push, Before Taxi, and Before Takeoff Checklists. Additionally, we reviewed the Door Light Checklist and emphasized we would not abort on the subsequent takeoff for a door light above 80 KTS. There was no mechanical problem with the aircraft after the Aft Entry door was cycled, thus, no need to return to the gate for maintenance. The subsequent takeoff and flight was uneventful. While enroute, my Dispatcher sent an ACARS stating that Maintenance Control might want an information only writeup in the logbook about the door upon arrival. Upon shutdown in the Operations Agent informed me there was a contract Mechanic in the jetway to inspect the aft entry door. Maintenance Control, on their initiative, sent the Mechanic to inspect the door. I contacted Maintenance Control through my Dispatcher and informed them there was nothing mechanically wrong with the door. The Maintenance Controller indicated he wanted an information only writeup in the logbook about the door light since we aborted the takeoff. I referenced FOM Information Only Item Actions and informed him that this situation did not qualify for an information only writeup. He politely requested that I get an opinion from the Chief Pilot. I explained the situation to the Chief Pilot and he agreed that all of my actions taken were appropriate and that a pilot logbook entry was not required. Maintenance Control had the Contract Mechanic inspect the door anyway and document the inspection in the logbook. The logbook writeup was something to the effect of, 'Per Maintenance Control's request, an inspection of the Aft Entry Door was performed in accordance with MM XXXX. No defects noted.' The Contract Mechanic signed off his own writeup and we departed. The Chief Pilot requested that I complete this report. An Irregularity Report was also completed. I suppose since Rejected Takeoffs are very rare and highly scrutinized by the FAA, an abundance of caution exists in [the] maintenance and dispatch [of aircraft]. Possibly the Maintenance Controller confused this situation with an information only writeup resulting from an erroneous takeoff warning that activates on takeoff. If a logbook entry had been required, I understand that it would have been accomplished before departure. The Contract Mechanic waiting on us in could have given someone the incorrect appearance that we departed with a defective entry door. That was not the case. I did not mind having the door inspected, even though that was not required, I just disagreed that this situation fell under the criteria of an information only writeup.				A B737-700 Captain rejected a takeoff at 58 KTS because of Master Caution and Aft Entry Door lights. Both lights extinguished so the QRH was consulted and a normal takeoff followed.

We continued and completed the landing with normal indications. Once on the ground the ECAM disappeared. I contacted Maintenance Control and wrote it up in the logbook. One theory of a recent overwater high altitude accident is that the TAT probe filled with water while flying through a thunderstorm and iced up, negatively impacting pitot/static systems. The heavy rain we encountered prior to landing may have done the same since we had a strong 30 KTS cross wind coming from the Captain's side, potentially filling the TAT probe with water. We were not at altitude so there was no icing potential. We experienced no obvious difference in air speed or altitude indication. I believe the aircraft manufacturer, the NTSB, the FAA, Maintenance and our company need to address this issue.				An A320 flight crew received an ECAM Capt TAT warning on short final in heavy rains. They made a safe landing after which the message disappeared. Maintenance was advised.

ATC queried us as we stopped the descent at 8,500 FT MSL and climbed back to 9,000 FT prior to EDDNA. Confusion over why some altitudes dropped out and did not recognize one was still missing. Less time spent on the why and more on what is missing.				A320 Captain reports an altitude deviation during the MAIER 4 RNAV arrival to PHX. After deviating around weather and returning to the arrival several crossing restrictions were noted to have dropped out. All but one were reinserted.

Preflight, pre-departure, taxi out, takeoff and initial climb were all normal.  Sometime during climbout, I noticed a very slight airframe vibration and an associated barely audible hum.  I would guess this appeared in the 5000-10,000 msl range.  All engine indications were in the normal range.  We did notice the left engine vibration monitor showed 4.5-4.7 and was gray boxed.  We subsequently noticed the L engine EGT was approximately 60-70 degrees hotter than the R engine, but the L engine EGT was well within the normal range. Approximately at that time, we received a call from a Flight Attendant regarding a vibration and noise being noticed at door 3R and 3L.  The Relief pilot left the cockpit to assess the vibration. The Captain took control of the radios while I consulted the B777 Flight Manual regarding the vibration.  A check of the Limits section did not reveal any reference to the vibration monitor.  The Systems section of the manual only said that the range of the monitor is 0.0-5.0 and there was no reading that was considered abnormal. The Relief pilot returned to the cockpit to relay that she too noticed the noise and vibration, although it was not very noticeable to the passengers.  She did think it was abnormal.  The Captain decided then to call Dispatch and phone patch through to Maintenance.  At this time, I took the aircraft and radios.  I continued our climb with Center, I believe the clearance was to climb and maintain FL280.  Soon thereafter, the aircraft yawed noticeably to the left and back to the right, and we noticed the L engine gauges began to be unstable.  The Captain immediately took control of the aircraft and I grabbed the QRH and began to run the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall checklist.  We completed the initial steps of the checklist when the aircraft yawed again and the L engine EGT went into the RED range.  This was followed IMMEDIATELY by heavy acrid smoke in the cockpit.  At that time the autopilot disengaged and the associated warning was sounding in the cockpit.  We immediately donned our oxygen masks and established crew communication.  The aircraft continued yawing back and forth, the smoke continued to increase in intensity, and the autopilot warning was still sounding.  Considering we already had the L throttle at idle, we immediately recognized and announced severe engine damage.  I made a transmission to ATC that we were an emergency aircraft, had smoke in the cockpit and requested an immediate descent and vector towards the airport. At this time, I went to run the QRH for Severe Engine Damage.  I could not find the QRH.  The smoke was intensifying to the point of it being difficult to see the Captain.  If it continued to intensify, it would approach the point of beginning to obscure instrument visibility.  The EGT was in the RED, the aircraft continued to yaw, and I believe the autopilot alarm continued to sound.  I reverted to system knowledge for severe engine damage and confirmed the L fuel control switch and placed it in Cutoff.   Our attention as a crew immediately was drawn to the amount of smoke in the cockpit.  It was heavy and acrid.  I consulted the ECL [B777 Electronic Check List] and began to run the Smoke/Fumes/Fire checklist.  This checklist was not too difficult to find, but it did take some time.  Once there, it took considerable time to complete and was very cumbersome.  While running this checklist, the smoke finally began to dissipate.  The checklist was completed.  During all of my checklist running, The Captain and Relief pilot handled ATC and flight attendant coordination.  By this time, we were nearing the airport.  After consultation, we decided to land overweight instead of delaying our landing to dump fuel or complete checklists.  We were not 100% sure our smoke source had been dealt with.  I consulted the overweight landing checklist in the ECL.  That checklist was completed.  It was followedby the Final Descent Checklist.  We planned for and completed a Flaps 20 approach and landing.  Our Ref speed was 161 and we used autobrakes 4.  The ground prox flaps override switch was placed to override.  The approach and landing were normal.  Moderate braking was used.  Upon stopping on the taxiway, we established communication with the emergency vehicles.  They monitored our brake temperatures and used water to keep them cool. Since the smoke had begun to dissipate, we decided to not evacuate the aircraft.  Passengers were eventually deplaned via mobile lounges.  The crew remained with the aircraft  until we were towed to a gate.  Eventually during the final descent, the QRH was located between my seat and the center pedestal.  I now realize it was dropped from my hands in my haste to don my oxygen mask.  In the duress of the moment including the smoke and darkness, I was unable to locate the QRH.  It was leaning vertically between the seat and pedestal and would be almost invisible considering the conditions we were in.  During this entire incident, I do not recall any annunciated checklists that were priority in nature.  That left me to search in the unannunciated section.  I feel strongly that some sort of 'Priority' section to the unannunciated checklists would have been helpful.  One section that has just the high importance items would be nice.  Things like Severe Damage, Decompression, and Smoke.  Otherwise, we are left to search through numerous pages to find these important lists.  And even once on the correct page, the lists in question are buried on that page.  Not very easy to locate in the challenging situation we were presented with.				B777 flight crew reports an engine failure during climb that results in dense smoke in the cockpit and the inability to locate the QRH.  The Left Engine Fuel Control switch is confirmed and placed to off using system knowledge.  Some difficulties using the B777 ECL are also reported.  The smoke begins to clear and a single engine overweight landing ensues.  Procedures at this air carrier apparently do not include any immediate action items, the QRC is to be referenced in all cases.

The fumes were not present in any other section of the cabin. He stated the fumes had been present for a while and were not diminishing. I contacted Maintenance via phone and asked for any input they could offer. The Maintenance Controller suggested to shut off the IFE (in flight entertainment) using the emergency shutoff switch. This was performed by the cabin crew. After approximately 10 minutes, I phoned the Purser and was told the fumes had not dissipated and were now moving aft of the original location. Other sources of possible fumes by operating electronic devices were investigated but could not be located. During this time, we were in contact with Dispatch via ACARS. We were advised of the weather along our route of flight at possible diversion airports. Based on this information, the First Officer and I completed the Smoke/Fumes/Avionics Smoke checklist which advised us to LAND ASAP. Dispatch was contacted and the decision was made to divert. The flight attendants were advised and the cabin was prepared for landing. An emergency was declared and we began an immediate descent. We landed and stopped on the runway. The Fire Department inspected the airplane from the outside using infrared cameras and did not find anything wrong. We then taxied to the gate and were met by ground service personnel.During the descent into the divert airport, a guest had become boisterous and began to say things that caused concern and began to frighten our other guests. It was reported to me by our flight attendants and other guests that the guest in question made verbal comments referring to terrorists and that he believed we were all going to die as a result of the issues with the aircraft that caused us to make a diversion.

The First Officer checked manuals to look for guidance while I contacted the Dispatcher via ACARS. The First Officer found no guidance in the manuals. The Dispatcher and I considered the weather at our destination, deleted our alternate, and determined the fuel burn to destination at 10,000 FT MSL.

We initially received and followed a descent clearance to FL240, whereupon ATC would not issue a further descent because of an underlying Warning Area. Captain declared an emergency at that time, and requested further descent to below 10,000 MSL. ATC issued a clearance to 12,000, and our aircraft rapidly descended to 12,000. We were handed over to [the divert airport] approach control and continued an uneventful diversion where maintenance resolved the pressurization irregularity. We remained in positive ATC control through out flight. Aircraft's cabin never exceeded 9000 feet in spite of loss of pressurization system at FL280+.				A B737-800's pressurization system failed climbing through FL287 so an emergency was declared and the flight diverted to a nearby airport where repairs were made.

It is very common for the Release to issue BURRO2 and voice clearance to issue WILDCAT2 Departure.  Thus, when we received the non-standard routing to LAX, I carefully manually entered routing, including J-104. (I did not enter a standard route and then modify it at any time.)  But, clearance past TNP was BASET3, which indicated LAX was landing east.  I clarified clearance with Delivery via voice, and wrote the clearance on my copy of Release.  This peculiarity was mentioned to the Captain during the clearance briefing.  All briefings were accomplished in accordance with FOM standards.  Route was confirmed, and both agreed since weather package showed LAX landing west, we'd expect a new routing to SEAVU or other west arrival.  However, BASET3 remained as route clearance arrival.Once airborne ABQ Center questioned our route at 20 NM west of GBN at FL 360.  FMC showed GBN to TNP, and then BASET 3.  ABQ directed us to MESSI intersection along J104, thus MESSI DCT TNP.  No other comment from ABQ Center.  Unsure how/why FMC dropped J104 from NAV routing.  I personally loaded non-standard route and loaded J104, knowing inconsistencies were normal from our origination city.  Both Pilots discussed and reviewed departure routing and clearance. Yet, Dispatch Clearance was antiquated and failed to match current conditions at LAX.		I looked at the routing and continued with my preflight. During the briefing, I confirmed the waypoints on the BURRO2 Departure out to GBN.  About the time we reached GBN, I called up the LAX ATIS to confirm the landing direction.  Center called us not long after passing GBN and told us it looked like we were headed direct to TNP when the clearance was GBN J104 TNP.  I pulled up the Routing page and saw that it was indeed direct to TNP.  Center cleared us to MESSI intersection and we changed the routing to MESSI J104 TNP.  I thought that I had checked the routing and everything was correct.  I don't know for certain if it was input incorrectly or if possibly changing the arrival STAR had affected the route.  Attention to detail and briefings are always vital and I thought we had but this one may have slipped through.		B737-700 Flight Crew experienced a track deviation during a flight from TUS to LAX.  The J104 airway between GBN and TNP had dropped out.

As I investigated the noise I discovered that my headset cord was caught in the upper left corner of the window (I had opened the window at the gate to speak to the Ramper, because he was having trouble getting a headset to work). The noise was getting louder the higher we climbed, so at about 9,000 FT, I asked ATC if we could level off for a few minutes to sort out the problem. Consulted the QRH and decided I would attempt to open the window enough to clear the headset cord. I asked to descend to 5,000 FT. We ran the pressurization manually to 5,000 FT cabin altitude and slowed to maneuvering speed. I opened the window enough to clear the cord, closed the window, returned the pressurization system to auto and continued on to destination.				A B737-800 Captain's clear view window had a headset cord stuck in it prior to takeoff so that a very loud air leak developed in flight, which the Captain remedied by opening his window at 5,000 FT.

There was loss of all items associated with loss of GREEN Hydraulics, including Nosewheel Steering, Normal Brakes, #1 Thrust Reverser, etc. I ran QRH and ECAM checklists. We declared EMERGENCY with Departure Control, and received vectors for landing Runway 18 ILS Approach. I notified flight attendants, Operations, and briefed the passengers before landing. I told Tower we would need [to be]towed off Runway 18 due to loss of nosewheel steering. We flew a normal ILS approach, landing, and rollout. Fire trucks were awaiting our landing. We came to full stop on runway centerline, started the APU, and shutdown engines after the 3 minute cooling period. A Tug towed us to the gate.

The heading and altitude were set in the FCU and verified on the FMA by the Captain and First Officer. This heading closely paralleled the SID. Later, during the climb, it was noted that the air conditioning system was sending below freezing air to the cabin. As the Captain worked the problem, and the new First Officer helped and accomplished his other duties, the aircraft somehow reverted to the navigation mode. This resulted in a turn to the right. The crew and ATC noticed the turn at about 010 degrees and an immediate correction was made. This aircraft was dispatched with two MEL's on the air conditioning system. Somehow the combination made temperature control problematic and the distraction contributed to the delayed recognition of the turn. While I am still not sure why the aircraft reverted to the NAV mode, it should have been recognized sooner. I needed to remember the cardinal rule of one pilot flying the aircraft exclusively and the other working the problem. Secondarily, the compound MEL's led to a distraction during a busy phase of flight. This contributed to the delayed recognition. These MEL's had existed for three and seven days each and the aircraft had transited Maintenance stations multiple times. Although legal, MEL's that could cause distractions should be repaired in a timelier manner.				An A330 crew was distracted while dealing with an air conditioning system malfunction. There was a track deviation after the FMGC reverted from a heading mode to the NAV mode.

As the Captain, I reviewed everything like a normal day, but once I got to the weather packet after reviewing NOTAM's and weather, I looked at the information page, usually the front page, and then it was time to go.  Everything proceeded normally throughout takeoff when the First Officer (Flying Pilot) and I had a different opinion on how to fly the departure.  We clarified with Departure Control around 500 feet while on the original heading given.  We were given radar vectors and then directed further down than what we filed.  The flight proceeded normally.  Once at cruise, I went back and reviewed the PDC and weather packet.  After reviewing the weather packet more carefully, I noticed there was a second page with information regarding departures out of Boston.  When you first look at the packet, the first page finishes with initials and I believed the flight information was complete at that point.  Upon reading through the second page, I saw we had a departure that was not recommended due to discontinuities.  We did not fly the SID.  We flew radar vectors.  The flight proceeded normally and landed 20 minutes early.  I failed to notice there was more information and will make sure in the future I do not repeat that.				B737-700 Captain fails to notice a NOTAM for BOS stating that all RNAV departures are suspended and can be assigned by ATC only.  The ATC clearance is via an RNAV departure and ATC issues a Radar vector when queried by the Captain shortly after takeoff.

Immediately after landing, aircraft did pitch up a little, but did not seem at all unusual. There was no unusual sensation or noise during landing touchdown or rollout. However, shortly after touch-down, there was a very quick amber ECAM indication that I noticed out of my peripheral vision. During my scan, I was looking at airspeed at time of amber indication and was unable to identify since it was only illuminated about two seconds. Captain did not see the actual indication readout either, only seeing the amber light. Captain chose to look aircraft over after arriving at the gate. He stated that there had been a slight amount of damage to tail section, underneath APU, due to what he thought might have been a tail strike. Captain said he entered the occurrence in aircraft logbook.In retrospect, it appears that Captain touched down within pitch limitation, but may have pulled back on side stick at touchdown, causing a slight grazing of tail section against runway surface. This is a difficult one, because it is very difficult at times to know where the pitch is in relationship to the limitation without staring at the attitude indicator continuously. The pitch was well below the 10 degree limitation at touchdown, but evidently it changed just enough to cause a problem just after landing. I felt equally responsible for not seeing the amber indication reading, so I could report this to the Captain. I had just made the 'speed brake' callout and had shifted focus on the airspeed, anticipating the high speed turnoff ahead, when the amber light flashed on and then off. In the future, I will put more of an emphasis on monitoring pitch, not only during landing, but also just after touchdown. My scan is going to be more intense at this critical time during the flight. I also will be determined to improve my scan overall, as monitoring pilot, making sure not to fixate, but take in the entire picture before me.		During the landing, the flare may have been slightly early resulting in a slight rise after touchdown (slight bounce). While correcting for second touchdown I heard a ding (possible ECAM) with no ECAM displayed. Touchdown was smooth. During post flight inspection, discovered APU drain mast was scraped. I called Maintenance Control and made a log book entry.It is possible the ding we heard was an ECAM. [The] pitch resulted in a possible APU drain mast scrape. Winds were reported calm. However, during the approach we had a slight tail wind. In addition, the aircraft felt heavy on takeoff, climb, and approach; sluggish or slow to respond. [The aircraft was] possibly overweight. With a bounced aircraft, I normally hold attitude while [it] settles in order to prevent exceeding pitch attitude. It is a balance of attitude/airspeed to prevent floating down the runway. Airspeed bleeds off and second touch down occurs usually close to Vls. I suspect an overweight aircraft due to the close proximity of second touchdown with aircraft pitching nose up (stall) so rapidly resulting in a possible APU drain mast being dragged on the runway.One technique a First Officer showed me was to pull up the aircraft calculated weight in the FMGC (via FAC). He said he was told to accomplish this by a Check Airman as a matter of technique. The FAC uses data from elevator/thrust/airspeed and will give a weight display according to data obtained. That weight is highly accurate and often times we are about 5,000 LBS heavier than weight and balance data. As a matter of technique, if 5,000 LBS overweight add 5 KTS to the Vls as protection against a stalled landing. I have started to use his technique. However, on this flight due to the short duration I neglected to check the FAC produced weight data.

We were told to climb, then traffic showed at our altitude and we were told to descend. By then we were climbing. Then traffic jumped to 6 miles away and TCAS said clear of traffic. During go around traffic showed in our position again then jumped away. Tower reported helicopter traffic at first and then said it was clear. The TCAS was showing false traffic through out our go around. The traffic was always within 200 FT or at our altitude and then would jump away. We went around and made an uneventful approach and landing and wrote up the TCAS. I chose to go around because I did not know if there was traffic or not. I did not want to ignore the TCAS and could not get away from the traffic.				An A330 TCAS issued RA warnings inside the outer marker so a go around was executed and the crew determined the warnings were false.

We did the ECAM actions. We continued to slowly lose fluid. On the initial approach phase we slowed, turned the pumps back on, and lowered the landing gear without incident and then turned the pumps back off. I turned the pumps back on since we still had fluid in the system and I wanted the gear doors shut so we would have nose wheel steering to clear the runway, if possible. We got additional ECAMs during the approach as the last of the fluid was lost, so I declared an emergency and informed Tower that we would likely not be able to clear the runway due to loss of nose wheel steering. After an uneventful landing we were able to clear the runway using green [system] hydraulic accumulator pressure, but soon exhausted that and needed to be towed the remaining distance to the gate.Mechanics said it looked like a leak in the area of engine 1 green engine driven pump. The previous crew had written up a similar fault on this aircraft on the previous leg, which occurred during their approach/landing. [I suggest] more thorough troubleshooting by Maintenance.

The inflight crew used the available oxygen to allow the pax to breathe easier. Near the change over point, the flight attendants reported all of the oxygen bottles on board had been used down to 1,500 PSI. Shortly after, we were informed that the one of the bottles required by the FOM to be above 1,500 PSI, had been used down to 250 PSI. In accordance with the FOM, we descended with ATC's permission to FL250. We did this after determining there would be sufficient fuel to reach the destination. We actually landed with more fuel than calculated, possibly due to flying at ECON cruise speeds. No emergency was declared and no further incidents were noticed. The flight landed uneventfully.				A passenger required oxygen on an oceanic flight and because all cabin walk around bottles were used to 1,500 PSI or less the aircraft was descended to FL250.

Failed to identify the programming error until ATC pointed out that we looked high, issuing a Traffic Alert. I have been on an A.M. line this month and last. The day began with a late show time and was not scheduled to end until well after dark. Due to the late aircraft arrival, another lengthy delay for late connecting bags, a complicated mechanical issue, an associated maintenance delay and unscheduled swap, the already busy six-leg day became much more involved. Due to the short nature of all the legs and rapid tempo, climbing straight into descent, we both were quite worn out by the end of the day. Lobby time was in the morning. The prior day, lobby time was four hours earlier. We have A.M. and P.M. trips for a reason, so pilots aren't bouncing between sleep cycles during the pairing. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we were scheduled to do. Keep pairings within the typical A.M. and P.M. footprint. If the day is stretched, don't schedule a six-leg day.		Programmed the crossing restriction as ten north of FWA, when it should have been ten south (FWA10 versus FWA-10). Failed to catch the error until ATC pointed it out, issuing a Traffic Alert.Fatigue is a huge factor in this incident. We have been up since early A.M. and have flown six legs. Plus, ran late due to late bags, mechanical issues, and unscheduled plane swaps. The Company scheduling one crew to fly a full day on the weekend is absolutely asinine. Originating an aircraft in the morning and terminating after dark exposes the passengers, crew, aircraft, and ultimately the Company to a huge safety risk from this kind of error.We lobbied this morning early.  We are still at the airport over 14 hours later typing this. We won't get to the hotel until late. I still have to eat and get ready for bed, let alone unwind enough to actually sleep. We lobby at an hour earlier in the morning (tomorrow). If we are lucky and the hotel is quiet, we'll get seven hours of sleep, followed by another eight-hour duty day with a couple of hours sitting. Absolutely and incredibly unsafe, yet we continue to see more and more of this.		B737-700 flight crew reports programing the FMC for ten north of the fix instead of ten south as required, resulting in a missed crossing restriction. Fatigue was cited as a factor in the incident.

We had the FMC correctly programmed and the Captain was flying/monitoring the aircraft/FMC while I was off getting ATIS.  The autopilot in LNAV/VNAV started a slow descent after TURLO but I guess it was not fast enough for OAK ATC.  They did not say anything to us (Flight Crew) but they reported to the System Chief that we were seven miles past TURLO before we descended and complained.  That's automation for you.  Get used to it.  If you don't like it, change the automation.		ATC reported our flight because the radar track showed us at FL240 7.5 miles past TURLO on the WRAPS 5 Arrival. Note: I do not recall a 'cross TURLO at FL240, then descend to...' clearance. We were given TURLO at FL240. I remember that we were given best forward speed as we were number one, and I remember the descent profile from FL 240 to 10,000' as being very unusual. I reviewed the arrival and briefed the First Officer prior to beginning the arrival that we needed to cross TURLO at FL240, and then descend right away if there was a descent after TURLO. I briefed from memory the need to descend after TURLO, as stressed in a past company bulletin. I don't know if there was a deviation or if ATC just held us at FL 240. What I do know is that this has been a problem for ATC and our pilots for a long time. I am exceptionally thorough in my briefings. If we erred on this arrival after a thorough briefing I am very disappointed, both personally and professionally. Yet, the error would have happened even after briefing the 10-7 page, the arrival, and known descent issues. ATC should quit depending on a voice issued clearance for a critical descent point in their system. Rewrite the WRAPS5 Arrival to allow today's modern aircraft to enter a proper descent profile to and after the TURLO intersection using a hard altitude after TURLO to satisfy whatever your requirements are.  There is no reason to be using a controlling voice over an issue so critical and so often not properly complied with. Issuing violations for a known ATC issue is not the way to fix this. All Pilots now fly the WRAPS Arrival with FMC automation.  Our company is using RNAV procedures that maximize fuel efficiency by not descending until the Top of Descent as figured by the FMC. This will only become more frequent as the rest of the aviation world is going to RNAV and as fuel prices continue to rise. So give us a tool in the form of an arrival that requires a programmed descent meeting Oakland Center needs. Anything less will continue to result in deviations and someday possibly a safety or separation issue, and ATC will be cited for allowing a known and continuing issue to go unresolved for years. I can find numerous TURLO descent reports in the Company system and that would also indicate that there must be many more from other carriers and private aircraft in the system. It is time for a permanent fix.		A B737NG Flight Crew failed to comply with an ATC descent clearance while flying the WRAPS STAR to SMF.

While in VNAV, the pilot flying ensured the TURLO Waypoint had an altitude constraint of FL240 and then set in FL200 in the MCP [ALT ALERT window]. Upon arrival at TURLO at FL240, I noticed the pilot flying was not continuing the descent to FL200. I repeated the clearance to continue the descent to FL200 at which time the pilot flying did just that. I do not know exactly how much time/distance passed after passing TURLO and starting the descent.Pilots must understand ahead of time that VNAV will not continue a descent after reaching an altitude constraint until it hits its next calculated descent point. If you must descend earlier, it must be done manually.				A B737NG flight crew failed to comply with an ATC descent clearance while flying the WRAPS STAR to SMF.

We suspected wake turbulence from a passing aircraft above. It was a surprise to both crew members as the passing aircraft was shown on TCAS as 5,000 FT above our cruising altitude. The fasten seatbelt sign was OFF and no notification of crossing traffic was given by ATC. The aircraft did not suffer any loss of altitude or upset attitude, and at no time was any strain felt against my lap belt. The ride was smooth and there were no adverse ride reports. Approximately 1 hour later the Lead Flight Attendant notified the cockpit that a passenger claimed to have suffered a broken toe. Later, I was learned that the passenger was resting his foot on part of either the sidewall or aft end of the armrest from the seat in front of him. Upon sensing the quick jolts of the aircraft, he quickly withdrew his foot striking the structure. The Lead Flight Attendant reported to me that the passenger mentioned it might have been his (the passenger's) fault for the injury. The passenger claimed he injured his right foot, first toe, and the top of his right foot. The passenger was given an aspirin. A volunteer medical professional was summoned and a doctor responded. The doctor advised that all that could be done was to elevate the foot, apply ice as necessary and administer ibuprofen. After consultation with Dispatch and [medical personnel], it was determine safe to continue. Paramedics were summoned to the aircraft and subsequently met the passenger.				An A320 Captain reported encountering wake vortex that resulted in moderate chop. A passenger complained of a broken toe as a result of the event.

The takeoff was discontinued [and] the aircraft probably had not reached 30 KTS maximum. We advised ATC of the discontinued takeoff and he told us to take the reverse high speed taxiway although he may have said something else, but neither pilot recalls the exact transmission due to our attention being focused on our aircraft. Instead of the turn directed we turned at the taxiway which was the closest and most available for us to clear the runway. As we began the turn ATC sent a commuter jet on approach to another runway around due to the potential for us to taxi underneath the approach path to that runway. At no time was our aircraft in conflict with another aircraft either airborne or on the ground. The Controller professionally resolved the issue well before any conflict developed.				Following a low speed rejected takeoff due to asymmetrical spooling of the engines, the flight crew of a B737-800 exited the runway at an exit other than that by which they were cleared, presenting the possibility of conflict with an inbound jet to an adjacent runway. The Tower directed the landing aircraft to execute a precautionary go-around.

The heading pointed us directly toward a cumulus build-up approximately 10 to 15 NM ahead with dense virga coming out of the bottom that nearly reached the ground. We began to experience moderate chop and I immediately requested a 15 degree right turn to avoid the weather. Departure told me unable right turn, so I requested a 20 degree left turn and again Departure told me unable because we were not in his airspace. I then informed him that we were going to make a turn left or right, his choice, but that we had to turn for the weather. We showed nothing on the TCAS on either side. The Controller got very huffy and demanded a PIREP and then gave us the right turn we originally asked for. This unnecessarily long conversation with Departure drove us [very] close to the weather. The deviation required us to track approximately 5 to 10 NM right of course and 15 to 20 NM down range before we could return to the original flightplan. I requested the initial deviation for a reason and I was clear about that reason. It is completely unsatisfactory and distracting for the Controller to second guess or be indignant about my stated requirement to maneuver in order to ensure the safety of my passengers, crew, and ship.				Air carrier departure from DEN expressed concern regarding ATC handling during requested deviations because of weather, characterizing the Controller's performance as 'completely unsatisfactory.'

After our return, Maintenance replaced a sensor, followed by a five minute run-up test at 80% N1. When the light returned during the subsequent takeoff roll I was concerned that it could be caused by a more serious threat of uncontained HOT, HIGH pressure bleed air and would be safer handled on the ground. I aborted the takeoff when the light illuminated 20 KTS below V1. Total runway used from the start of the roll to RTO stop: 4,500 FT. Runway remaining after RTO: 7,500 FT.

I transitioned inside to crosscheck airspeed and noted it at approximately 48 KTS. By the time I was able to make a decision to abort or not; we had accelerated to a point that I felt was too fast to abort safely. I chose to take the aircraft airborne. At approximately 200 FT, I transferred control of the aircraft to the FO, assuming that he had the reliable airspeed indicator. Climbing to 3,000 FT, we crosschecked other airspeed indicators to try and determine the most reliable source. We did have IAS disagreement lights, but they extinguished at level off at 3,000 FT. All indications appeared to align with one another and I took back control of the aircraft. Starting to climb out of 3,000 FT, the auto-throttles disengaged and we once again began to receive erroneous airspeed indications. I passed the controls to the FO and we began a pitch/power controlled climb. My airspeed continued to climb as the aircraft climbed. A crosscheck with the HGS and standby airspeed indicator did not yet reveal that my indications were erroneous. Passing through 7,500 FT, we got the airspeed overspeed clacker and lowered the nose and added power to ensure safe flight. At that point, we were able to define, for the most part, that my instruments were at fault. We confirmed with Departure that what they showed aligned with the FO's instruments. We climbed and leveled at 10,000 FT. My instruments showed 417 KTS and the FO's indicated about 250 KTS. We got the weather from Approach and proceeded direct to ZZZ. En route, we decided to declare an emergency because we were down to one valid airspeed indicator. We broke out between layers at 10,000 FT and continued in VFR conditions the remainder of the flight. As we descended, my airspeed indicator started to decrease. Around 7,000 FT the airspeed clacker stopped. We planned a flaps 30 landing. As we configured the aircraft, we realized that the aircraft would not allow flaps 30 because of my airspeed indications. The airspeed slowed far enough on the final segment to allow the flaps 30 to deploy. The landing and taxi to the gate was uneventful.				A B737-700 flight crew reported erroneous airspeed indications on the Captain's side, apparently from a pitot/static system problem. They declared an emergency and a normal landing ensued.

Heading was whatever heading was to track course from BSR to MENLO. Was also pointed out traffic to maintain visual with. Traffic was slightly ahead of us, converging from the east for Runway 28R. Runway 28L ILS OTS, extended centerline from final approach fix, L NAV and V NAV were both engaged. Also LOC/VOR was engaged. I engaged LOC from past experience in 767 that if both were engaged it would capture whatever came within parameters first. Also since Runway 28L was OTS and no signal, I wasn't concerned. Though I think now this is a bad habit for 737. No one during initial training, nor am I aware of anywhere in manuals, is [the] interaction of VOR/LOC and L NAV when both engaged discussed . Anyway, as we approached the magenta line of extended centerline, the plane began to turn towards anticipated final course, so much so that I slewed heading bug to final course. Then I focused on the traffic as we were on converging course and he appeared to be getting closer. Then the Captain said 'hey it's not working, we aren't tracking'. I looked towards the airport and saw we were clearly through the 28L final. Now I knew why traffic appeared to be getting closer! We were still on converging course. No TA or RA was ever issued, but as we were converging and I now realized we were past final course where we didn't belong, I had great concern for the traffic and clicked off autopilot and visually rapidly rolled the plane back towards Runway 28L final without regard to inside instruments. 'bank angle bank angle' was annunciated. Again my primary concern at that point was to get traffic separation. I estimate bank was no more then 40. At 'bank angle' I shallowed bank and no more annunciations and landed uneventfully with no one on radio saying anything nor any remarks from passengers or Flight Attendant's.		On final I noted that LNAV and VNAV were still active and VOR/LOC was still armed. At the gate we had a brief discussion as to why the autopilot did not intercept the LNAV final. We both agreed that it must have had something to do with VOR/LOC being armed with the ILS being OTS although neither of us was completely sure being relatively new to the airplane. We had both done that approach to SFO many times (with the ILS working), so out of habit we had both set our Nav radios to the ILS Runway 28L even after briefing the ILS OTS. In retrospect (and after a good night's sleep), it seems obvious that we should not have set those frequencies and it should have raised a red flag to me when the PF armed VOR/LOC after briefing LNAV/VNAV.		A B737-800 flight crew reported confusion on how to properly set up the autoflight system for a visual approach (ILS out of service) to SFO at night.

About 1:45 into the flight we got  BRAKES  A/Skid NWS FAULT ECAM  with Cat 3 Dual, A/Skid, N/W steering, BSCU 1 and BSCU 2 INOP on the status page.  Having departed with BSCU #2 INOP and the status page now showing BSCU #1 INOP also, I tried the FM BSCU reset with no effect.  Established a phone patch with Maintenance Control and Dispatch.  Maintenance Control had no further suggestions and it was determined we would be landing with alternate brakes, no antiskid or nose wheel steering.  A tow in from the runway would be required.  Given better facilities in ZZZ then ZZZ2 I suggested diverting to ZZZ, Maintenance Control and Dispatch agreed.   (ZZZ wx was good with light north winds) We discussed communications, Dispatch would advise ZZZ ops and Tower or our situation, we would arrange the destination change with ATC.  We were about 250 miles from ZZZ. The First Officer and I discussed landing and, due to the lack of steering and possibility of tire damage decided a cabin prep would be prudent.  I had the Purser come to the cockpit and we briefed all items for the for the prep with about 30 minutes to go.  She went back to brief her crew and after a few minutes I made a PA telling the passengers what was going on and what was going to happen.  We proceeded  toward ZZZ and reviewed landing distance requirements, FM procedures and system descriptions.  About 20 or 25 minutes later the purser called back advising that they were ready in back. As we approached ZZZ we verified that ATC knew we would be an emergency for the landing and that equipment was in place.  It was.  ZZZ had several wind changes and we discussed which runway would be best for minimum cross wind and no tailwind.  We ended up using XXR with SW winds at about 12 knots. Landing was uneventful and we were able to stay on the centerline and stop without incident.  Airport OPS personnel and emergency equipment checked our main gear and found no abnormalities.  Maintenance towed us to the gate.				A320 Captain reports being dispatched with BSCU #2 deferred.  Enroute BSCU #1 fails which results in the loss of normal brakes and nose wheel steering.  The crew elects to diverts to an airport with a longer runway and lands safely.

The First Officer (pilot flying) selected [armed] the Apch Mode on the MCP [Mode Control Panel] as we were approaching a fairly large rain shaft on final. Suddenly the glideslope indicator came off the upper peg and swept very rapidly downward and the FMS grabbed it and the airplane pitched over violently as the glideslope indicator went full scale from top to bottom. By the time the autopilot was disconnected the pitch change was such that the airplane lost almost 400 FT and was recovered by about 4,600 FT. Almost immediately another aircraft behind us reported the same thing happening to them. The First Officer recovered quickly and climbed back to 5,000 FT. I don't know if the glideslope signal was faulty or if there was interference from another aircraft on the approach or the thunderstorm on final. Regardless, the First Officer did a nice job recovering and getting back on the approach and landed in a very strong wind with no further incident.	The reporter added that after the following aircraft reported the same 'false glide slope' capture the Tower stated words to the effect of: '...the heavy's out of the way now,' seeming to imply a predictable interference with the glide slope signal from an aircraft on the ground in the vicinity of the GS transmitter.  The reporter also re-emphasized the abruptness of the pitch over and felt it was severe enough to have caused a safety issue had any passenger or crew member not yet have been in their seat with their seat belt fastened.			A B737-800, cleared for the ILS approach from 5,000 MSL to Runway 28R at ORD, suffered a severe pitch over and loss of altitude when the autopilot captured an apparently false GS as it descended rapidly from the top to the bottom of the 'cage.' After recovering from the event, the aircraft following them on the approach reported an apparently identical anomaly. Following the second event the Local Controller stated words to the effect of '...the heavy's out of the way now'.

While at ZZZ, I contacted Maintenance Control for assistance to MEL this issue because, due to insufficient ground time, aircraft would need a two day stay to be able to comply with special FAR-88 (SFAR-88) and troubleshooting manual (TSM) 28-21-00-810. Maintenance Control in ZZZ1 has been notified [and], as per cautionary, C/B  has been collared. This is being deferred per MEL-28-40-15A [and] entered in the back of logbook, so I was given this MEL by Maintenance Control. I thought it was the right MEL that applied to this issue; ETOPS was cleared, aircraft left ZZZ to ZZZZ; it arrived there with no problem. But, leaving ZZZZ, I was [later] informed that it had a return to block with the wrong MEL on it. So the MEL was changed to [MEL] 28-21-01, which makes it non-extended range beyond 120 minutes. So here, what confuses me [is] how the wrong MEL was applied here in ZZZ when the outbound crew had no problems, [but] the crew in ZZZZ didn't catch this on their preflight and the Maintenance Controller [had] already reviewed the ETOPS and he didn't say anything about it either. The other problem I have here is why in no place in the MEL states to collar the tripped C/B.	Reporter stated he has thirty-five years as a Mechanic with two different airlines. Seems like there is a Catch-22 where the FAA requires compliance with SFAR-88 that also requires Maintenance Procedures be performed for deferral of a popped wing fuel pump circuit breaker (C/B) under MEL 28-21-01 by collaring the C/B and disconnecting the fuel pump canon plug. But, a deferral is allowed under MEL 28-40-15 for the same popped fuel boost pump C/B and 'No' maintenance procedure is required to collar the pump C/B or disconnect the fuel pump canon plug. Why should an ETOPS flight require compliance with SFAR-88 for fuel pump deferrals, but a non-ETOPS flight does not have the same requirement for a popped fuel pump circuit breaker?Reporter stated he installed a collar under the #2 wing fuel boost pump C/B as a precaution, even though the first MEL 28-40-15 they used, that ended up being incorrect, did not require a C/B collar.			A Line Mechanic reports he noticed an MEL deferral maintenance procedure discrepancy for their A330 aircraft where MEL 28-21-00 requires a popped wing fuel boost pump circuit breaker to be collared prior to ETOPS dispatch, to comply with SFAR-88 and troubleshooting manual (TSM) 28-21-00. However, MEL 28-40-15 does not require the same popped C/B to be collared for a non-ETOPS flight.

During cruise we noticed that crew O2 pressure was decreasing at what appeared to be faster than cold-soaking would account for. We contacted dispatch. During radio contact with dispatch and Flight Duty Officer the rate of O2 pressure decrease seemed to accelerate. I immediately decided to begin descent at that point in time. After coordination with the above parties and considering ferry fuel we fortunately had on board, we determined that the safe course of action would be to continue to descend so as to arrive at 10,000 feet altitude with much greater than Flight Manual required oxygen quantity and continue to destination at 10,000 feet while closely monitoring fuel reserves and available alternate airports. This we did and we landed at destination with approximately 9,000 lbs or 1.5 hrs of fuel on board on a VMC day with no alternate required. We blocked in with greater than FM required O2 quantity.

Myself and Mechanic Y were working together; he did the left side half I did the right side. I installed the loop on the engine with several Adel-[type] mount clamps, loosely, to leave movement for adjustment.  I made the connections on the forward end of the loop with difficulty due to limited access and small hardware.  While installing the rest of the loop frame mount clamps, one clamp proved to be very troublesome; I moved to the aft terminal connections while my partner worked on the problem clamp. I installed the rest of the mount clamps and checked the terminal connections. Then we closed the cowling, did the Fire/Overheat Test which passed, and ran the engine for five minutes with still no faults or messages.  I can see how I had not correctly tightened the small terminals screws in fear of snapping them off. And also missed loop frame mounts due to frustrations with various areas of the installation. The [Maintenance] Manual (M/M) did not list [direct Mechanic] to remove the bug or the starter; if they were removed it would have made the procedure easier.

The panel number was 534AB. The Captain wrote the panel number down and went back to the cockpit. When airborne, the Captain thought through the reason for the drainage holes and their position and came to the conclusion that the drainage holes should be on the low side of the wing versus the high side and submitted the writeup via ACARS.  Although this is not a required preflight item, the Captain decided to write the issue up rather than remain silent and the Captain explained to the First Officer what the Captain saw and why the Captain wrote it up. The flight conditions were CAVU with no known icing conditions and were forecast as such throughout the flight. Between flights, the Captain received a phone message from Flight Operations, and was told that Mechanic X was writing me [the Captain] up and filing a report. The Captain attempted to get in touch with Mechanic X through local Maintenance, through local Maintenance frequencies, phone numbers and even tried to find someone in an office near the gate, but was not able to. Once the Captain reached the cockpit for the next flight, the First Officer said that after the Captain left the cockpit, a person entered the cockpit in non-maintenance attire and spoke with her about the writeup. Then the First Officer, of all things, told the Captain that she found the very same issue on her preflight for this aircraft. The Captain went outside and visually checked both wings with the First Officer and confirmed that the left wing vent panel seemed to have been installed backwards. We both decided to contact Maintenance before writing it up because now we weren't sure if this was systemic or just a non-issue.  Moreover, we thought it best to get a Mechanic's opinion before proceeding. Back in the cockpit, the Captain contacted Maintenance Control and explained the issue to them and that we wanted someone from Maintenance to come out to the aircraft and look at the vent panels and make a determination before we wrote the mismatch up. A Mechanic entered the cockpit and we explained the issue and the First Officer accompanied the Mechanic outside and showed the Mechanic the discrepancy. The First Officer returned to the cockpit and informed the Captain that the Mechanic advised us to write it up and that they would research it and either fix it or defer it. The Captain submitted the Maintenance Code in ACARS. After a few minutes the Gate Agent asked if we were ready and that she was informed by Operations that everything was good to go. The Captain elected to visually inspect the panel.  The panel had been repositioned and we received a new maintenance release. The flight departed from the gate two minutes late because we had yet to perform the Before Start Checklist. The new maintenance release ACTION for the log item stated 'Panel 534AB was installed backwards removed panel and reinstalled in correct position'. Further notes: on the ground, the Captain was fully aware that the flight would be flying into no known icing conditions and was aware that the forecast for the route of flight was clear.  The Captain wrote the discrepancy up while airborne after taking some time to think about the issue, and fully aware that it was a pre-flight discrepancy; the Captain believes that after the issue was thought through it would be best to submit a Maintenance Report enroute versus after block-in.  The Captain did not write this up to increase the workload of company Maintenance. The Captain did not write this up because of Union-Management contract issues.  The Captain's intent for the write-up, once the low side/high side vent hole discrepancy was thought through, was solely for safety. Additionally, upon airborne reflection regarding the discrepancy and the subsequent decision to input the write-up, the Captain felt that it was the right thing to do.  The Captain confirmed this feeling when the subsequent aircraft had the exact same discrepancy and the panel was shown to be installed backwards. The Captain can attest that all of the above facts are stated truthfully and accurately.		I was Pilot Flying on this flight.  My Captain performed the preflight walk around for our flight as he normally does for his First Officer when his First Officer is the pilot flying.  Upon completion of his walkaround he made no comments on his inspection and we completed our checklists and made an uneventful departure from the airport. During cruise phase I began preparing my approach plates and runway diagrams for our arrival, and my Captain began requesting the next leg paperwork through the ACARS.  When I was finished with my preparations I noticed my Captain finishing entering a maintenance write-up into the ACARS.  He entered a [numerical] designation and sent it.  I queried him about what he had written up.  He said there was a small panel under each wing tip that had drain holes for drainage of moisture should any enter the panel during deicing. One of our panels was installed backwards. Each wing tip had an identical symmetrical panel and the panel should be installed with the drain holes on the lower edge of the opening due to wing dihedral.  I mentioned that I was unaware of the particular panel other than it is one of many panels that are visible during walk around and should be secure with all fasteners installed and no leaking fluids.  And that to my knowledge I have never been instructed on the possibility of this panel's drain holes being positioned improperly.  He said he became aware of this situation during a pilot class or pilot training at the training center and it isn't one of those things that are put in the Flight Manual. I was notified after the flight by my Captain that Maintenance is issuing a report due to our entering the write-up inflight rather than prior to the flight.		A Captain and First Officer describe why a left outboard wing vent panel #534AB on their A320 aircraft had been installed backwards.  It was written-up up in-flight, instead of prior to departure when Captain noticed the discrepancy during a pre-flight walkaround.

There were no pilots available to help, so a Flight Attendant was the only option. All went ok and the Captain was able to taxi the aircraft to gate after I made the landing. I don't know the illness he was suffering from at this time.	The reporter stated that the Captain went to a medical facility at the airport and it was determined that he had food poisoning from something that he ate before flight.

I changed the intersection altitude on the LEGS page to 240B and the Cruise page to FL200. The First Officer verified and I initiated. I got distracted with other functions and did not notice that the VNAV light went out and the aircraft reverted to speed function and shallowed the descent to 1,000 FPM. By the time we caught it and the Controller alerted us, it was too late. The First Officer and I tried to figure out why it would go out of VNAV but [could not].

Flight planned for 35,000 FT and .79 mach. Captain requests 39,000 FT and flies economy of .77 mach. At cruise arrival fuel shows 5.4. We received direct routing and executed an optimal descent.35 minutes before arrival the airport was turned around, landing west now instead of east. Approach assigned a speed of 310 KTS. Abeam field, we have fuel of 6.2 and are given a visual approach, assigned 210 KTS, and asked to follow an Airbus. Next we were asked to slow to 170 KTS. We saw that spacing was looking tight and start slowing. Tower advised us to slow to approach speed and approved S-turns if necessary. Captain elected to execute shallow S-turns while following glide path. Tower called go-around due to the Airbus delay in exiting the runway.Captain executed go-around and we were vectored for short approach, but given a longer final than expected. At shut down, fuel read 3.6; way too low for my comfort. [I] would like Dispatch to be aware of this and load more appropriately for future flights.		Our destination has numerous alternate airports near it and en route. The weather was forecast to be VFR/scattered clouds with light winds.The Tower could have anticipated the long roll out necessary for landing aircraft and communicated this to Approach Control. The combination of both agencies could have built a better spacing plan for arriving aircraft. The Tower could have advised all arriving aircraft to plan on rolling to the end of the runway, due to taxiway construction. This would have been a good cue for all aircraft that tight spacing on final would lead to a problem on landing.		Despite using all available resources to save fuel enroute, delays due to runway changes and a spacing problem with preceding aircraft, which forced a go-around, resulted in a B737-800 flight crew arriving with only 3,600 LBS of fuel.

The left clip board kept falling off and the First Officer was using all the actively advocating that it should be fixed because if he was incapacitated I couldn't read his and mine would be on the floor somewhere. Maintenance finally thought of taping the clip board in the aft position so that I could still operate the window lock but it wouldn't fall off so I and First Officer finally agreed it was safe and maintenance and Flight Duty Manager and everyone were telling us it was legal and safe. Our real questions are WHY wasn't the MEL updated to call it a clip board/chart holder/Evacuation Checklist which is what was glaringly absent on MEL and right away makes us question whether in all the changes this MEL allowance was not looked at adequately now that the Emergency Checklist was attached to it. Then before landing the next big problem presented itself when the sun went down and I turned the chart light on it illuminated where the Evacuation Checklist would be normally forward BUT in its taped position aft NOT A SINGLE WORD OR LETTER WAS ILLUMINATED and that I wrote up. Another question, is the chart light on the hot battery bus?  What I liked about the Emergency Evacuation Checklist on paper in the center is that each pilot could access easily and move the card to ANY available light source and since we all have different eye strength the card could be moved closer or farther away to read easily and the card could be moved in the direction of the next switch to be moved instead of looking hard to the side to read the clip board checklist.  The clipboard/checklist HAS NONE of the above advantages so should be moved back in my opinion.				A B777 Emergency Evacuation Checklist installed on a clip board which kept falling off its sidewall attachment next the Captain but maintenance's work around did not position it for use under all emergency lighting conditions.

It was our first leg together, although the new Captain had flown 4 other legs the day prior with another LCA. The aircraft was put on a maintenance deferral for an unexplained Proximity Switch Electronic Unit (PSEU) light on the inbound flight. During the departure brief, I mentioned to the Captain that the PSEU light can be related to the over-wing exit door locks, and that we might see the light again on this flight. Ground operations were uneventful up to the takeoff event. On takeoff roll immediately after I made the '80 KTS, throttle hold, power normal,' call we got a master caution light with a 'doors' light on the annunciator panel. I took control of the aircraft calling, 'Abort, my aircraft,' and initiated the abort. We stopped quickly and were able to exit left on Taxiway Delta. We held between the runways on a taxiway to have the fire trucks look us over before taxiing to the gate. We did so because the Tower called and said they saw some smoke coming from one of our tires during the abort. While waiting we accomplished the aborted takeoff considerations in the QRH and looked up our brake energy chart in the operations manual. The Fire Chief saw no damage nor did we have hot brakes. We then taxied to the gate uneventfully. The aircraft required a single tire change due to one tire locking up for a short time on the reject and having a spot worn through 2 layers of cord. Throughout the entire event I kept the passengers informed including making the 'discontinued takeoff' PA recommended in the FOM. I believe it was between 90-100 KTS when I initiated the RTO (although I know that most of these events show them at a much higher speed than we think they occur!). I know this is higher than the 80 KTS called for in our company procedures, but in the heat of the moment I made this call. Factors that may have led me to this decision were the following: 1) unfamiliarity with the upgrading Captain on one of his first takeoffs in the aircraft, with me being in the slightly unfamiliar First Officer seat; 2) due to the light weight of the aircraft the fact that we were less than 2,000 FT down the 11,890 FT runway; 3) expecting a possible door problem with the unexplained PSEU light; and 4) probably being too spring loaded to take the jet on the Captain's first takeoff and not 'chair flying' these events enough before the takeoff roll started.				A B737-800 Line Check Airman in the right seat rejected a takeoff while instructing a new Captain after the DOORS annunciator light illuminated at about 90 KTS.

The B-767 Autothrottle arm switch is a square button under the glareshield on the Captain's side with a green bar light for 'engaged.'  It is SOP on takeoff roll to push the engage button if the First Officer calls out that the autothrottles have failed to go to 'TOGA' during T/O roll... no problem.   The exact same position on the B-777 has a similar appearing switch which engages the Autopilot.  If, as has happened more than once, a former B-767 Captain is advised during T/O roll that TOGA has not engaged, he may revert to old habits and push the button getting the expected green light.  All is well until he tries to rotate as the A/P is trying to hold 'level.'  Resulting high speed heavy weight aborts (plane seemingly won't fly) at well over V1 have all been successful thus far (greater than balanced field length), but it is only a matter of time.   Previous efforts to call attention to this have failed.  Suggest quick fix of plastic clear (flip up) cover over A/P switch.  It works.  There is never a need to rapidly engage the A/P.  Not elegant, I know - preventing accidents rarely is.				A B777 Captain noted a potential confusion for upgrading B767 Captains because his B777 fleet's autopilot engage switch is near where his B767 fleet's TOGA button is located and so pilots could engage the autopilot for takeoff instead of setting TOGA power.

Flaps 10 and gear down approaching glideslope at 4000 MSL, intercepted the LOC and tailwind 20 plus knots.  Speed crept up to 200-205 knots, initially from 190, and slowed to 180.  Selected Flaps 15 and continued to slow.  At Flaps 25 at 1000', Tower cleared a BE-200 for takeoff on my runway as we passed 1000'!  10L had a small aircraft landing short final.  Large thunderstorms were at the departure end of the runway with a low ceiling and a slow climbing King Air in front of me.  I elected to configure and land to avoid a mess at the end of the runway, had I chosen to go around.  I landed on speed, configured, and exited at D intersection with no problems.  I elected to land because a go-around closely behind a King Air climbing and a low ceiling with thunderstorm and numerous small aircraft in the pattern would/could have been very dangerous and we were stable and on glideslope, although late configuring. The First Officer and I discussed the issue quickly and we agreed to continue instead of going aroundApproach Control could have told us there was a 20+K tailwind on final, while calm on the runway.  Tower should not have cleared a takeoff in front of us when we were at 1000! It left us with few options!  We were ready to go around until the King Air took off.				A B737-700 Flight Crew opted to land out of a moderately unstabilized approach rather than execute a go around into weather and other, slower, departure aircraft ahead of them.

It appeared that the Captain's instrument bus had failed but there were no lights indicating that that is what actually happened. The source selector was placed in the both on right position with no effect.While going through the checklist we missed a frequency change, since we had not yet switched to the VHF #2 radio. Since we had passed our normal descent point with no contact from Center we squawked 7600 and then when we decided it was time to start the descent we changed the squawk to 7700 and commenced the descent. Shortly thereafter we receive an ACARS message from Dispatch to contact Center and were given the proper frequency. We then switched to the #2 VHF radio and reestablished contact with Center.At no time were we able to restore the Captain's instruments so the First Officer continued to fly the approach and get the aircraft on the ground. We did not have a bus off light or any indication of a generator failure so it was a little confusing as to just what our exact problem was. We knew we had lost a bus but did not get the indications we expected to get to identify exactly which.Upon landing the left thrust reverser would not deploy and the First Officer elected to use no reversers at all. At the gate maintenance found a standby bus circuit breaker popped and speculated that it could have been caused by the First Officer's bag, which he hangs from the bar by the back window. Since the First Officer was flying the aircraft at the time of the incident and in smooth weather conditions we do not think his bag had any effect of the circuit breaker popping, but do not know for sure.				A B737-800 flight crew encountered numerous system failures when the Circuit Breaker for the Captain's standby buss opened. Maintenance speculated the First Officer's bag, which was hung in a place and manner which placed it in proximity to the breaker, may have struck and opened the breaker.

While eating my breakfast in cruise at FL280 my First Officer and I heard a loud popping noise from the rear of the cockpit. Looking back he noticed some smoke rising from my computer bag located behind my seat. We also detected some strange-smelling fumes. He promptly put on his oxygen mask and I told him to continue to fly the airplane and talk to ATC as necessary while I attempted to resolve the situation. Getting up out of my seat, I observed that the smoke was coming from my lithium battery powered flashlight. I promptly took the flashlight out of the bag and placed it in an open space on the floor close to the cockpit door. While the flashlight smoke started to subside (very quickly) we turned off the cabin fan switch and placed the pack flow switch to high to increase the fresh air flow. The Purser called the cockpit and informed me that there was the smell of fumes in the forward lavatory. After explaining what had happened I told her that we appeared to have solved the problem and that we would continue on to destination. I referred to the FM and FOM to make sure we had 'covered all the bases.' With the smoke and the fumes gone we proceeded on to our destination and the First Officer made an uneventful (and smooth) landing.		A320 flight crew reports a lithium battery failure in a flashlight stored in the Captain's computer bag. The failure is announced by popping noises and smoke rising from the bag.

Flight was climbing to FL320. One of the Flight Attendants called to the flight deck and notified us of two issues. Issue number one CABIN PRESS annunciation on Door 2R was flashing. This indicates that 2R door handle is not in the full down and locked position. Issue number two, Door 2R would not remain armed. Door 2R would only show remained armed as long as the slide arming handle was held in armed position. As pilots, both of us were concerned that the door handle was no longer in the full closed position. It was our understanding that if the cabin door is not closed then the cabin door will not arm. We questioned the aircraft integrity if we had a problem where the door could come open in flight. The Flight Attendant confirmed that the handle was down, but we had two separate indications that the Door 2R security is now in question. If the door opened at any speed it would be devastating. Having the Flight Attendant adjust/move handles on the door would not be a safe course of action in case of malfunction with two separate indications showing Door 2R not closed and secure. Dispatch contacted us regarding a joint Dispatch/Maintenance decision to return and land. They wanted us to return to the departure airport. In the following five minutes we received three ACARS messages to return. About ten minutes later we received an ECAM for Brake SYS 1 Fault. We notified Dispatch and Maintenance Control. After that Maintenance Control still wanted us to land over weight. At this time with a Brake SYS fault and a Door security issue known, Dispatch/Maintenance still wanted us to land overweight. My concern as Captain was the 'meta message' or what wasn't being said. Dispatch sent ACARS messages to us indicating that he was checking the QRH and penalties. A short time later we received the go ahead to land overweight after confirming with Maintenance Control. Again, my concern was that Maintenance must be concerned about the aircraft if they still wanted us to land overweight with a Brake fault. As pilots we entered a very high workload period. We received a clearance to return from ATC. Now we had a little more than 45 minutes to enter a new destination, runway, RNAV arrival, complete the BRK SYS 1 FAULT QRH, verify all charts in QRH and Pilot handbook, communicating with Operations about a gate, notifying passengers about a return to the departure airport and keeping them updated, and keeping flight attendants and passengers informed about precautionary landing. On downwind we finally completed all QRH, Checklist and PH section (as a precaution) about Loss of All Brakes, as noted in the QRH procedure. We then declared an emergency with ATC. We then re-verified that all charts and QRH Checklist had been completed. Before touchdown we had Door 2R issue and Brakes SYS 1 fault. We landed with a touchdown of 100 FPM and monitoring brake temp did not exceed 800C. A max brake temperature of 545C was noted. After landing I was made aware that this aircraft had a history of door issues previously. This served to validate my concern at the time, that Maintenance and Dispatch had good reason to request that we get the aircraft on the ground ASAP. I believe this event illustrates the relationship between Dispatch, Maintenance and pilots at this Air Carrier. As a pilot I try to get all of the information I can regarding a problem and then use my experience to find the safest solution to that problem. I don't have all of the answers and I rely on the expertise provided by the Crews, Dispatch, Maintenance, Operations, ATC, and my crew in the cabin. I relied heavily on the perception that Maintenance and Dispatch both wanted the aircraft back on the ground. Although the aircraft remained pressurized we felt that it was not a given that it would continue to remain pressurized. The decision (right or wrong) in our minds, after deciphering all of the other information presented, was the intent was to get theaircraft on the ground ASAP. There has been speculation that we should have burned down to landing weight before we landed. The First Officer and I discussed this at length and attempted to sway Dispatch/Maintenance toward that end, to validate our concerns, at least twice. Instead our course of action was validated by the continued insistence that we continue and land overweight. Our reliance, especially on Maintenance, to give us the information we need can be tainted by goals or objectives that don't match ours, from a pilot's perspective. For those that have the luxury of looking at these events after the fact and with the benefit of knowing the outcome, (myself included) it can appear pretty clear cut. This discussion would be completely different had the door come open while we were burning down to landing weight.				An A320 had a Main Cabin Door CABIN PRESS annunciation. The door would not remain armed. Returning to the departure station the ECAM alerted BRK SYS 1 FAULT. An emergency was declared and an over weight landing was made.

Takeoff and departure uneventful. At FL390, line of weather extending from our departure airport northeast with lots of convective activity.  Our flight was on top of all weather. After crossing the frontal boundary and without notice, winds increased to 105 knots out of the west (strong tailwind) and airspeed surged to about 5-10 knots into the red band (overspeed) and clacker sounded.  Throttles manually retarded to 70% N1 and airspeed reduced back toward .78M but continued a slow decrease without any automatic addition of thrust from either engine toward selected Mach.  Thrust then manually added to selected cruise 'CLB' setting (green carrot on N1 gauge) and engines did not respond. In addition, airspeed continued to slowly decrease.  After about 10 seconds, Captain selected engine Anti-ice ON and after approximately 5 seconds the thrust from both engines responded as selected. Both events, airframe overspeed and lack of response with autothrottles engaged, were recorded in aircraft maintenance logbook and a thorough discussion with Maintenance upon arrival.		Flight departed late due to weather passing through the area. We received a reroute to the our south eastern destination for weather avoidance. Once airborne and at cruise altitude FL390, (all climb and cruise checklists completed) we determined that we were well above the tops of the front and we requested a turn more south easterly to save gas and time. Shortly after the turn, we noticed about a 105 knot direct tailwind. Flight conditions were flight level 390, on top of weather, continuous light to moderate chop, FMC optimum altitude 39.5 / FMC maximum altitude 41.0, LNAV/VNAV with FMC window opened flying .78 Mach. Auto Throttles ON. SAT -53/ISA 4. We noticed the airspeed get slower, to approximately .74 then return to .78 few minutes later. Then speed goes from .78 to an overspeed condition, approximately 8 seconds of the overspeed clacker sounding. I reduced throttles to approximately 70%. The Captain applied 'medium to light' speedbrakes, with the airspeed returning to .78. We simultaneously stowed speedbrakes and increased the throttles back to normal cruise N1. That's when we noticed that the engines (both) did not respond to throttle movement and the airspeed again started to 'bleed off' for approx 5-10 seconds. The engine N1s (both) stayed at approximately 70%. The Captain applied engine anti-ice (although we had been in the clear above the weather the whole time, SAT 53) and the engines both came back to normal climb N1 speed as well as the airplanes airspeed stabilized at .78 with no more increases or decreases in airspeed. Although I believe that both the Captain and myself did nothing wrong, every phase of flight was by the book I have 12 yrs and approximately 5700 hrs in the 737 and have never witnessed the aircraft perform in this manner. In the future I may not cross over the top of a frontal boundary of weather with the winds as high as they were.		A B737-800 crossed a convective frontal boundary and after the tailwind increased to 105 kts the airspeed decreased to MACH .74, then oversped before returning to .78. But the airspeed then bled off until the crew intervened to increase N1.

He verified that the switch was in the neutral position and asked me if I had heard him. I had heard him through my headset. He cycled the PTT switch to get it to stop transmitting. About 10 seconds later, ATC asked if we were on frequency. We had discussed the possibility of a stuck mic during crew briefing because there are reports that this is occurring frequently. The last communication that we received from Company Flight Operations declared that the switch was not the problem and could not be the problem. I've talked with several Mechanics that have told me that the failure rate of this switch is much higher than the previous switch that we used. If this is indeed the case, it would be proper for a correction and clarification as to what the problem might/could be so that better vigilance could be demonstrated by flight crews until such a time as a fix can be made. This is an extreme safety issue. It's not if, but when, another Company aircraft's communication is compromised which could result in the crew being unable to communicate with ATC.				A B737-700 First Officer's push to talk microphone switch stuck in the transmit position blocking the ATC frequency, repeated switch activation returned it to OFF.

The new Sabre Flight Plan (OFP) works in conjunction with ETOPS regulations and has some wonderful qualities as well as a few serious deficiencies. To appreciate one serious flaw, it is important to understand the genesis of ETOPS procedures. THE FEDERAL REGULATION Originally under FAR 121 and Advisory Circular 120-42A (December 1988), there were two defined classifications of airports. (1) 'Adequate Airport' was defined as an airport with facilities that made them an acceptable diversion airport - weather permitting because of runway dimensions, instrument approaches, and airport facilities. There is a catalog of Adequate Airports for the remote areas we transit. There is NO guarantee of acceptable weather conditions at Adequate Airports. (2) 'Suitable Airport' was an Adequate Airport where a pilot could reasonably expect weather conditions, ceiling, visibility, wind direction and velocity and that would allow the successful completion of an instrument approach. When within 60 minutes of an Adequate Airport, ETOPS rules do not apply. In remote regions of the world where modern airports are further apart, this policy provides only a POTENTIAL destination for an emergency diversion. ETOPS rules apply ONLY to flights which are MORE than 60 minutes from an Adequate Airport, which then must also be a Suitable Airport. Twenty years later, AC 120-42B (6/13/2008) eliminated the definition of a Suitable Airport from its Glossary. According to Boeing's description, the term 'Suitable Airport' was replaced with 'ETOPS Alternate' which does appear in the newer Glossary. There is no mention of Decompression Alternates, Intermediate Alternates, or other terminology introduced by Sabre. If an aircraft experiences an emergency that requires diversion and the closest Adequate Airport is continuously WITHIN 60 minutes at single-engine cruise speed, the aircraft is now in trouble. The aircraft was NOT operating under ETOPS rules and the OFP does not identify an ETOPS Alternate where it might successfully divert. The aircrew is unable to conduct an instrument approach to that airport since no diversion plan was ever provided. Sabre produces voluminous printed resources - pages of NOTAMS, current and forecast weather, PIREPS, maps, winds aloft, maintenance data, and mind boggling detail at each and every published and computed fix. To absorb all that information would require preflight planning to begin before the information becomes available. However, absent a predetermined diversion plan, it is incomplete. Until now, it had NOT been a problem because we treated all Pacific flights as ETOPS flights shortly after passing over the Canadian border going westbound. ETOPS Alternates were always identified during pre-flight and ETOPS airport weather conditions updated when entering the ETOPS area. However, the Sabre flight plan can create a route to remain within 60 minutes of a series of Adequate Airports. That flight is only subject to ETOPS rules when it strays out of those 60 minute ranges. The solution for any emergency requiring diversion is to 'Land at the Nearest Suitable Airport'. Under the new terminology, that means ONLY an ETOPS Alternate. When experiencing a serious degradation of fuel, engine, hydraulics, pressurization, and other aircraft systems, a mere Adequate Airport is of little or no value. An unsuccessful instrument approach to weather below published minimums will result in either a surface accident or squandering valuable fuel. At 480 KTS TAS, a 60-minute range limit for assigning ETOPS Alternates has a short shelf life, particularly if the potential divert field is behind the aircraft. Under the best circumstances, completing the non-normal procedures, establishing communications, and coordinating a plan with ATC and Dispatch is time-consuming. When you add to the list the elapsed time attempting to understand and rectify a problem and avoid the diversion, the 60-minute limit becomes irrelevant. The Company can unilaterally return to the policy of operating all Asian and Polar flights with ETOPS dispatch standards and procedures. The aircraft will be operating on the same routes and altitudes and experiencing the efficiencies that Sabre provides. However, ETOPS Alternates will continue to be provided to the flight crews during flight planning, even if not required by the ETOPS regulations. For standardization, the Pacific operation will mirror the Atlantic operation where Adequate Airports are all more than 60 minutes apart and ETOPS procedures are unavoidable.				B777 Captain laments the lack of ETOPS alternates during pacific flights provided by the Sabre flight planning program due to always being within 60 minutes of an adequate airport.

At approximately 1,100 FT AGL, having just finished scanning the airport and runway environment, I noticed in the corner of my eye a bright green light being emitted just over the nose of the aircraft from the ground. Since it was peculiar that a green light would be flashing in the darkness below, I looked at the green light directly and it filled my eyes with intensity. I immediately felt some pain in my left eye, followed by seeing dark spots in my vision. From the intensity of the light beam and the pain in my left eye, I knew immediately that my eye had been hit by a laser. I reported this to my First Officer and asked him if he had seen a green laser light. He answered that he did not. He asked me if my vision was impaired. I answered yes, but only in my left eye. I instructed him to continue the approach and landing. After landing, we taxied safely to the gate. We reported the incident to the Control Tower. They mentioned that they had two aircraft hit by a green laser the night before. The next day, I visited a doctor [and] he reported that I had two abrasions on my left eye. He prescribed an antibiotic and that my eye should heal up in about 2-3 days.				An A320 Captain reported he sustained abrasions on his eye after being targeted by a laser on approach to PHX.

The PF selected 'direct REEBO'.From previous experience flying into SAN from the north, I recalled always receiving clearances restricting descent to 5000 MSL until south of the MZB 084 radial to remain in the Class B airspace. Although we were approaching from the northeast, I recalled this restriction and I verified we were south of that radial before the PF set 4000 as his intended minimum altitude until passing abeam VYDDA. Shortly after descending below 5800 MSL, ATC advised us that we were exiting the Class B airspace and would re-enter crossing the JULIAN VOR 186 radial.  Once aware of our descent below the Class B we immediately reduced our airspeed as we had been maintaining 250K. With the airspeed issue resolved, the visual approach was concluded uneventfully.  All information to prevent this occurrence is carried in the aircraft. Unfortunately, it is spread over many different pieces of paper and navigation equipment displays.  More detailed study of the San Diego Class B airspace would have revealed the higher floors east of VYDDA. There are two paper charts in the Jeppesen shipset displaying this airspace, but the side window clipboard holds the airport diagram for use immediately after landing while the yoke clipboard holds the approach chart backing up the visual procedures. There is simply no 'extra' space available to put more paper charts.Technology exists to superimpose airspace boundaries on the NAV display. For some reason, this technology is available for retrofit in a 40-year old single engine piston airplane, yet our high tech airline refuses to make this information available to its air crews.Perhaps most important is the casualness with which this Class B violation occurred. The Company, despite published directives, informally subscribes to a policy of 'keeping the speed up' even though it is clearly a violation of the regulations. This implied approval diminishes the fact that the act is a violation whether filed as a Pilot deviation or not. Once it becomes the norm to break minor rules, it is easy to break a few of the larger ones because 'no one cares' anyway.		I turned the aircraft directly to the FAF for the SAN LOC 27 and set 4000' in the MCP Altitude since it would keep us clear of terrain as we continued our visual approach. At about 5600' MSL, SOCAL Approach informed us that we had dropped out the bottom of the SAN Class B airspace...		Cleared for a visual approach to Runway 27 at SAN, the Flight Crew of a B737-700 descended below the Class B while maintaining 240-250K.  Approach advised them of their situation, they slowed and completed the approach successfully.  The Captain addressed his concerns about limited timely access to Class B information and  company culture of '...keeping the speed up...' as contributing factors.

In this event, Boston Tower cleared us to land on Runway 27 and told us that another aircraft would be landing on an intersecting Runway 22L. The phraseology seemed non-standard and was perhaps chosen to avoid mention of LAHSO. I chose to land only if the other aircraft had been given and acknowledged a turn off and taxi instruction prior to our touchdown. This happened approximately one to two seconds before our landing. This is to say we could not possibly have waited any longer before commencing a go-around. I believe this is a case of Boston Tower attempting to continue to move airplanes using what is essentially LAHSO without calling it that. I think this is well intentioned but inappropriate. I have not been trained in LAHSO and don't know the procedures in the event of, for example, a simultaneous go-around. Of course, the conservative choice would have been for me to go around, but I chose to operate on the principle that an aircraft on the runway that has accepted taxi instructions is not a landing aircraft, but a taxiing one. I didn't make this up myself; I had it spelled out on the radio to me by ATC, and I see it in use at several airports, including LGA during day-to-day operations. Don't misunderstand; I have no idea if this is true in a legal sense. I just know it seems to be SOP and so I used it as a way to manage the situation without simply giving up and going around.		On approach to land on Runway 27 at Boston, a small aircraft was given clearance to land on an intersecting Runway 22L. The terminology used by ATC seemed similar to the approval for Land and Hold Short Operations, though not using that specific phraseology (aircraft was cleared to taxi ahead and exit at a particular taxiway during its landing roll). We were prepared for a go-around if LAHSO would have seemed to become the result. The pilot monitoring had a better view of the landing aircraft and the terminology better than I had and talked about a plan for it during the approach. Our determination was that the other aircraft was landing just prior to us and was given a taxi clearance prior to our landing; therefore, it was acceptable in our procedures. I'm not sure if LAHSO is the exact intent of the ATC Controller but it seemed similar. More education on the procedure and terminology of the ATC Controller's intent and on LAHSO in general would be of benefit to me.		Air Carrier landing Runway 27 at BOS voiced concern regarding ATC's 'de facto' use of LAHSO procedures without referring to them as LAHSO. The reporter noted the absence of formal LAHSO training as a concern.

I assumed he had a very upset stomach. He told me to land the aircraft and that he had to go into the forward lav. At this time we were descending through approximately 1,500 FT on the approach. Since we were configured for the landing and were on profile I elected to continue rather than declare an emergency and complicate matters any more. The approach to landing was uneventful. Upon clearing the runway I opted to continue taxiing to the gate not knowing the extent of Captain's situation. I wanted to get the aircraft to the gate as soon as possible.

It has become so confusing and convoluted that choosing the correct chart is difficult at best and a guessing game at worst. As a Relief First Officer, the flying pilots and I spent over fifteen minutes debating which combination of arrival and approach charts were the correct ones to use. There are two separate issues I believe are creating most of the confusion. First, the number of temporary charts for the entire NRT/RJAA coverage makes it difficult to determine which chart is correct on any given day. There is not much guidance on some of the charts as to which ones should be used when. There were three separate charts available to fly the ILS to 34L, all of which we found a reasonable argument as to why it might be the proper chart to use. I am sure there is some rhyme or reason to the organization of the charts but it is not clear to the average line pilot what it is. I doubt I am the only one who finds it confusing and a ripe area for problems to develop when the wrong chart is used inadvertently.My suggestion for improvement is to find a reasonable balance between the lawyers' need to cover every possibility for charting and the pilots need to be able to figure out reasonably which chart to use. I understand the need for detailed charting when a navaid will be out of service for some time. But having three arrivals with the same name is begging for problems. If the CVC VOR will be out of service until June 2012, then issue the charts with procedures that do not require the CVC VOR and limit it to one chart per name, not two or three. Then reissue the charts in June when the navaid is returned to service. Additionally the ATC controllers should be briefed to be clear and specific in their issuance of clearances. 'Cleared for the ILS Z to 34L,' for instance and not just, 'cleared for the approach.'				B777 Relief Pilot expresses confusion over the letter designations of the various approaches at RJAA and the temporary revisions to all procedures due to a VOR outage.

When we were cleared to FL260 the First Officer had the B autopilot in CMD using CWS-P to descend as the aircraft was high on the profile.  Prior to FL260 the aircraft seemed to be transitioning for a level off at FL260. With CMD selected on the autopilot, we had a green CMD, an amber CWS-P, and ALT/ACQ all illuminated on the FMA.  Despite the indications the aircraft flew through FL260 at about a 600-700 FPM rate of descent. The First Officer was quick to disconnect the autopilot and return to FL260, but the aircraft descended about 220 FT below FL260.  ATC did inquire at what altitude we were as we were returning to FL260. We explained that our autopilot did not level off as we expected and we had returned to FL260. No further deviations occurred. We notified Maintenance through Dispatch, made a logbook entry, and proceeded to our final destination on schedule under MEL provisions		I disengaged the autothrottles, reduced the thrust to idle, deselected VNAV, and manually pitched for descent with the A/FD in CMD+LNAV. The Captain and I both made the 1000 FT callout and I prepared to manually advance thrust levers for the aut-pilot level off. Approaching FL260, the FMA pitch indication changed from CWS-P to ALT ACQ, but the autopilot failed to level off. By the time I disengaged the autopilot and corrected the pitch attitude to return to FL260, we were approximately 300 FT below FL260.		High on the arrival, the flight crew of a B737-700 abandoned VNAV when cleared to FL260. Although they received appropriate FMA advisories the aircraft failed to level at their cleared altitude. The First Officer disconnected the autopilot and returned manually to the assigned altitude.

I feel the chart is poorly designed as the restriction is in view during the briefing, but gets folded out of view during the departure.

Rotation was initiated and we got the Configuration Warning horn and a stick shaker for five seconds.  Flaps 1 was retracted on schedule.  Looking at the LED Annunciator showed all LE devices in Amber Transit. The view from flight deck showed LE devices extended both sides.  Started reviewing QRH Flaps, Leading Edge: LE Flaps Transit.  Aircraft was flown at 230 knots.  Above 10,000', we advised ATC of warning light and that no emergency was being declared.  Called and asked Operations for a patch to Dispatch. Started talking to flight attendants, passengers, and Company Pilot riding in cabin, who told me LE devices were extended.  Went back to the QRH and now was talking to Dispatch.  Were going through about FL 200 and heard pop sound.  (Later we found out it was LE Actuator #4 failing.)  Dispatch got back to us and told us to go back to the departure airport for Passenger consideration. We ask for vectors back.  Called Flight Attendants and Pilot in cabin for any more information. Pilot told me of hydraulic fluid flowing over wing.  Hydraulic quantities were good.  The plane was flying well.  Advised passengers of return to the departure airport and estimated time of arrival.  Went back to QRH.  Reviewed landing configuration and we talked about it, but now I had to get ATIS and landing performance information.  Got all that out of the way but forget to execute it in FMC!  On final visual XXL, flaps 15+5 not 15+15. Speed was in minimum maneuvering band. Still didn't realize our mistake. I went to the performance reference and selected flaps more than 1 less than 15 speeds and selected flaps 10 with max autobrake. Rest of approach and landing were uneventful. Checked brake cooling time of 30 minutes.  At gate, met with Maintenance and called Chief Pilot on Call. Logbook writeup was made.  Went on to next flight to our destination.		After the flaps were raised, the LE Flaps Transit light remained illuminated and slats 1 and 8 could be seen from the cockpit as partially extended. I requested radar vectors back to [departure airport]. We continued the QRH with the During Configuration for Landing (Trailing Edge Flaps Extended) portion of the checklist. The performance data was reviewed and VREF/Target speeds were set in the FMC. However, while flying I missed the PM reading Note L stating the speed would be VREF 15 + 15. The speeds set in the FMC were VREF 15 only. I feel that hand-flying the aircraft took some of my attention away from following what the PM was reviewing in the QRH. Since the autopilot was off, I could have had the PM fly the aircraft and also reviewed the procedure while we had a couple of minutes while being radar vectored back to the airport. I think we should have stayed closer to [the departure airport] while we worked the QRH and made decisions. I think a quick review of the landing portion of the QRH on final approach would have led us to our error. Instead we chose a safe but different option. Since the Descent Checklist is from the QRH another quick review of the correct landing configuration by the PM may have caught our failure to set VREF 15 + 15.		A B737-700 leading edge flap actuator failed at V1 so the takeoff continued. After trouble shooting, the flight returned to the departure airport where an incorrect V speed was flown, putting the aircraft in the min maneuver range.

We were west of the enclosed area, but were hearing reports of light to moderate chop between FL350 and FL320. We turned on seatbelt sign and First Officer made an announcement. I called both ends of the cabin simultaneously to alert to chop in descent and told them to pack up. We were given [pilot's discretion] to FL200 and upon pulling for open descent we encountered light turbulence. I used the PA to seat the flight attendants before descending, passing FL350, and prior to any moderate chop. We had about 2 minutes of light to moderate chop and descended into smooth air for the duration of the flight. After landing, we debriefed with the lead Flight Attendant about an altercation with a Customer Service Agent prior to departure and were not told of any injuries from the chop on descent. Upon descent on a subsequent leg, we were alerted via ACARS to call the Duty Manager and only after landing did we learn that a Flight Attendant on the turbulence flight suffered an injury.		The evening after the flight, the Duty Manager informed the Captain that a Flight Attendant reported a 'turbulence' injury during our flight. We did receive a SIGMET via ACARS/Dispatch. I entered the fixes into the secondary FMS flight plan and displayed the SIGMET 'box' on my display. Our route of flight was outside the box to the west. We were in smooth air in cruise at FL360. Flights ahead of us were reporting poor rides. We decided to try a lower altitude before we reached the turbulence reported ahead of us. The Captain turned on the seatbelt sign and I requested a descent from ATC. We were cleared via pilot discretion to FL200 [and] we started down. Rides were reported to be smooth below FL320. During our descent, passing FL350, our ride started to get choppy. Captain got on the PA for the flight attendants to take their seats while I made a turbulence report to ATC. After the PA, we encountered moderate chop in the descent. The ride was smooth below FL320 and we continued to destination uneventfully. During a post flight debrief with the lead Flight Attendant, on another issue, he made no mention of any problems or injuries to passengers or other crew members.		A320 flight crew reports encountering turbulence, which is the subject of a SIGMET. The seatbelt sign is turned on and the flight attendants are asked to be seated prior to encountering moderate turbulence. On a subsequent leg, a Flight Attendant reports that he was injured by this turbulence.

I believe that it is important for those in the Flight Training Department to consider putting out more communications and perhaps a training video that shows examples of how to comply with our new standards. On our flight inbound to the station we were descending in visual conditions at 250 KTS. At approximately 25 miles from the airport and descending through 7,000 FT ATC gave us an assigned airspeed of 180 KTS. I was hand flying at this point so the pilot not flying went to set the airspeed on the MCP panel. There was some confusion in our flight deck as to what the pilot not flying should set in the airspeed window of the MCP. There was further confusion as to whether he should just set the speed in there, or wait for me to give him a commanded speed. In the old days the pilot not flying would have just set the assigned ATC airspeed into the MCP window, and I would have verified that the correct speed was in there. At our weight the Flaps 30 reference speed was 124 KTS. Based on this, which had previously been briefed, I thought the pilot not flying should set in a speed of 204 KTS in the MCP window. He wanted to set in 180 KTS, as that was what we had been assigned by ATC. Then there was the question back to me, what speed would you like? I said to set the MCP window to 204 KTS. Then I started to second-guess myself. Was I supposed to have commanded a different speed than what ATC had just assigned, or should the pilot not flying have known what speed to set for clean maneuvering speed based on our clean configuration. Should I have briefed all of this beforehand, or should we all know the expectations ahead of time - predictability? As a technique, should we have written down or set the Flap 30 reference speed somewhere as a reminder or were we just supposed to remember the number? Would the fleet be better off to develop canned speeds that we always use versus having to look up and remember different speeds for each approach? Next was my flap 1 call out, - flaps 1-speed. Then the response back from the pilot not flying, do you want 180 KTS? I said, No, set 184 KTS, which was the flaps 1 minimum maneuvering speed. Then came my next call. Flaps 5 speed 180 KTS. From that point everything else went fairly smoothly during the remainder of the approach. There were 3 of us in the flight deck, each with a slightly different interpretation of how we were supposed to set the airspeed into the MCP window, what specific call outs we were supposed to make, and who was supposed to initiate the MCP airspeed setting process. After further discussion, I learned that just about every Captain during the first month following the turn on of Phase 2 did various methods of the SOP of how to properly slow the aircraft. There seems to be no standard that is understood by all pilots. In operations after my flight, I asked several other 777 Captains on how they would have done things and amazingly I got different answers from each of them. One of the Captains, like myself is an Line Check Airman (LCA), but yet neither of us were very confident that we were doing it right or even understood the proper interpretation of the SOP. I realize that with any change there will be a time frame necessary to integrate the procedures until they become second nature. I guess I am concerned that even after a month of having these new procedures in place there is still too much confusion amongst the line pilots on interpreting the proper SOP and the way it should be executed. If my flight was the anomaly, I would be OK with the status quo, but if others are still confused I would suggest getting a team of flight training center people together to figure out how to make all of this clearer. I'm not sure what the best way is to get a consistent message to our line pilots, but my initial thought would be to produce a brief video showing the proper call outs, that shows the pilot not flying and the pilot flying coordinating the art of slowing an aircraft the new way. We have 8 months before each of us will be exposed to a training cycle, which might be too long to allow different interpretations of the SOP to be prevalent out on the line. As an LCA, I am concerned that we have lost the predictability in each other, and feel that further communications on standardization would be appropriate.				A B777 crew is confused about the new procedure for setting the Mode Control Panel (MCP) airspeed during approach when the ATC commanded speed is below the current minimum maneuvering speed.

Pilot not flying accomplished ECAM procedure, stopped climb at FL280, then, shortly [after], FL290 for ATC. Contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control, confirmed climb no problem FL370. I had avionics issue and pressurization issues on my mind, leveled FL330 final. Extract valve full open. Upon landing noticed ECAM avionics smoke. Informed ATC and requested emergency equipment in case. Requested gate to deplane passengers, refused by ramp. We parked and waited for complete inspection from Maintenance and firemen. ECAM completed by First Officer on ground. My personal conflict: no checklist on dual failure of fans, only individual which leads to possible avionics overheat should procedure fail to open extract valve. If one fan fails have backup-dual failure must be rare, couldn't find checklist-took extra time to make sure on my part. Avionics smoke ECAM on ground was real, not sensor issue, per mechanic, we went to internal cooling configuration after landing but no fans available! According to Maintenance 30 or more minutes and serious overheat would have begun. If in flight the valve didn't open it would have lead to issue. Problem 2--why were we prevented from getting to gate and exiting passengers? Had we smelled smoke we would have had to evacuate with slides. The terminal and jetway should not take priority over exiting passengers ASAP. We had 104 passengers and handicap passengers. I voiced my concern 3 times to ramp and was denied access to gate until trucks blocked us. Flight attendants were given information and performed professionally; passengers were warned on ground of possible evacuation. Fireman were great and overall procedures were accomplished smoothly Dispatch and Maintenance were clear and concise. I found checklist lacking info with no dual failure, which in my view should be analyzed. According to Maintenance a computer failure caused the fans to stop operating.				A320 Captain experienced both avionics fans (blower and extract) failure during climb. After ECAM actions and consultation with Maintenance flight continued to destination. Upon landing an avionics smoke ECAM is triggered and quick access to a gate was requested from the company and denied.

At this time ATC assigns a vector heading for traffic. I instructed the First Officer to decline the heading due to 'minimum fuel' and cannot except any delays at this time. We did not declare an 'minimum fuel emergency' due to arrival fuel was above 30 minutes. We cross checked fuel burn and fuel on board to eliminate possible fuel leak, and continued with cross feeding. Approximately 2 minutes later left fuel tank started to increase fuel LBS, increasing to an arrival fuel of 4.4. ATC declared an emergency for us and gave us direct routing to our destination. We proceeded uneventfully, landed with 4.4 arrival fuel and were meet by Maintenance at the gate. Unexplained fuel anomaly.				An A320 developed about a 1,000 pound inter-tank fuel imbalance which also lowered the arrival fuel. After the crew refused a vector for minimum fuel ATC declared their emergency and gave a direct clearance.

While in contact  with Atlanta Center, we were descending to FL210.  We were cleared to cross HONIE at 14,000' and 250 kts.  I am fairly sure that the Atlanta Center Controller did not issue an altimeter setting for Atlanta, as I believe it is their policy to do.  However, because I was engrossed in conversation with the jumpseater, I didn't query ATC on the matter.  I simply read back the clearance, confirmed that the Captain (PF) set the  MCP and FMC correctly, then returned to our conversation with the jumpseating pilot.  Also around this time, the ACARS alerted us to a new ATL arrival ATIS.  I selected the ACARS on the MCDU, glanced at the new ATIS, noted the altimeter setting of 30.26, and preset my altimeter setting  to 30.26.  I also printed the ATIS, but did not  retrieve it from the ACARS printer.  Upon passing through FL180, I set my altimeter setting to 30.26, and I believe the Captain did the same thing.  Instead of running the Descent Checklist, the Captain and I returned to the conversation with the jumpseater.  We were handed off to ATL Approach, who cleared us to descend to 11,000'.  The Captain set 11,000' in the MCP and started the descent, and I verbally confirmed the same.  As our altitude approached 11,000, we got one, then two TCAS TA's on traffic which appeared to be at 10,300'.  When we leveled at what we thought was 11,000', we noticed that both TCAS targets were now 700' below us.  We both started to mention to each other that the situation didn't look right, but were interrupted by the Atlanta approach controller saying 'maintain 11,000'.  I replied, and he again repeated the clearance, along with something along the lines of 'check your altitude'.  I asked for the altimeter setting, and he read back '29.88'.  At this point, the Captain had disengaged the autopilot and begun to climb.  I reset my altimeter, then his, to 29.88.  It was evident at this point that we were a little more than 300' low.  The Captain flew the aircraft back to 11,000' and then asked me to re-engage the autopilot.  I then retrieved the ATIS printout from the printer, and read it.  For some reason, the ACARS had been delivering the (departure airport) ATIS to us the whole time, instead of the  ATL ATIS.  I realized that I failed to read the header line of the ATIS carefully, and did not notice the aberrant behavior of the ACARS ATIS function.  The Captain then called for the Descent Checklist, which we completed.THREATS: ongoing non-pertinent conversation in the flight deck (which we did conclude by 10,000'), failure of ATC to provide altimeter setting, aberrant ACARS behavior. ERRORS: failure to complete Descent Checklist at appropriate time, failure to read ATIS display/printout carefully.  Sometimes, going sterile at 10,000' isn't enough. Switching to any approach control marks the beginning of a busy phase of flight, and  consideration should be given to extending sterile cockpit from 10,000' to whenever we switch to approach control.	No new information was obtained from the reporter during the Callback conversation.	I was the flying pilot on this leg. During the descent from cruise altitude my First Officer, the jump-seater and myself were involved in a conversation. We retrieved the ATIS electronically and we setup for ILS PRM 28 approach. Prior to FL180, I briefed the approach to the First Officer. I did not brief the altimeter setting. Through FL180 I set up the altimeter based on the First Officer side of his display. That was the first error, not setting the altimeter setting from the ATIS printout. Second error in the chain of events was that I failed to ask for the descent checklist passing through FL180. Our final descent altitude was 11,000. I leveled off and soon after a TA was issued on the NAV display. A second airplane appeared and both were 700 FT below us. I realized it must be our altimeter setting and asked the First Officer to verify altimeter setting with ATC. At the same time ATC asked to level at 11,000 and check our altitude. I disconnected the autopilot and climbed 300 FT and set the new altimeter setting. The flight proceeded with no further incidents.		B737-700 flight crew reports distractions and omissions during descent on the HONIE arrival into ATL resulting in descent below assigned altitude.  ACARS ATIS update function had retrieved information from the departure airport, which resulted in an incorrect altimeter setting, and a conversation with the Jumpseater delayed completion of the Descent Checklist.

I inquired as to how they were feeling and if any of the passengers were experiencing the same effects. No passengers complained of the odor. I asked the flight attendants if they were feeling OK to perform their duties and both Flight Attendants B and C agreed to depart. During the course of the flight Flight Attendant C called the flight deck to give us info on how they were feeling, a little light headed and bad taste in their mouths and asked if we had an air quality report to fill out when we landed. We ACARSed maintenance and reported the problem and also wrote it up in the logbook. Upon arrival maintenance brought out the required report and I filled it out to the best of my ability with the help of Flight Attendants B and C. We checked on Flight Attendants B and C as to how they were feeling after the flight and told us they still were feeling light headed and bad taste in their mouth.  We are not sure of the event occurrence, possibly an APU oil leak into the bleed system but that would be a maintenance conclusion to what they found on the aircraft after a formal inspection.  A flow chart as to what steps the flight crew should follow in the event this occurs in the future [would be helpful]. Something like the RNAV or Deicing/Anti-icing flow charts that we presently use to help the flight crews get a better handle on the final outcome that will keep US all in the loop to provide a safe work environment for all crew members on the aircraft.	The Reporter had not heard from maintenance about the suspected cause of this event. He did say that he has flown the Airbus for many years and this type event is not rare especially during the summer months when the usual maintenance response is to MEL either the entire APU or just the APU air as a source for air conditioning. The Reporter qualified 'not a rare event' by saying that poor air quality is not a daily or monthly event but certainly frequently enough as not to be termed rare.			An A320 Captain reported the two aft Flight Attendants were light headed with an oily taste in their mouths during preflight. The flight continued to the destination where the symptoms continued after flight.

The night before with a very light aircraft it was the Captain's opinion that I rotated too fast. We discussed this issue for five or six minutes.  I agreed with him and noted (to myself) that I would watch his rotation on the current flight to try to get a feel for what he wanted and to compare it to what I usually feel is normal rotation. On the takeoff roll at VR, the Captain rotated and upon a positive rate called for landing gear up. Shortly after that, we received an Air Speed Low warning. The air speed indicator did not look correct for that configuration to me. I checked to see if we had both engines operating and the Captain advanced the power to max take off. At the very instant, I noticed that the landing gear was still down and the Captain noticed that the flaps were in the up position. We corrected the configuration and continued our climb. At altitude, we discussed the event. We both agreed that we remembered verifying the flaps position while doing the check list. We also did not have a Configuration Warning horn. The only likely conclusion was, I was distracted by paying close attention to the pitch command and rate the Captain was using and when he called for 'landing gear up' I must have retracted the flaps. I don't remember retracting the flaps, but there was no other logical explanation for the misconfiguration. During critical phases of flight, complete concentration should be paid to the task at hand. I believe that complacency led to this mistake by diverting my attention.		After becoming airborne, I called for gear up. The pilot not flying was concentrating on watching my rotation rate and instead of putting the landing gear up. He raised the flap lever from position 1 to the up position. I failed to notice the error. My first indication something was happening was seeing the flight director command a lowering pitch. I thought this odd, but followed it and started to look around. We both noticed the airspeed was not accelerating even with the lowered pitch and asked aloud if we had an engine problem/failure. The newly installed aircraft aural alert (Airspeed Low) sounded and, as this was a reduced thrust takeoff, I overrode the auto throttles and manually pushed the power up to the green climb N1 setting. I was prepared to select emergency thrust if things got worse, but the extra thrust seemed to be helping. It was then I noticed the flaps were up. I announced, 'You raised my flaps,' and I reset them to flaps 1. At this time, the pilot not flying noticed the gear was still down and he raised the gear. Everything returned to normal very quickly after that. My timing in mentioning the previous night's abrupt/rapid rotation could have been better. I had thought about it that night and thought I should mention it before we parted company. This was the last day we would be flying together.		A B737-700 First Officer's takeoff rotation was critiqued by the Captain so while concentrating on the Captain's rotation technique he raised the flaps with the 'Landing Gear Up' command which caused the low speed warning to alert.

A320 flight crew lost the Green Hydraulic System at FL360 and elects to divert to a suitable airport.

Difference in GPS latitude position of about 1.5 minutes, longitude was the same, didn't note what the GPS altitude read. Center calls us for an altitude check, says he was showing us 500 FT low, and TCAS also showed 500 FT low (compared to other cruise traffic in the area). All three altimeters never left FL290. Is this a known Airbus glitch? Does the Mode C normally get altitude input from the GPS? I see where this could have easily led to a TCAS RA with our aircraft reporting the wrong altitude, leading to an erroneous RA, and possibly having two aircraft both responding to RA's coming closer together,(worse yet, midair) instead of moving apart. After the ECAM disappeared, Center said he showed us back on altitude, and the TCAS showed all traffic in the vicinity back at cruise altitudes.				A320 Captain experiences an FMC/GPS position disagree at FL290 at the same time ATC informs the crew they appear to be 500 FT low. After three minutes the ECAM disappeared, and Center informed the crew they were back on altitude, and the TCAS showed all traffic in the vicinity back at cruise altitudes.

I went heads down to copy down the current ATIS and the Captain reached up to change our Open Descent to 3,000 to a V/S of 1,600 FT down to slow our rate of descent. I finished copying the ATIS and came heads up. Approach then called asking our altitude which was 2,300 FT. The Captain has inadvertently put 1,600 in the altitude select window (staying in open descent) rather than putting in a V/S 1,600 rate of descent. We immediately climbed back to 3,000 FT. Had we been IMC and the Controller not noted our mistake we could have ended in a mountain. In retrospect, I should have gotten the ATIS sooner but it was just changing.				Setting a desired rate of descent, 1,600 FPM, into the Altitude Alert window vice the Vertical Speed window proved only embarrassing to the flight crew of an A320. Had ATC not alerted them to their descent below their cleared altitude of 3,000 MSL the outcome could have been more alarming.

Denver reopened, and flight departed 52 minutes late.  DEN ATIS reported moderate-severe turbulence 50 miles northwest of Denver.  I ACARS'd dispatch and asked about arrivals.  He told us that there was moderate turbulence, and that the only severe report was by a small aircraft.  Out of FL290 on the RAMMS arrival, Approach advised of only light chop on the arrival. The next Controller advised the aircraft ahead of us that there was a report of moderate to severe turbulence from 14,000 to 13,300.  That flight responded a few moments later, 'Yeah, we go that turbulence you were talking about'.  We were cleared out of 17,000 to 13,000 and began the flight in 'open descent', at 250K in light turbulence and VFR conditions.   At 14,000 feet the aircraft encountered severe turbulence.  Airspeed dropped to 220K followed to by a jump to 290K. The aircraft pitched up and rolled to 30 degrees of left bank. The autopilot remained engaged and the aircraft slowly recovered to wings level flight. We requested a lower altitude, and the turbulence decreased to moderate as we descended to 10,000. We were in severe turbulence for approximately 1 minute. Pitch deviations were +/- 10 degrees, roll +/- 30 degrees, airspeed +/- 35 knots. Normal landing was made on Runway 16L. Prior to departure I had briefed both the flight attendants and the passengers of the weather conditions and emphasized the importance of honoring the 'fasten seat belt' sign. The Flight Attendants did a great job of 'battening down the hatches' prior to the arrival; there were no injuries to crew or passengers. Maintenance and Dispatch were advised after landing.				An A320 Flight Crew experienced forecast severe turbulence on descent into DEN but proper planning and coordination with the flight attendants and passengers helped avoid serious consequences from the encounter.

Departure Control issued an amended clearance to 7,000 FT MSL. After the pilot flying changed the MCP to 7,000 FT and the pilot not flying verified, the jet leveled off at 7,000 FT MSL. ATC advised of a VFR King Air approximately ten to twelve miles east, southbound, level at 7,500 FT MSL, and that he had the us in sight. The aircraft was observed, reported by pilot not flying to ATC, and then ATC issued clearance to maintain visual separation and cleared the flight to 13,000 FT. Both pilot flying and pilot not flying verified. MCP was changed to 13,000 FT and the pilot flying started an immediate climb at 250 KIAS. Within five seconds into the climb, with a rate of climb of approximately 2,500 FPM, the crew was alerted via TCAS with 'monitor vertical speed,' immediately followed by 'adjust vertical speed,' then 'descend,' followed by 'maintain vertical speed,' and then 'clear of conflict.' As the aural warnings were being given, the pilot flying was adjusting the flight path of the jet as expeditiously as possible, all the while maintaining visual separation with the sighted aircraft. The pilot flying estimated the distance of the aircraft to be five to seven miles, at the time of the initial aural alert, via both TCAS and eye sight. The end result was that our flight passed above and to the left of the King Air approximately 200 FT vertically and 1/2 mile horizontally. There was no known traffic call made by the King Air to ATC, or ATC to us during all this time. Upon landing and deplaning passengers, the pilot flying debriefed the crew (Flight Attendants and First Officer) and discussed the situation. The A Flight Attendant commented that one passenger had asked during his deplaning if the flight had come close to another aircraft during climbout. No other passenger was known to have commented. The flight continued on uneventfully after the turn. The unexpected climb interruption by ATC might have contributed to 'closing the gap' between subject aircraft in this situation. Leveling off and then given clearance to continue the climb led to the TCAS alerting the crew. When the pilot flying and pilot not flying initially saw the other aircraft, the only aircraft in sight, and TCAS showed the ATC altitude mentioned, the pilot flying felt comfortable that visual separation could be maintained without expecting the resulting alerts and situation. Given the fact that any crew does not know what the TCAS sees, the only result is that the crew accomplish the appropriate reactions as expeditiously as possible. In this case, there were no other aircraft observed visually and, at one point, the pilot not flying observed our aircraft above the TCAS displayed aircraft approximately 300 to 400 FT. It was during this time the pilot not flying recalled hearing the 'monitor vertical speed' followed by 'descend' and was just a bit confused to what he saw on TCAS, heard aurally, and saw visually.		ATC said if we could maintain visual separation, we could climb to 13,000 FT. I feel like the Captain was 'primed to climb'. I may be wrong about the exact timing, but I feel that the Captain began the climb while I was still reading back the clearance. I would've liked to stay at 7,000 FT, but we were climbing before I had a chance to convey that. Events unfolded quickly once the climb began. At about 7,200 FT, we received a TCAS RA of 'monitor vertical speed,' which required a pitch down of approximately five degrees. The Captain began a slow pitch over and we quickly received a 'descend' RA. I don't recall what the target descent was. I believe the Captain was trying to prevent floating our Flight Attendants so I'm not sure if he was reacting to the RA quickly enough. Three to four seconds (I believe) after the 'descend RA', we received an 'adjust vertical speed' RA, which required a climb of approximately 3,000 FPM. The intruder aircraft was getting fairly close at this point and the Captain was fixated on the aircraft outside the window so while a pitch up was initiated, we never reached the Vertical Speed target. I looked out the window and saw the intruder aircraft bank to the west to avoid us. I estimate the distance of the intruder as it passed our left wingtip to be a half mile and noticed -200 FT on the TCAS, but I can't be sure of the exact vertical separation as the intruder passed us. I believe from the time the Captain initiated the climb to the time the intruder passed us to be around 30 seconds.First and foremost, don't climb while maintaining vertical separation unless you are positive about the situation. The Captain thought the plane was heading southeast (basically paralleling our track), which is why he thought we were okay to climb. I wasn't sure and wanted to say something, but the climb was initiated while I was still on the radio. Better crew coordination could have prevented this by making sure we were both okay climbing visually. In hindsight, I should have gotten off the radio immediately and said to stay at 7,000 but, at the time, I didn't realize how convergent our flight paths were. The other possible prevention lies with ATC. I obviously don't know their requirements but at the time we were told to amend our altitude to 7,000 FT, we were established in a full climb power ascent with a Vertical Speed of at least 2,000 FPM. We both felt that if our climb wasn't interrupted that there would have been no issue. On a much more complex level, the TCAS system itself could be improved. I occasionally fly a Cessna 182 with TAS (Traffic Advisory system). This system isn't as complex as TCAS in that it doesn't issue RA's, but the huge advantage of this system over TCAS is that the intruder aircraft symbol includes a vector line so you know the direction the intruder is flying. I know with the number of targets we see on TCAS, maybe vector lines would clutter the display too much, but if it could be programmed to present a vector on a TA and RA that would greatly help situational awareness during these events.		B737 flight crew experiences a TCAS RA with a VFR King air at 7,500 FT after being cleared to climb if visual separation can be maintained.

However, after the sun set and during the descent, all three captain windows frosted completely over and there was absolutely zero visibility out of any of the Captain's windows. Maintenance and Dispatch were notified of the situation. I used my ID to scrape off the frost. Then I used paper towels to wipe off the remaining moisture with the heat of my hand. At about 500 FT AGL I was able to regain the visibility out of the forward window.				An A320 ECAM alerted ANTI ICE L WINDSHIELD (WINDOW) and later after sunset the window frosted over which required the Captain to remove the ice for forward visibility prior to landing.

NORM BRKS and AUTO BRKS showed inoperative on Status page. We had the same fault on the same airplane on the previous leg. In that instance, the fault cleared after the gear was cycled, so we tried it. It didn't clear the problem. ALTN BRKS appeared in green on the Wheels page, so we continued to landing. The runway was dry. The alternate braking system worked fine. No emergency was declared.		On approach, commanded gear down and a master caution, ding and ECAM showed again 'BRAKES AUTO BRK FAULT.' The proceeding flight, on the same aircraft had the same issue and Maintenance changed the BSCU box and cleared the write up. So the Captain used Emergency Authority in this situation and elected to continue the approach since the issue was the same and mental calculations of the landing distance was within the 10,000 FT long runway and the alternate brakes were in the green on the wheels page. The Captain did elect to raise the gear and lower the gear a second time to see if the condition would rectify itself like it did on the previous flight. It stayed the same. The Captain elected to not call Maintenance and Dispatch during this incident since it was exactly the same issue without the clearing of the status page and ECAM as what happened on previous flight. However, after landing at the gate the Lead Flight Attendant told the Captain that he called the aft Flight Attendants to be more aware of things for a possible evacuation with the cycling of the gear without notifying the flight crew, which the Captain thought was a wise situational awareness on the Lead Flight Attendants part.		A320 flight crew experiences normal brake failure when the landing gear is extended, as annunciated by the ECAM. The approach is continued to landing with alternate brakes functioning normally. The brake fault ECAM had occurred on the previous leg and maintenance had replaced the BSCU to no avail.

At that time we received a Master Caution light, ding, and the upper ECAM showed a yellow 'BRAKES auto brk fault' and status page showed inoperative system 'norm brk and auto brk'. I directed the First Officer to initiate a go-around, take the radios and keep the aircraft. Once on autopilot, I went into the auto brake fault irregulars checklist and computed an increased landing distance. However, the schematic showed inoperative system as only 'auto brk inop' but on the aircraft status page both 'norm brk and auto brk' showed inoperative status. That was when it became confusing and the Captain then was searching to see if it was the right irregular procedure because it didn't match the schematic in the Irregulars chapter. The Alternate Brake System showed in the green on the wheel page. Since we had 6,600 LBS of fuel I elected to call Local Maintenance to ask if there was anti-skid on the alternate brakes for landing to which they replied in the affirmative. The First Officer suggested rolling the fire trucks and I agreed to have him do so. At no time did I declare an emergency. In retrospect, though, we did everything as if it was an emergency. I called the Flight Attendants and told them what happened that no evacuation was necessary and time to landing. I did the Approach Descent checklist again and took over the radios and the First Officer prepared the plane to land once again. As soon as I put the gear down, the alternate brake system went into the green and the ECAM and status pages returned to normal. We elected to not use the auto brake system for landing, but to use manual normal braking. I canceled the fire trucks, but they elected to stay and followed us all the way back to the gate. I called Maintenance, wrote up the fault and we discussed what had happened. We kept the aircraft for the next leg after Maintenance found a BSCU servo problem, replaced the BSCU box and did a CAT III check.		[Narrative 2 has no additional information]		When they extended the landing gear on final approach the flight crew of an A320 received multiple ECAM brake and autobrake warnings. After going around they and following associated checklists the warnings extinguished when the gear was extended for the subsequent normal landing.

On this approach, which was a SIMULTANEOUS ILS to 19C, there are a set of SOP procedures and radio calls, none of which were used by ATC. Some aircraft were never told to contact Tower, some where; neither is correct. Tower is to be monitored on simultaneous approaches, and the marker is to be reported. The Tower Controller did not understand that he was to wait (unless a call is required for spacing/safety) for aircraft to check in with him at the marker. Where was the Final Monitor? Nothing could be communicated inside 10 miles due to confused aircrew trying to determine whether to stay, contact Tower, or monitor Tower. The Tower Controller then transmitted on his own frequency by attempting to contact every plane on final, without regard to their position. Several were there, several checked in upon changeover, and several were still on TRACON. This nonsense must stop. These controllers need to learn their jobs. In the past month, I have had these three things happen: 1. Directed by the DCA Tower to modify the LDA 19 by flying over the west bank of the river. This request was made while ON THE PUBLISHED INSTRUMENT APPROACH IN THE WEATHER which was at minimums for the approach. Upon later conversation, the Controller said that I ignored his direction. I informed him that in this situation there were only two possible communications; go around, or cleared to land. I had asked him for either; he gave neither, and repeated his request for me to modify the instrument approach procedure, while flying it in the weather. I continued with my previous clearance. He still does not understand what he did. 2. On approach to 14R at ORD, a Controller substituted the words 'mandatory area' for the words 'published segment of the approach'. Hey, I couldn't make this stuff up; but they do. 3. On the EAU8 into MSP I was re cleared direct to wildd.wildd1, fly the PRESS transition. This STAR has no transition. There is correct terminology to direct you past BITLR to the appropriate fix for the landing runway, and calling it a transition is not it. When I queried the Controller about the lack of a published transition, and the fact that I could not comply with his incorrect clearance, he complimented me on my understanding of the FAR's and went on to say that he had to give the wrong clearances, because other pilot's wouldn't understand what to do. I don't even know where to go with that one. He might be right. This is stupid and dangerous. We cannot have unqualified controllers out there 'free styling'; with procedures and terminology. It is bad enough that some idiot changed the former 'localizer' approach to an 'ILS' approach, glide slope out of service'. If the second half of that clearance ever gets cut out, people may die. If this situation where ATC controllers are ignorant of, or ignore the FAR procedures and terminology is not addressed, immediately, then the FAA administrator should be fired. The current situation is untenable, and I will most happy to testify to these acts of malfeasance at the hearings which are sure to come.				Air Carrier Captain voiced concern regarding ATC handling on a number of occasions in different locations.

First Officer was in the right seat and another First Officer was on the jump seat. The ATIS was reporting visibility of less than 800 meters and Low Visibility Procedures in Progress. Our departure clearance was given to us verbally because our ACARS request was rejected. We were cleared via Runway 09. We started our engines completed our check lists and called for taxi clearance. Ground Control cleared us to taxi to Runway 09 via Taxiway B. Ground reported that the RVR for Runway 09 was 300 meters at all 3 positions. Before releasing the brakes we all three verified our route and how many intersections we would pass prior to reaching the end of Runway 09, which was at Taxiways B and N5. When we reached N5 we stopped and mentioned there were red stop bar lights illuminated, for not entering the end of the runway. We contacted Tower and told them we were ready for take off, to which Tower replied, Runway 09, line up and wait. At that time the red stop bars were turned off. When we were taxiing onto N5 to line up and wait I thought I hear Tower say [to us], new departure clearance, CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF, FLY HEADING OF 030 DEGREES, CLIMB TO FL60. The First Officer read back the clearance. I then briefed our clearance as; I'm flying, fly heading 030 and climb to FL60. I then asked if we were cleared for take off to which the First Officer said yes, clear to go. The other First Officer did not confirm nor dispute the take off clearance. We lined up the aircraft on the center line lights and advanced the thrust levers and took off. At 1,500 FT Tower called and said, 'Are you aware you took off without clearance? The First Officer replied, 'Negative, you cleared us for take off and I acknowledge. Tower responded, 'Negative, I did not clear you for take off, I only gave you a new departure instructions. The First Officer responded, 'Well, we are already airborne but we apologize.' All three of us instantly realized how grave of an error we just committed! Low visibility and no take off clearance could have been disastrous! We all agreed that we thought we had heard 'CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF,' but now question what the Tower had said. I have always been very firm that anytime all three pilots are not 100% positive on an ATC clearance we ALWAYS confirm. Whether it is taxi instruction, take off clearance, frequency change, altitude change or whatever, I always insist on verifying. The question is why didn't we this time? The answer is there is no excuse. I do however believe the break down happen for a couple of reasons. Instructions from the Tower were in accented English, and he used the word take off. I believe that if the Controller had used the verbiage 'AFTER DEPARTURE' rather than 'AFTER TAKEOFF' we would not have misunderstood the clearance. In the future I will insist that if ALL THREE pilots are not positive of a clearance we will verify.		Contributing: Fatigue: I got mediocre sleep prior to this take off. This was the last day of a 6-day. It was my 9th day on the road. This trip was tougher than most. Two legs prior I departed the airport in similar weather conditions headed to the U.S. The leg prior I was in the U.S. for a departure during a snowstorm. We had what seemed like a loft that took about 90 minutes to get airborne, complete with deicing, runway closure, and almost exceeding our holdover time while dealing with a mechanical. That leg ended with a true CAT III landing in Europe complete with a low-vis taxi in. None of the three of us are sure of exactly what the Tower Controller said, but we all know that we heard the word 'take off', and we all believe that this is what made us think that we were cleared for take off. Instead, and given our position at the time, Tower could have said something more like 'you are cleared to line up and wait, but I have new departure instructions for you, after departure turn left 030' I believe that if he had used verbiage similar to this, this incident would not have occurred. For myself: when the Captain asked, 'are we cleared for takeoff?' I should have just keyed the mike and reconfirmed our clearance with the Tower. We've all heard the discussion about not taking each others' word for stuff like this inside the cockpit, and that the better solution is to query the Controller. Why I did not do this I have no idea, but I obviously should have. And had I, this incident would not have occurred and you would not be reading this report right now. All three of us: Captain could have said: 'confirm with Tower that we are cleared for take off' instead of asking me if we were cleared for takeoff. I could have asked Tower instead of just answering him, as described above. Others could have spoken up and said 'I'm not sure, let's ask' The bottom line is that any one of us could have easily prevented this incident, but none of us did.		Air Carrier departure from a foreign airport initiated a take off when reportedly ATC issued 'line up and wait' followed by 'after take off fly heading 030', which was interpreted as a take off clearance.

I complied with the ECAM while the First Officer continued to fly while assuming the duties of communicating with ATC. The ECAM directed me to turn off the Power Transfer Unit (PTU) and the Engine 1 Hydraulic Pump. The Green System hydraulic fluid quantity indicated almost empty. I sent a quick ACARS message to Dispatch stating we had a hydraulic problem, and directed him to call me with Maintenance Control on the line. They informed us to leave the Engine 1 Hydraulic Pump off for the remainder of the flight, prepare for a Gravity Gear Extension, and to keep our landing descent rate below 360 FPM. After checking all suitable airports for runways, NOTAMS, and weather trends Dispatch, the First Officer and I decided on the best airport for landing. I declared an Emergency with Center and we were given direct to [the divert airport]. After briefing the Lead Flight Attendant on our situation and explaining our problem to the passengers, The First Officer and I reviewed our game plan for the arrival. We complied with the Flight Manual's Landing Distance Corrections Procedures and Overweight Landing Checklists, and reviewed all of our inoperative systems prior to descent. After telling Center we would be flying an ILS Approach with an extended final I briefed the approach and became the flying pilot. Center and Approach Control were very accommodating. The First Officer performed the Gravity Gear Extension early with no problems, and the approach and landing were uneventful. After slowing to taxi speed I cleared the runway and stopped the aircraft. The Fire Department and Company Maintenance checked us over and we were eventually towed to the gate.				A320 Captain experiences loss of Green Hydraulic System fluid and pressure at FL320.

On page 6 of the Rejected Takeoff ECL, there is a table with brake temperatures and corresponding cooling times. These cooling times do not agree with the same table located in the flight manual Rejected Takeoff checklist. In the ECL, times are graduated in 10 minute intervals from 10-70 minutes for temperatures between 2.5 and 5.0 [degrees]. The corresponding times in the FM are all 10 minutes, regardless of temperature; an obvious error. I neglected to check the Annunciated Brake Temperature checklist in the ECL at the time, however I noted later that the corresponding FM checklist utilizes what seems to be the same erroneous brake temp/cooling time table as the FM Rejected Takeoff checklist. Both of these FM and ECL checklists refer the user to the performance chapter if the BTMS is inoperative. However, the brake cooling time table contains yet another table with both temperature values and cooling times that are different from both the ECL and the two FM non-normal checklists.				A B777 First Officer noted discrepancies between the electronic checklist (ECL) and two aircraft flight manual charts regarding rejected takeoff brake cooling times.

[We then] flew to the destination. Conferring with the First Officer, we both felt we were OK to fly back to our U.S. destination. Then, after brake release, we had problems with our clearance, loads, fog rolled in, ground operations came to a crawl, and planes backed up. By the time we took off, the sun was rising. We worked our way around weather in climb and initially en route. Once we were clear of all the challenges that kept us 'pumped up' fatigue slammed into us. I have flown this sequence 3 times previously in the last week, back to back, and I have three more, back to back. I knew fatigue was a factor under normal/adverse conditions. I should have called in fatigued when we got the turn to our destination from the divert station. I should have returned to the gate and called in fatigued when we were delayed on the ground.Honest reflection: I failed to project 'fatigue' factor. I knew from past flights fatigue would be a factor without throwing in a diversion. Though the First Officer and I felt we were fine at the gate, I failed to project the impact of fatigue. The First Officer had never been to this foreign airport and had never flown this sequence.Recommendation: 1) Emphasis projection of 'fatigue.' You may not 'feel that fatigued' at the gate, especially flying all night. 2) Eliminate this turn. Between the single runway operations, weather, holding, high altitude, 737 performance, flying all night with a 2 pilot crew, etc., 90% of the time it doesn't work as scheduled. It may be 'legal' on paper, but it isn't 'smart.'				A B737-800 Captain reported fatigue during a return flight from a foreign destination following a divert for weather, fog, clearance difficulties and weight and balance issues.

The First Officer noted that our calculated TOG was 148.0, and the takeoff performance FLEX limit weight was 147.5 at FLEX 63 degrees and flaps 1. The First Officer redid the performance weights via ACARS and new numbers indicated same FLEX temperature, but flaps 2. Together we noted the new speeds, inserted them into the FMGC, and then the First Officer continued the checklist until completion. By then we were cleared for takeoff so there was some urgency to finish the checklist. We took the runway and the takeoff roll and rotation was uneventful and normal. At acceleration altitude, as I anticipated a flaps 1 call, I noticed that there was no F speed index on the airspeed tape. We were already at flaps 1! The flaps never got reset to 2 when the new performance numbers were calculated. We took off at flaps 1 with flaps 2 speeds in the box! Rotation and initial climb was normal because the flaps 2 speeds were greater than the flaps 1 speeds. Flaps 1 V speeds were 138, 143, 143. Flaps 2 speeds were 143, 143, 145. The problem would have been if we had to execute a high speed abort, we could have aborted above the flaps 1 V1 with flaps 1 set. Contributing factors were; rushing to be ready for takeoff; not starting over the checklist after a configuration change; complacency. Fatigue was not really a factor for me in that I got sufficient rest. The First Officer indicated that fatigue was a possible factor.				A320 Captain reports requesting new weight and balance numbers during taxi out due to a gross weight increase. The new V speeds are entered in the FMGC but the flap setting is never changed from 1 to 2 as required by the new weight and balance. The error is not detected until flap retraction altitude.

We were switched to Approach and continued the descent when they advised that someone had a stuck MIC on frequency. At that time, we disconnected the flight interphone latch feature on both yokes and continued on to destination. We checked the operation of the switches on the ground and they seemed fine.I am concerned that this may be happening more than we realize since we have been using the flight interphone latch feature. I have been told by a number of other pilots that they will not use the feature due to the same type of problem where the latch feature of the MIC switch somehow crosses over and transmits on the normal microphone position even though both switches are latched in flight interphone position.		A B737-700 flight crew was advised of a stuck microphone on their frequency, but were unable to determine if they were the cause.

After delay vectors to allow for weather improvement, an initial attempt to execute an ILS to Runway 10 was made and abandoned, because of inadequate margins from rain showers to allow for a safe transition onto the localizer and glide path. During our attempt to intercept the ILS 10 final, course capture of the localizer and glide path were clearly going to occur inside the final approach fix without the proper electronic guidance for the transition. Absent adequate visual reference to request a 'visual approach,' the effort was abandoned in favor of ATC provided radar vectors to Runway 1 ILS for a normal approach and landing. Finally, had our approach to Runway 10 proceeded without incident, a landing would have been prevented due to developing tailwinds in the touchdown zone.				A320 Captain reports a go-around at MSY due to reported windshear from the preceding aircraft, and a second go-around due to tailwinds and an unstabilized approach. The third attempt is successful.

Essentially some of these requirements just created another 'to do' item in an already task-saturated environment, and an opportunity for Airbus crews to 'overlook' and not accomplish the item. A few of the fleet-instituted requirements did make good sense and enhance safety. The A320 FM dictates that 'If a runway change occurs after starting the Before Takeoff Checklist, repeat the checklist in its entirety.' This sounds good, but in fact can cause problems in the operation and hamper ATC. For example, a few weeks ago we were taxiing out for takeoff at SFO to Runway 28L. High winds had the airport landing and taking off on Runways 28[L and R]. We had 28L loaded in the FMGCs and had takeoff data for both 28L and R. We completed the Before Takeoff Checklist during taxi-out, and were holding short of 28L, ready for departure. Tower called and told us to 'Cross 28 left line-up and wait 28 right.' We quickly loaded 28R in the FMCs and scanned for traffic on final. We told Tower 'Cleared to cross 28 left but we will need a minute to run a checklist.' I further requested that we would like to hold short of 28R to accomplish this and not proceed on the runway. The Tower Controller was not happy! She then emphatically just said to hold short of 28L now and expect departure from 28L. I have counted now SIX TIMES this has happened to me at SFO on the 28's. Each time I have asked the First Officer to have both sets of data available and ready with the same flap setting. Usually the data are almost identical. However, the Controllers clear aircraft for takeoff on either 28 left or right, depending on arrivals. We never know what runway it will be. SFO Tower even broadcasts now for crews to have runway data for both runways, but that doesn't help us our with our FM requirement.Re-running a 15+ step checklist quickly but accurately takes time. Re-running it near runway thresholds with eyes inside the cockpit has adverse safety implications for our flight operation. A better way would be to perhaps put asterisks (*) at the steps that really do need to be re-checked on the Before Takeoff Checklist. Line crews on the Airbus fleet are now very familiar with the scratch-pad message to re-check V-speeds. The current requirement now detracts from our margin of safety rather than enhancing it.				A320 Captain believes the company requirement to run the takeoff checklist in its' entirety after a runway change is too time consuming and causes problems with ATC.  The reporter offers suggestions.

Taxiing out, we were cleared via taxiways EE-M-T-BB, hold short of AA. Once cleared onto Runway 10 from BB, there is approximately 7,800 FT remaining for takeoff, NOT the stated 8,947 FT. This occurs at the point on the runway just west of where taxiway AA intersects the runway. The problem is that Ground Control brings you up Taxiway BB, and there is no way to back taxi as the runway is only 148 FT wide, and the B777 needs at least 156 FT. If you take Taxiway AA, there is at least a 150 degree turn to get lined up with Runway 10, which might mean dragging a wheel in the dirt, or taking out a runway light. It is very poorly lit by the runway. There is no information as to where the takeoff performance data is predicated on the runway. It does not say whether or not this is from AA or BB, the only two taxiways to get you to the takeoff area of the runway. We elected to change from a reduced thrust to maximum takeoff thrust to ensure a greater margin of safety. The takeoff was uneventful and we were airborne with 1,500-2,000 FT remaining. There are two issues we found. One, there is no information stating where the shortened Runway 10 performance data is predicated. Two, there is no information in the airplane manual on takeoff distance required, which is very important, in my opinion, since that would provide a great backup to a NOTAMed change of runway length and subsequent operations.				A B777, planning to depart SBGL Runway 10 from Taxiway AA utilized maximum thrust because they were unable to determine the point on the runway from which performance data for a reduced thrust takeoff was predicated.

I received the HF assignments. I also received the HF assignment for the section of WATRS north of Bermuda. I then got the SELCAL check on HF. When the First Officer came back from his break I briefed the required items along with the frequencies and their location on my flight progress sheet on the clipboard. When I came back from break, three hours later, I noticed we were still on HF just north of MARIG Intersection which is the exit point for WATRS. I questioned why we hadn't received the VHF assignment via CPLDC. The First Officer and Relief Pilot said that we hadn't received it through CPDLC. I tried to send a message through a CPDLC free text message. I was unable to send it because we weren't logged on. The Relief Pilot then questioned if we had to log on again re-entering WATRS at BOVIC. It turns out that they had not logged on again north of Bermuda. By the frequencies in the number 1 HF, it appeared that they had talked to NY Radio and gotten a SELCAL check when they entered WATRS. I Called NY Radio on VHF to get a NY Center frequency just as another flight was calling us on 121.5 with the frequency for us. Part of my briefing will be the requirement to re-log on to KZWY CPDLC after transiting Bermuda airspace.		As First Officer (pilot flying) northbound, I returned from my break and resumed my duties as pilot flying after receiving the brief from the Captain on radio frequencies and communication. The Relief Pilot (pilot not flying) contacted New York on VHF frequency prior to entering BDA TMA. Prior to BOVIC the Relief Pilot contacted NY on HF and received a SELCAL check and advised NY that we were CPDLC equipped. The FMC showed that the BOVIC position report had been sent. Prior to MARIG the Captain returned from his break and resumed his duties as pilot not flying. He inquired if we had received our VHF frequency for New York. We had not received the frequency. He tried to send a message via CPDLC and we realized that we were not logged on. He made contact with New York using a charted frequency. Contact was made at the same time that another flight was attempting to pass us the frequency on radio #2. As pilot flying I will ensure in the future that anytime a SELCAL check is made and we are logging onto CPDLC that I double check that we are in fact logged onto CPDLC.		B777 flight crew reports not receiving a VHF frequency for ZNY via CPDLC prior to departing the WATRS area northbound.

Worried that the window was going to completely blow out, we donned our O2 masks and ran the Emergency Descent Checklist. We decided to divert to [a nearby airport] and declared an emergency. ATC cleared us to 11,000 FT with vectors to [our new destination]. Once the Emergency Descent Checklist was completed, we ran the Cracked Window Checklist. The Flight Attendants were notified of the situation. We had a cockpit jumpseater who assisted with checklist items and landing data computations. This was simply a mechanical problem. I think that all parties involved handled the situation very well. The outcome was good and I can't think of anything that should have been done differently.				A B737-700 First Officer reported a cockpit window shattered at FL390. An emergency was declared and the flight diverted to a nearby airport.

I could tell the Captain was having some trouble with the shear/turbulence as the aircraft began climbing again and our heading was drifting right instead of left. We then reached an altitude of 4,000 MSL. I tried to offer as much assistance I could without distracting the Captain further. ATC inquired about our altitude and I explained our situation and told him we were trying to descend and turn but had hit turbulence. During this time we over-sped the flaps twice by 10 KTS. We returned to our assigned heading and altitude and landed uneventfully. The flaps were written up and cleared by Maintenance.		An A320 reported overspeeding the flaps on a go-around event at LGA triggered by turbulence that may have been a result of close spacing.

Crossfeed Valve Circuit Breaker found to be open. Fuel was successfully balanced but rapidly went out of balance when all main tank pumps restored.

We tried to work on it. We phone-patched Dispatch and Maintenance to help solve the problem. I asked Maintenance if the aircraft had a history of imbalance. I couldn't find anything in the log history. I asked the question, because I had flown an aircraft before, with that problem. We said that it wasn't. After much discussion, we all decided to return to the departure airport as the best option. On returning it was noticed that the crossfeed was open. None of us had touched them. There had been maintenance work going in the cockpit before start for another problem. A number of switches were being activated during the fix. During the before checklist, the fuel panel check was overrode. The aircraft turns off a center pump for load shedding and we all saw that and thought that was the problem. Never seeing the cross feeds open, we closed the crossfeed and the imbalance stopped. It was too late in the flight to turn back and head to our filed destination.		About 3 hours out from departure we noticed a fuel imbalance developing on the center EICAS. Ran the fuel imbalance checklist to try and identify the problem and seek a remedy. The first part of it did not point to a fuel leak and we were hesitant to run the cross feeding part of the checklist due to the Captain's concern about dumping more fuel overboard if indeed a fuel leak existed. It is then we got Dispatch and Maintenance on the SATCOM radio and came up with the plan to return to the departure airport rather than make the Atlantic crossing. Shortly thereafter our Relief Pilot who had recently returned from his rest period noticed the crossfeed valves were both open and had been, knowing what we know now since we walked on the airplane at the gate. On our before start checklist, the checklist override was selected by me on command by the Captain as the only amber light visible was the shed fuel pump light which is normal. We failed to identify that the XFEED were open. I realize now if I had run that second part of the fuel imbalance checklist, and I mentioned it at least twice to the Captain that that was what was left on our fuel imbalance checklist, which involved cross feeding to remedy the imbalance we would have noticed early enough the problem to avoid the diversion.		A B777 developed an apparent fuel imbalance in flight but since troubleshooting did not reveal a problem, the crew returned to the departure airport where enroute they found the fuel crossfeed valves unexpectedly open.

I was on autopilot and monitoring through the HUD. We had glideslope capture and LOC captured in the MCP panel so I set zero in the altitude window. As we passed the marker, I picked up the buildings of surrounding city and then XX. As I was about to call the runway in sight, we got an obstacle call from the GPWS. We were visual, and I had the buildings in sight, but I unhooked the autopilot and added thrust and started a slight climb. I verbally wondered aloud to my First Officer if this maybe a false alert, but he said that as soon as we got the alert, he looked up and I was 1 to 1 1/2 dots low on the glideslope. As we continued visually to the airport, I looked down and saw that my NAV radio was not tuned to the ILS of XX. I am not sure how it was changed, or when, but because it had changed, we were in a continual descent and not on the glideslope as we should have been. I think that we were on the correct path because of the descent rate that had been established, but when we both transitioned to visual, my First Officer didn't notice we were going below the glideslope. I didn't notice the change in the MCP Panel until we got the obstacle call. We should both be more aware of what is selected in the MCP panel, and should both be monitoring the performance of the aircraft a little better. We should have had better communication about who would look for the airport and who would monitor the instruments and for how long after we got to visual calls.				A B737 Captain on a HUD ILS approach got an EGPWS warning and discovered that the ILS frequency had somehow been changed and the aircraft was in a constant descent with zero in the altitude alert window.

The Captain (pilot not flying) missed/provided incorrect setting during the descent checklist; and the pilot flying also did not double check to ensure the correct altimeter was set. In addition, during altitude changes assigned by ATC, the Captain set the altitude and pulled or pushed to initiate the descent without the concurrence or verification (finger pointing to the correct altitude) of the pilot flying. As a result of the incorrect altimeter setting in the FCU, several altitudes on the arrival were crossed below the minimum altitude restrictions. Probably the most notable human factor was the constant and continuous talking from the Captain during the descent phase which may have been a contributing factor to missing the correct altimeter setting.		During the arrival, the altimeters were set incorrectly. They were supposed to be set to 29.92, but were incorrectly set to 30.45. We missed the arrival altitudes by the corresponding amounts. We were asked by SOCAL Approach to say our altitude at the bottom of our descent to 5,000 FT, but weren't given a corrected altimeter by SOCAL. We were given a visual approach with a crossing restriction, and visually noticed we were low on the Localizer 27 approach. The error was discovered and addressed on visual final approach. A debrief of the event was conducted, and during it, we discovered a few of the errors that were made. ATIS was pulled during the enroute letdown, and I noticed it was 29.92, and made a mental note that there would be no actual change in altimeter as STD is set above 18,000. During the checklist, we were given a change in clearance to descend via the LYNDI arrival, just as the descent checklist was being completed, so we had new ATIS, new descent instructions being accomplished during checklist. The key error was the crosscheck, where I picked up the ATIS, thinking it was the one just off the printer, and read it, and set it, and reminded myself there was no altimeter change. Unfortunately, it was the departure ATIS from the trash pile. The checklist was completed, and probably the long day prevented the nagging feeling of a mistake, or the ignoring of the clues from SOCAL TRACON. Fortunately, we were in visual conditions, and were able to notice the abnormalities in the approach and correct them. I believe the 2,500 foot call, was the beginning of catching the error, although it was actually addressed a bit lower. Unfortunately, two tired pilots made some sloppy errors, and broke some habit patterns, then failed in the first few of the feedback loops. A final crosscheck, and good situational awareness, when it counted, kept this problem within the constraints of this report.		A320 flight crew reports missetting the altimeters descending through FL180, resulting in the aircraft being at least 400 FT low during all phases of the arrival and initial approach. The error is detected and corrected once established on the LOC.

As we were approaching 140 west, the ride was getting worse. We had already requested, and flew, in a block altitude from FL350 to FL370 in order to accommodate a better ride for our customers. We had been flying at FL360, but returned to FL350 because the ride seemed to be better lower. We noticed on the TCAS ahead and below us at FL310 an aircraft over 140 west. We queried the aircraft about their ride. They told us their ride was pretty decent at FL310. We had sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to run the fuel numbers for a flight at FL310 to see if that was an option, and gave our Dispatcher notice of what we were contemplating. By 140 west, our current flight plan dictated a step climb to FL370, but based on the current conditions this was not a viable option. The fasten seat belt sign was on. I requested a discreet HF frequency and a patch to Dispatch because I had not received an answer for a flight plan burn at FL310. We were told to contact them on different frequency and to standby for the patch. About 20 to 15 nautical miles from 140 west the ride deteriorated further, and we experienced a large variance in indicated airspeed, and large changes in attitudes. Realizing that the ride kept getting worse, I elected to use my Captain's emergency authority and told the First Officer to descend before we did some serious damage to the aircraft. We remained on assigned frequency and advised that we had encountered severe turbulence and were descending to FL320. To add to the workload that was before us, we had to make sure our course and distance for our next leg was correct, and had to get ready to mark our position as we crossed 140 west and write the parameters on the flight plan. I made sure the TCAS switch was selected to 'BELOW' to make sure no conflict traffic laid ahead. The workload jumped exponentially from one second to another. The First Officer called the flight attendants to make sure no one had been hurt and everybody remained belted. We encountered this polar jet stream and area of light turbulence that was shown on the prognostic chart, prior to the location on the chart. According to the chart, the light turbulence area and jet stream were still further to the east of us. Company traffic ahead of us had provided a pilot report saying the ride was decent at FL370. Our optimal altitude from the FMC still did not provide FL370 as an option; therefore, we were left with the options of staying at FL350 or going lower. We were well aware of the weather system ahead of us and had discussed the options. What the prognostic chart did not show, was the turbulence was greater than light! With the prognostic chart and company aircraft to back up the ride reports we were mislead. No one could have predicted this based on the information at hand. Based on how fast this event developed, and how fast we got our new clearance, I believe we did due diligence on our part. At no time was the safety of our passengers compromised by a potential collision with another aircraft. I believe that if Satcom would have been available, the decision to go to a lower altitude would have been made earlier, and this situation could have been avoided. 'NO COMM' on the ACARS delayed messages sent from Dispatch and us. Having a direct communication Dispatch link would have been a great help. Also, the ability to talk to Commercial Radio that evening was degraded due to the heavy volume of communication taking place on HF.		Nearing 140 west, our aircraft encountered unforecasted/unreported severe turbulence. As we were coordinating with ATC, the airspeed and altitude fluctuations grew to an unacceptable level with respect to the safe operation of the aircraft. At this time, the Captain (pilot not flying) made the decision to descend out of the turbulence in the interest of safety. Shortly thereafter, clearance was received from ATC for our descent. As our preflight winds and turbulence plots had indicated the possibility of turbulence in this area, we had made the decision to sit the passengers and flight attendants down prior to this encounter, which undoubtedly warded off any injuries. Our crew had requested PIREP's from other aircraft operating on the same route (both company and other) at the same altitude, but no other aircraft had experienced any turbulence in excess of occasional moderate turbulence. Making matters worse, the event happened coincident with a compulsory reporting point which was also a course change. Handling the turbulence, communications, and navigation was a chore but other than the altitude deviation, no other errors were noted. Although we had made many requests to Dispatch through ACARS prior to the event regarding weather on our route and fuel calculations should we need to descend, no replies were received. For the majority of our flight, ACARS showed 'No Comm' although there were no system faults with the HF radios. Although this event would have been difficult to predict by Dispatch, a more reliable system for transmission of data would have helped forewarn company aircraft following in our path. Instead, warning the company aircraft following behind us by approximately 30 minutes became our task, only adding to the workload on the flight deck.[We had] a rapid onset of severe turbulence at our flight level, which was not experienced by aircraft passing through the same region ahead of us and avoided by trailing aircraft due to our PIREP's was the cause. Weather predictions obtained prior to flight and PIREP's from preceding aircraft also failed to predict this episode.		During a Pacific crossing a flight crew reports encountering unforecasted severe turbulence and descends to a lower altitude using Captain's emergency authority prior to receiving ATC clearance via HF radio.

This occurred with a corresponding uncommanded system test of the windshear alerting system. He said that they went ahead and landed because they determined there was a malfunction of some kind, which caused the system to begin a test. They were called by a Company representative who asked why they didn't go around and they explained the malfunction. The Company representative was satisfied they had done the correct thing. Well, fast forward to yesterday. The same thing happened to us with the system going into the test mode and giving us the aural, 'Go Around, Windshear Ahead' alert. I don't know what is causing this, but we need to find out for two reasons. First, we need to preclude possible unnecessary missed approaches. Second, we need to prevent negative learning in that we are supposed to go around when we get a warning. Find out what is causing this and either fix the problem or at least alert crew to the possibility of the system going into the test mode and giving an invalid warning.	The reporter stated that the EGPWS windshear warning test mode activates only on BOS Runway 27. The anomaly's cause is unknown, but windmills near the runway may be a factor.	On the prior approach, winds were calm with clear skies. There were no convective activity or windshear advisories on the ATIS. The radar was off. Approximately 200 FT AGL, we got the same indications as the previous flight: audio warning and the radar test display. I asked the Captain about continuing and he said to land. The radar test display stayed up until after landing and we selected terrain for the ND display on taxi in. Obviously there is something about this runway that is causing erroneous windshear warnings. There appears to be a power plant or radar site under short final that may be the source of erroneous signals. There are also some windmills in the vicinity.		A B737 NG flight crew reported a false EGPWS predictive windshear warning on short final to BOS Runway 27.

The crossfeed valve transition light never came on but the valve worked. When we closed the crossfeed valve the transition light again didn't work. As time went on the fuel all fed out of the left side. We balanced the fuel but when we went to tank to engine feed again it was coming out of left main again. We called Maintenance and with them verified the crossfeed valve circuit breaker was popped out. Seemed like crossfeed valve was stuck open and feed was out of left tank. We decided to divert to an enroute airport. We balanced the fuel between the left and right tanks on the way and landed balanced. We declared an emergency to get priority handling. Maintenance suspected a crossfeed valve actuator and was going to replace that. We took the plane out the next day. No way to avoid event. Just monitoring the systems prevented anything from really happening.				A B737-800 crossfeed valve failed in the open position causing fuel to feed only from the left tank when tank to engine was selected so an emergency was declared and the flight diverted to an enroute airport.

I had just completed a Simulator Check with auto throttles inoperative and knew it would be a very busy leg even with good weather. Captain had never flown 737 without auto throttles in either simulation or on line. We reviewed MEL and thoroughly discussed all aspects/phases of the flight. A 737 Captain was in the jump seat for the leg. Cruise altitude was FL390. Completely unrelated to the airspeed event described below, upon leveling at FL390 in smooth air, we noted that we had about ten knots below the red line and ten knots above the yellow hook. It occurred to us, that without the added protection afforded with auto throttles, that any unexpected turbulence could easily result in an over speed or under speed and/or departure from controlled flight. We requested a descent to FL370 which made for a much more comfortable margin. Prior to the descent, the Captain determined that the HUD was extremely helpful in power management and determined it best that he fly the descent, approach and landing. I then became pilot not flying. Upon arrival approach left us at 4,000 FT just outside FAF about 10 miles from the field. We requested a vector for descent and received clearance to descend to 2,000 FT on a 340 degree (approximate) heading, across the final approach course. Flaps 10 was selected for the descent. At that point I suggested to the Captain that if Approach tried to give us a right turn to final that we request a left 270 as a right turn to final would have set us up for an angling, unstable approach. Approach did clear us for the right turn and we requested a 270 to final which clearly irritated the Approach Controller. During the turn, the Captain came off the HUD momentarily to clear the turn as I worked the radios and checklist. About 10-15 degrees into the turn both the jumpseater and I simultaneously noted the airspeed bleeding off and below the target MCP speed (175 KTS) and the ten flap bug speed (approximately 170). We both called 'airspeed' immediately and noted it at 165 KTS, which was about ten knots above the min man (hook speed). Captain immediately added power and speed quickly returned to MCP target speed (175 KTS). Visual approach concluded with no further issues. We discussed this at length and noted that we had a lot going for us. Good weather, daylight, non-fatigued, observant jumpseater. Cockpit was completely sterile and we had thoroughly briefed approach, to include the possibility of a no auto throttles go round. We were alert for, and proactive for the possibility of an unstable approach. After landing, we did the 'what ifs': What if we were at the end of a long day, night, marginal weather, no jumpseater, challenging high altitude airport, language barriers, and/or another minor aircraft issue. The potential for an unhappy outcome is obvious. Our conclusions are that: 1. We should not dispatch aircraft without auto throttles, or if absolutely necessary, for one leg only for the repair. 2. If aircraft are dispatched without auto throttles, the MEL should specify certain limits on length of leg, weather, type of approaches (ie. not CAT II/III) and should have dispatch altitude limits to increase the performance margins for unanticipated turbulence. Consideration should be given to not dispatching into airports in known high workload environment/hit list airports. 3. We get very little training or guidance in flying the 737 without auto throttles. If dispatching without auto throttles is to be allowed, we need Operations Manual guidance that helps us consider where we can be tripped up on the various phases of flight.				A B737 First Officer reported being dispatched with an inoperative auto throttle system and described the situations that developed. It was suggested that this MEL should have restrictions or simulator training for this situation be enhanced.

ATC cleared us to descend via the BASET 3 Arrival and expect ILS 7R, we had briefed and programmed ILS 6L in FMS. I was pilot flying and dialed in 10,000 FT in the altitude window and pushed altitude, and then changed the runway to 7R in FMS. We were briefing the new runway when ATC said to maintain 14,000 FT as we missed our crossing restriction at TRTLE and he said he didn't want us to go below his airspace. We were at 14,500 FT at that time. No other aircraft were within 15 miles of us. We continued our descent to 14,000 FT and that was the end of the altitude deviation. I think the crossing restriction dropped out when I changed runways or went into open descent when the new runway was inserted and I didn't notice it. Then we were briefing the new approach we had just been assigned when we flew through the altitude. Task saturation and unfamiliarity with landing on the 6's and 7's in LAX as we almost always land on 24's and 25's contributed to this deviation.		While descending into LAX airport we were switched to the Baset 3 arrival for 07R instead the Seaview 2 arrival as per our flight plan, a clearance to cross KONZL at FL170 was also issued which we complied with uneventfully. After passing KONZL at FL170 we were cleared to descend via the Baset 3 arrival but another runway change was issued for 06L at the same time. We switched the arrival in the MCDU and commenced our descent as per the arrival. After switching the runways we reviewed the altitude/speed restrictions and briefed the new approach, but the TRTLE restriction to cross at 16,000 got deleted and there are only 6 miles from KONZL to TRTLE and the descent already started, we were busy re-briefing and rechecking the restrictions and the Aircraft descended to 14,700 FT, the ATC Controller told us to level off at 14,000 to remain in his airspace, that we missed the restriction. The ND and MCDU did not show the restriction, it was deleted during the change. There was no loss of separation with other traffic and we proceeded to LAX without any further comment from ATC.The event occurred due to several factors: 1) Several arrival and runway assignment changes during the busy phase of descent. 2) Software feature on MCDU sometimes drops altitude and speed restrictions form certain fixes when runway or arrival is changed in the MCDU. Sometimes the arrival is selected and all the altitude/speed restrictions are missing and have to be manually entered. 3) We were distracted by the change of arrivals and runways and all the tasks that came along with that, like reprogramming and re-briefing the new procedure. 4) Time constraints were also an issue since we wanted to get the change done properly and promptly to review the restrictions since we were already on the descent phase, and TRTLE was very close to KONZL (only 6 miles away)1) Correct the MCDU software to avoid dropping altitude and speed restrictions when the present procedure is changed. Maybe develop a warning message to make pilots aware. 2) Make ATC aware on how these many runway and arrival changes impact our operational safety, especially when issued during high workload phases like descent. These changes are very common in LAX but they are usually given earlier with more time to prepare, at a phase were pilots are not that busy. 3) Pilots should delay all briefings and supplemental duties until all the restrictions are verified are correct and the aircraft is a position to meet them safely.		A320 flight crew reports missing the crossing restriction at TRTLE during descent on the BASET 3 to LAX. The aircraft went into open descent while entering an ATC assigned runway change into the FMGC and was not detected by the flight crew.

It had been a short flight to that lasted 1 hour 23 minutes at 32,000 FT. Ambient temperature on the ground was 61F and fuel tank temperature was slightly above 0C. We boarded 30,000 LBS of fuel for our departure. The non-revving pilot told me what he witnessed and went on to say that he believed it to have been liquid condensation until we became airborne and the liquid did not run off.Not much more could have been done to prevent this incident. All Company procedures were complied with. Maybe Boeing, in conjunction with the FAA, needs to come up with some operational relief for CSFF. Obviously, there are scenarios where current procedures and detection methods cannot guarantee that CSFF has been mitigated.				A B737-700 flight crew took off with cold soaked fuel frost (CSFF) adhering to the top surface of the wing. The frost was not visible during a preflight inspection which occurred prior to boarding fuel for the subsequent flight.

About 60 degrees into the turn, I noticed on the PFD that would be a conflict with traffic on approach to Runway 31C.  I told the First Officer to stop the turn and was told at that moment by ATC that it was a right turn to heading 110.		On the last leg of a long trip we were departing 22L in MDW.  We were cleared into position and told to be ready due to an aircraft on short final.  A few seconds later, as the takeoff clearance was being received, I began pushing the power up.  The arriving aircraft was 1.5 miles out. I did not hear the turn instruction nor see the Captain spin the heading.  On climbout, I saw the heading bug set to 110 and asked if we were given a turn.  The Captain said yes, I called heading select, and followed the guidance in a left turn.  At approximately 140 degrees, the Captain said stop the turn and then said turn right to 110. I had started the turn to the right when ATC said we should be turning right to 110.  We were then handed off to departure and ATC said nothing further.The Captain stated that he had read back 'left turn 110' as we began our roll and was never corrected.  He tried to query ATC just after takeoff, but the frequency was jammed.  The first night of the trip we had departed 22L on the way to CMSKY so a left turn didn't feel wrong, though I am quite used to the long right turn to 110 or 90 when going east.		A B-737NG Flight Crew turned the wrong way when MDW Tower's takeoff clearance included an over 180 degree right turn when able.

My First Officer replied he was in sight and we were instructed to maintain visual separation. About seven miles from the threshold of 8L we were instructed to turn to a 180 heading as well as maintain a speed of 180 KTS. Soon after we complied, I realized we were approaching the centerline of 8L without receiving a clearance to turn and intercept the final approach course. I asked my First Officer to query Approach Control for a clearance which he did twice without a response.Soon we were passing through the north runway approach courses and did not want to cause any loss of separation with other arriving aircraft. I then turned back towards 8L after clearing the area visually as well as checking TCAS. My First Officer was finally able to contact Atlanta Tower and we were cleared to land on 9R. After we landed, taxied in and parked at our gate I asked my First Officer what had happened and why we had lost communication with Approach Control. He told me he must have selected his audio control panel to VHF 1 accidentally. When he did this during our base leg, he put our Company and Ramp frequency in comm 1 instead of comm 2 which was his original intent. This was the cause of our loss of communication which resulted in our deviation.After analyzing all of the events which resulted in the deviation, I should have realized the loss of communication and reacted sooner than I did. I also know if that you lose communication, check to make sure each pilot's ACP [Audio Control Panel] is set properly and the correct frequency is entered. First and foremost, fly the aircraft and do not wait for instructions if you feel something is out of the ordinary.		While on a heading of 180 and getting closer to our final course, I contacted ATC and requested a heading to intercept the localizer for 8L. After not getting a response, I checked the frequency on VHF 1 and realized that it was not the correct one; both frequencies on VHF 1 active and standby indicators corresponded to Company and Ramp Control respectively, the same frequencies that were preselected on VHF 2. Since I could not remember the last assigned frequency for Approach Control, I tuned the 8L Tower frequency. We contacted Tower and advised our situation, Tower immediately gave us a clearance for a visual approach to 9R, and changed us to 9R frequency. Analyzing the problem I can conclude that while on a 180 heading, I remember preselecting the ramp frequency on Comm Two standby indicator, and then pressing the transfer switch without realizing that the tuning switch for VHF 1 on Comm Two had been selected and was active. In other words, any frequency change on Comm Two was also changing frequencies on Comm One. I suspect that the VHF 1 tuning switch on communication box #2 was inadvertently selected during the flight. Maybe they should be deactivated so each box is tuned independently to prevent this error from happening again.		While being vectored for a visual approach to Runway 8L at ATL the flight crew of a B737-700 inadvertently deselected ATC on their audio selector panels. Upon recognizing the loss the Captain turned toward the airport--away from traffic--while the First Officer tuned the Tower frequency. The Local Controller promptly changed their runway and sent them to the appropriate Tower frequency.

TCAS RA at FL400 we had a sudden TCAS RA showing traffic on the nose less than 1 mile and same altitude. We immediately responded per the operations manual and hand flew the aircraft in a climb. The target aircraft stayed at our altitude the entire time as we climbed +700 FT and notified ATC. The Controller stated that no other aircraft were in that airspace and he noted our RA climb. We then selected the TA only mode on the transponder and returned to assigned altitude. When we turned the transponder to TA only, both ND on Captain's and First Officer's maps went blank. Both faults were written up in the logbook. Since no traffic separation was noted by ATC, we did not believe a [incident report] was required, however both the map blanking and the TCAS malfunction were noted in the maintenance log.				A B737-800 had an apparent TCAS Null Bus failure which caused them to take evasive action from a target at FL400 less than a mile from their aircraft. ATC reported no other traffic in the area.

First Officer completed the ECAM items and we reviewed the Flight Manual for any additional considerations. While the First Officer monitored the airplane and ATC, I established a phone patch with Dispatch. We informed them of the issue and advised that we would need a tow-in from the runway. I then briefed the flight attendants on the interphone of the situation and emphasized that cabin prep would not be required. After informing the passengers of the issue and assuring them of a normal landing, the First Officer and I had time to discuss all the aspects of the approach and landing. When we switched to Approach, we declared an emergency and advised that we would need the tow-in and would most likely be stopping on the runway. The weather was VFR and we completed the visual approach with no complications.The landing gear was extended using the Manual Gear Extension procedure with no problems although the gear doors remained open and increased the noise levels in both the cockpit and First Class. As we approached taxi speed on the rollout, I felt I had sufficient control to safely exit on the high speed turnoff. We stopped between the runways and shut down to await the tow-in. The airport authority safety personnel arrived with our Maintenance crew and would not allow us to cross the runway until the hydraulic leak was stopped. That took about 10 minutes after the reservoir was depressurized. The tow-in was completed without incident. First Officer was extremely helpful and efficient in providing input and suggestions and proved to be an invaluable resource through out the incident; his calm professionalism and ability to anticipate what was needed, made handling this event easy. He is one of the finest First Officers I have flown with in my 12 years as Captain.		[Narrative 2 had no additional information.]		An A320 flight crew received an ECAM message HYD G RES LOW LEVEL.

Afterwards, we briefly discussed the procedure for 'Stabilizer Trim Inoperative' just in case we had a complete stabilizer trim failure. The electric trim was working with the autopilot off, however, intermittently. Shortly later, I discovered the electric trim had failed completely. At this time, the Captain took control to try his electric trim with no success and then we decided to declare an emergency. From this point on, I was the pilot monitoring. We completed the 'Stabilizer Trim Inoperative' procedure in the QRH and proceeded to the final approach fix for the [ILS approach]. The Captain flew the aircraft and I controlled the trim manually based on his commands. The Captain briefed the flight attendants and the passengers. The rest of the flight was completed without incident. We landed and then proceeded to check the aircraft for any other problems. None were found, so the Captain terminated the emergency and we taxied to the gate.		The electric trim failed completely. I immediately took control of the aircraft to check electric trim operation from my yoke and found that it was the same -- inoperative. I then declared an emergency and, exercising Captain's emergency authority, immediately proceeded direct to the final approach fix and began a gradual descent to 6,000 feet. We then accomplished the 'Stabilizer Trim Inoperative' QRH procedure. Manual trim worked. Our plan was to fly the ILS Rwy 28 approach at ORD using Flaps 15 per QRH procedure, exit the runway, stop the aircraft and do a quick check of systems and allow emergency personnel to check over our aircraft to be sure all was well. At that point, our plan was to terminate the emergency and taxi to the gate, with emergency vehicles following me as a courtesy. I informed ATC of this plan, so everyone was on the same page, and then requested emergency vehicles and a single frequency approach. I also informed ATC that we would be slowing early, intercepting the ILS glide slope from 6,000 feet, and following the glide slope from then on, which might entail non-compliance with some of the step-down altitudes on the approach. I then directed my F/O to accomplish all normal checklist procedures as early as possible, so that he could devote his full attention to monitoring aircraft control and to manual trim during the approach and landing. I very gradually slowed the aircraft early, and configured early, to allow us plenty of time for manual trim and a stable approach.		B737-800 flight crew reported failure of electric stabilizer trim.  An emergency was declared and an ILS approach flown, with the F/O controlling the trim manually based on the Captain's commands.

I couldn't tell where it was coming from and mostly forgot about it. While taxiing out for takeoff, I noticed the light again and saw it was coming from a cargo operator's ramp. They had one of those temporary construction type generator light tower units. It had four light fixtures on top of the tower and was pointed and angled right at the displaced threshold of 30R. Multiple trucks were under it and it looked like they had a temporary sort operation going on in the ramp area. On the takeoff roll, the light was very distracting and bright. It affected my vision for several minutes after takeoff. This cargo operator could easily point the light in a direction away from the runway.	No new information was provided except to add that it appeared to be a temporary set up to sort packages for the holidays. The Tower was not informed of the lighting situation unfortunately.

The ECAM called for cycling the flap handle in an attempt to reset the system so we asked for and received increased assigned speed from ATC. It became apparent that we would need to break off the approach and work the problem. We did this. I assigned the First Officer to fly and work the radios while I worked the problem. I followed the ECAM and retracted the flaps. On re-extension the problem recurred. I used the irregular section of the Flight Manual which directed a Flap 3 handle position for landing and review of Maneuvers section Abnormal Slat/Flap Approach. Additionally we were to apply landing distance calculation procedure. I determined that we had more than adequate available landing distance with 16R, weather was not a factor and we had about one hour of fuel remaining. I spoke to the purser and told her what the problem was and that we would need another 15 minutes or so to complete checklists. I also said we did not need to prepare for an evacuation. I made a PA announcement to inform the passengers of our problem and that they could expect a normal landing after our checklists were complete.   We reviewed our problem with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and determined there was no fix we could attempt. During this time the First Officer suggested declaring an emergency. I agreed, and we did so. The First Officer and I briefed each other on what each had been doing and we then got clearance back to the airport. I took back the airplane on final approach and an uneventful landing followed.		I was flying the approach at 9,000 FT MSL and 210 KIAS with flaps 1 selected. ATC cleared us for the visual approach. ATC said to slow to 170 KIAS. I selected 170 KIAS, disconnected the autopilot and at 190 KIAS requested flaps 2. Flaps 2 was selected which resulted in the F/CTL Flaps Fault ECAM. At this point we were in a slight descent as we were capturing the glide slope. I continued to fly the airplane as the Captain began to execute the ECAM. As we needed to cycle the flaps we told Tower that we needed to break off the approach. We climbed back to 9,000 FT MSL and were given a turn towards the north. The Captain selected 200 KIAS and cycled the flaps with the same result - the ECAM returned. At this point my attention was solely on flying the airplane, talking with ATC and keeping the Captain apprised of our fuel state while he worked the problem. While working through the problem the flaps were cycled twice to no avail. About this time I told ATC that we were declaring an emergency and provided them with fuel and souls on board. I also requested the longest runway and explained our problem and that we would be landing at a much higher speed then normal. I also said that we would probably have no problem clearing the runway after landing. After approximately 15 minutes the Captain briefed me on the approach and landing that we would need to perform as he had reviewed the abnormal checklist for Flap Fault, the Maneuvers section of the Flight Manual for the approach profile and flap and speed settings and had calculated the runway required for the speed and configuration flown. As we had the fuel for a little more flight time the Captain contacted [Maintenance] to see if they had any additional help to provide. I pointed out that we were at 4,200 LBS of fuel and 45 miles from the airport at which time we decided that at 4,000 LBS we would fly the approach. I told ATC that we were ready for the approach, they gave us a heading of 140 to intercept the LOC and I turned control over to the Captain who flew the approach and landing. Auto brakes Medium were selected flaps 3 selected on the Performance page and a reference speed of 157 entered. The approach looked fairly normal with the touchdown about the 2,000 FT marker with a normal roll out. As we taxied to gate we left the flap handle in the flap 3 detent for maintenance. I also made a PA reminding everyone to remain seated until at the gate.		Following receipt of a F/CTL flap fault ECAM, an A320 flight crew executed a go around, performed appropriate checklists and notifications, declared an emergency and landed without incident.

It was dark outside and the radio was pretty quiet with very sporadic transmissions. As we approached FLL we checked in with Miami Center and they acknowledged us checking in at FL350. Approximately 230 miles from FLL while at FL350 we got a call from Miami Center asking us to descend to FL200. I answered the call with 'Descend and maintain Flight level Two Zero Zero, Air Carrier XXX' The First Officer, who was the flying pilot, set 20,000 in the ALT window and started a gradual descent. At the time I thought we were still a little too far from FLL to start our descent but because of traffic going into Miami I have had them issue this early descent in the past so I thought nothing of it. As we descended through FL260 Miami Center issues a clearance for us to descend at pilot's discretion to FL240. I tried to figure out what was going on and after a few seconds the Miami Center Controller re-issued the clearance for us to descend at pilot's discretion to FL240. I answered the Controller by saying that I was trying to figure out the last clearance that had already been issued us a previous clearance for us to descend and maintain FL200. The Controller then informed me that they were manning two frequencies and that there was another aircraft with a similar callsign and same XXX flight number on the Controller's other frequency. This was the first time we had heard anything regarding the other aircraft with similar callsign and same flight number. The Controller then said for us to be aware of the other aircraft on the other frequency with a similar callsign and same XXX flight number and re-issued the clearance for us to descend at pilots discretion to FL240. I read back the clearance and continued descending from FL260 to FL240. The Controller then advised the other aircraft of our similar callsign and same XXX flight number. The radio was very quiet but we never heard the other aircraft check in so I have to assume that they had checked in with Miami Center before we did. There were no TCAS alerts or other indication that there had been a conflict with another aircraft but the fact remains that we descended 9,000 before the Controller issued the clearance for us to descend at pilot's discretion. Nothing else was said by the Controller. Cause, two aircraft with similar callsigns and exact same flight number in the same sector being handled by the same Controller in two different frequencies and neither one of the aircraft was aware of the other. Neither aircraft had the chance to catch the error by saying 'I think somebody else took our clearance'. The Controller should have also heard two read backs as he/she was manning both frequencies.

Air Carrier on frequency with ZMA described callsign confusion when the Controller was working two frequencies with two aircraft with identical flight numbers, no advisory was issued by ATC.

The decision was made after a conversation with Maintenance Control and Dispatch to return to departure airport. During the conversation with Maintenance and Dispatch both parties kept telling the crew that we could reset Circuit Breakers (C/Bs) in flight. We felt this was a clear change to our new joint operations policy. After telling Maintenance we could not reset a C/B in flight they proceeded to tell us we could and that we just did not want to. After a long discussion we found that there was bold guidance in the flight manual that states specifically pilots are NOT allowed to reset a C/B in flight. Dispatch then suggested the Captain use emergency authority to reset the C/B at which time an emergency did not exist. The Captain and I declined the suggestion. The flight returned to IAD uneventfully.				An A320 flight crew refused to reset a popped circuit breaker in flight as directed by Maintenance Control; citing a specific bold print prohibition against doing so in the newly developed joint FOM for the two recently merged air carriers.

The odor seemed to start shortly after I heard the forward outflow valve open on the aircraft pressurization system. I immediately donned my O2 mask and kept it on until after the engines were shutdown and we were on the gate. I was monitoring the service interphone and I heard the flight attendants discussing the dirty sock odor as well. My First Officer placed both recirculation fan switches to the 'OFF' position and left them there for the remainder of the flight. Since we had the airport in sight and were in the process of being cleared for an approach I made the decision not to consult the QRC/QRH procedure for 'Smoke, Fire, or Fumes in Passenger Cabin, Flight Deck or main Deck Cargo Compartment' since I felt the most important task was to get the passengers and crew off the jet as soon as possible in order to mitigate any possible ill effects that could result from the dirty sock odor. To accomplish this task I felt it was necessary to land as soon as possible and I felt that by referencing the QRC/QRH I would be taking the first officer out of the loop in a critical phase of flight when our most important priority was to land the jet and deplane as soon as possible. Also, since there was only an odor and no visible fumes detected, no thought was given to the possibility of ordering a passenger evacuation due to concerns of possible injuries from the evacuation being much worse than simply leaving everyone on the plane for just a few extra minutes and deplaning via the jetway. The odor seemed to start shortly after I heard the forward outflow valve open on the  aircraft pressurization system.		On descent passing through approximately 6000', a strong odor filled the flight deck and remained until engine shutdown at the gate approximately 15 minutes later. The smell was a musty, old (dirty sock) like smell, and at one point almost like melting crayons. With less than 5 minutes to touchdown from the time the odor was noticed, the Captain and I donned our oxygen masks for the remainder of the flight. After landing on the taxi in we also opened our windows and turned off the packs and recirc fans. After the flight felt shaky and loss of energy (weak).		A B737-800 Crew detected a strong dirty socks smell at 5,000' on the approach, so they donned oxygen masks, turned the RECIRC Fans OFF and proceeded to land ASAP. The First Officer felt ill.

We immediately donned oxygen masks and established inter-cockpit communications. The cabin altitude indicated 12,000 FT with a 500 to 700 FPM climb rate. Packs were verified in the auto position and the bleed switches were on. No other annunciator lights were illuminated. A descent was coordinated with Center and quickly initiated. During the descent, we continued to attempt to correct the malfunction by attempting to manually close the outflow valve though it already indicated closed. We additionally placed the packs to high and activated the recirc fan. Descending through approximately FL300, the cabin altitude began to descend and control of the pressurization system regained. We leveled at FL200, and assessed that the cabin altitude was below 10,000 FT and descending.At this point we removed our oxygen masks, evaluated the aircraft systems, and determined our ability to continue or possibly diverting. We then informed the flight attendants of the situation. They informed us that the supplemental oxygen masks had not deployed, an indication the cabin altitude did not exceed 14,000 FT, and that the passengers were completely unaware of the pressurization problem. I established verbal communication with Dispatch to allow them to review our situation and fuel state. Based on the current ability to hold pressurization, lack of passenger issues, destination weather, and fuel state we determined, we could safely continue to our destination at FL200 and still have the required fuel reserves. The remainder of the flight was otherwise uneventful and the flight was met by the aircraft maintainers who were briefed on the nature and indications of the malfunction. Maintenance Control was also briefed. A logbook entry was made and aircraft turned over to maintenance for evaluation.		[Narrative two contained no new information]		A B737-700 flight crew reported abnormal cabin pressure in cruise at FL390. They donned masks and ran the procedure, and after descending to FL200 regained control of the cabin, allowing them to continue to destination at that altitude.

ATIS indicated only Runway 18C was open. I had briefed for that approach. I also stated in my briefing that due to the time of the morning (circadian rhythm), our weight and high landing speed (Vref of 148 or 149 KIAS for company preferred flaps three arrivals), if they opened up Runway 23 and assigned it to us, we would NOT accept that runway for our arrival. Note: normally, this runway is listed in the ATIS for large four engine and turbojet aircraft for noise abatement before 0630 or 0700 local. However, this runway is by far the shortest of the four runways with a severe downhill gradient. But that morning it was not being advertised on the ATIS. As soon as we were handed off to Charlotte Approach, we were told to expect a visual to Runway 23. The First Officer politely declined the runway assignment. We were then told to expect Runway 18R. We ended up being vectored behind a company flight, another Airbus. I found out later in the hotel van that they were vectored behind a Dash 8. We were told to maintain 4,000 FT and vectored behind company flight on final for 18R. Our vector would put us right over the FAVA point. But we had slowed to 180 KIAS so at that point things were good. We were told we would be following a company Airbus three miles ahead. By this time we were fully configured for a flaps three landing. At the 1,000 FT auto call I noted we were only 2 1/2 miles behind company according to my TCAS readout on my ND. And we were just inside 2 1/2 miles at the time [company] apparently touched down on 18R. But he made the first turn-off so the runway was clear well before we got there. I had loaded the 200 FT decision altitude in the MDA field of the PERF page so we got the 'hundred above' and 'minimums' auto callouts. A second or two after the 'minimums' call-out the aircraft rolled to the left about 15-20 degrees. I countered with about half right stick and the aircraft started to recover when, all of a sudden, the aircraft rolled fast to a steeper bank to the right. I countered with full left stick yet the aircraft continued top roll right. I had the stick hard against the stop yet it continued to roll right. I was pretty sure we were in a wake turbulence encounter and being so close to the ground I simultaneously pulled the nose up to fifteen degrees, pushed the thrust levers to TOGA and called out 'Go-around, TOGA..... NAV.' The airplane responded with a good climb, the aircraft stopped rolling as we pitched up and it followed my stick inputs to level the wings and we completed the initial phase of the go-around procedure. As we finished that at about 500 FT AGL, and before the First Officer had a chance to call the go-around to the Tower, we got a quick call from the Tower saying to turn right to heading 270 degrees for traffic departing Runway 23. We simultaneously received a TCAS Traffic Advisory. I was head inside starting the turn and saw the TA target was not far; However, I cannot recall the altitude difference. I took a quick look outside after getting the heading set at 270, but never saw the other aircraft. We completed the normal go-around procedure and cleaned up to flaps one as we were given an immediate turn to the downwind for Runway 18R. After we landed, we were given a phone number to call by the Ground Controller. I made the call once inside the terminal. I didn't understand the name or title of the person who answered, but it sounded like a supervisor in the TRACON and not the Tower. He basically wanted to know if they had done anything to cause the go-around. At that time, being a bit tired, I said 'no.' But reflecting back on the event, I'm not so sure. Perhaps we were vectored in too close behind company. We were definitely overtaking him for two reasons: 1) his choice of flaps full instead of flaps three as we had done and, 2) his need to slow down behind the Dash 8. I did tell him about our TA with the aircraft departing Runway 23, as I wasn't sure how close we were to him. The man on the other end of the call said we weren't close at all as the Controller on 23 saw us initiate the go around. That Controller immediately called it out to the [departing aircraft] crew and instructed them to turn to a heading of 180, which he said they did right away. He said we weren't close at all.				An A320 Captain reported encountering wake vortex from preceding A320 on approach to CLT, resulting in a strong right roll. A go around was executed and a safe landing followed.

We coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control, got a new release, topped off the fuel and departed. The same crew flew this aircraft the previous day. We had the same ECAM on engine start, the FM reset didn't help. We were delayed for 4 or 5 hours while Maintenance got a SEC and an actuator transducer flown in from another station. The SEC that arrived was a bad part and couldn't be used. The transducer was put in the cargo hold. Maintenance re-racked the first SEC, the fault was cleared and the aircraft released. The aircraft then spent that night, apparently with no further work done.				A320 Captain experiences F/CTL SPOILER FAULT ECAM during takeoff and rejects.

It was brought to my attention by the First Officer that his ND was displaying 'Map Not Available' in red color; no map was displayed on the number 2 ND. Seconds later a level 2 ECAM (single chime) with the message of CAB PR LDG ELEV FAULT, which was then accompanied by another fault, the lower ECAM GW display was amber XX LBS. As the pilot not flying I began to troubleshoot what seemed to be the most critical aspect of the multiple failures. At the time it seemed that the Cabin Pressurization was the most critical, not to mention, it was that problem that triggered the Level 2 caution. Once I determined that the integrity of the pressurization system was not compromised, I moved on to the other issue, the lack of the map display on the First Officer side. It seemed that the number 2 FMGC had failed, however, the PFD indications were consistent with no failures. FMA's displayed MACH ALT CRZ NAV all in green, no mode reversions had occurred. Even the FD mode was 1FD2. Yet, as I scanned over to my display, I realized the aircraft failed to make a turn upon passing the previous fix so I immediately went to HEADING Mode turning the aircraft back to re-intercept the course and engage AP1. The deviation was 6.1 NM left of course. At that moment, ATC had queried our position and asked what our next FIX was; I told ATC what our next fix was. I then requested DIRECT, and was cleared direct. This lateral deviation would have been avoided had the aircraft been equipped with a lateral deviation alert similar to altitude deviation alerts that most aircraft are equipped with. Although flying the airplane is the priority at all times, it was very deceiving to the pilots when the aircraft indicated that it is flying based on what the PFD FMA's were displaying. As a former instructor on this airplane, I always used to tell my students to believe what the FMA displays. In this case, it lied about its NAV capability, even though it displayed a normal green NAV display, it wasn't. There must be a communication link between the ND and the PFD.	The Reporter stated that the disparity between the green FMA status indications and the FMGC failure to correctly guide the autopilot could not be reconciled. The FMGC faults should have triggered a transition to the default heading mode along with an appropriate FMA change. The only indication the crew saw, other than the ECAM, was the ND2's MAP display fault and on further investigation both FMGC's displayed amber INDEPENDENT OPERATION in small letters at the bottom of the screen. The autopilot was selected to number one and functioned normally to landing. All systems were operating normally even with the FMGC anomalies. After landing the systems reset and operated normally.			An A320 number 2 ND MAP failed and the autopilot did not track correctly causing a track deviation although the FMA indications remained green and the FMGCs entered independent operations.

If that is the case, why does the chart assign JEMSU at 8,000 FT? ATC asked us to highlight this dilemma to our flight crews. We were in VNAV PATH and did not respond to the descent instruction quickly enough.		We requested RNAV (RNP) Z Runway 29 from BUSHY. We were on the PXN Arrival. We were cleared via the BUSHY transition, expect approach clearance shortly. The aircraft was in VNAV PATH and after BUSHY, our clearance was to descend and maintain 6,000 FT. The Controller expected us to descend to 6,000 FT, and I understood the clearance. Still in VNAV PATH, the aircraft was descending, but leveled off at 7,500 FT. I realized that the aircraft leveled off and I took a few moments to figure out what I messed up, then selected V/S and descended again. ATC noticed the level off. The Controller stated he has had problems with Company Crews making this same error and to pass along that this interferes with SFO arrival traffic. The Controller sounded very frustrated.		Air Carrier arriving OAK, routed via Bushy, was questioned by ATC regarding the late descent to 6,000, noting the potential conflict with SFO traffic routed overhead, the flight crew acknowledged late response to descent instructions.

Approach cleared us 'direct KRENA, cross KRENA at 10,000 and 310 KTS'. The Controller then said [to us], 'Runway 28, 'North flow,' or 'North traffic'.' We didn't ask the Controller what routing he wanted at that point. We input all that into the FMS, and descended to make the crossing restriction. When Runway 28 is loaded into the FMS, it also changes the arrival routing after the SOOLU Intersection; that published routing is south of the airport. We looked at the routing, but didn't realize that Approach might want us to do something different until the aircraft behind us began to ask Approach to clarify the routing. Approach told the aircraft behind us to fly to KURKK, VULCN, etc., all points on the north side of the field, and published for Runways 27L, 27R, 22R, etc.Based on this overheard conversation, we realized we might be on the wrong track, and manually put KURKK into the FMS, but it was behind us. At this point Approach gave us a 090 vector, which puts us on a 'Northside'--or right hand--downwind and descended us to 4,000. We continued to set up for the approach (a visual) and subsequent landing on Runway 28. Approach never asked us about our routing, so I still don't really know what was expected of us. After we got to the gate, and deplaned the passengers, we looked at the BULLZ2 arrival, and there is no mention of 'North flow', and confirmed that once Runway 28 is put into the FMS, it changes the arrival after SOOLU Intersection. This arrival is new for the crews and for ORD Approach. Over the years, late night arrivals from the west, to Runway 28 have been primarily on the north side of the airport, and it seems that ORD Approach is continuing to use that route. But with the new arrival procedure, crews need to know what routing to use, and that in this scenario, they will have to manually input all the north side points into the FMS, as it will auto-load the southern points.	The reporter advised he had discussed the event with his union safety representative who, in turn, contacted and conferred with ORD Approach Control. The reporter reported that the event took place on the first day of utilization of the new procedure and that the 'north flow' terminology had been quickly determined to be inappropriate and revised terminology is being developed. He also advised that the need for 'phraseology inconsistent with the charted procedure' is the result of late night closures of the other westbound runways, thus requiring that all arrivals from the west be directed to Runway 28. They (ATC) are aware that terminology 'consistent' with the Chart is 'inconsistent' with and inappropriate for use under those conditions.The reporter also commented that he was aware that his suggestion to NOTAM or Bulletin directives for flight crews to manually enter fixes was inconsistent with his airline's SOP which precludes manual entries in the terminal area.	...we were told by Chicago Approach to 'Expect Runway 28, North Flow'. At that point, the Captain and I discussed what this terminology might mean, since there is nothing specified on the arrival procedure. We concluded we should expect vectors to the north of ORD for a right base to the ILS 28. I inserted Runway 28, BLUTO transition, verified the points and ensured LNAV was selected. I did not; however review the points on the STAR relative to the magenta line after inserting the runway as I probably should have. The rest of the arrival and approach was conducted using radar vectors and existing ILS Runway 28 FMS approach points.Currently, our FMS database does not include the Bullz2 arrival diversion points, or a way to differentiate between 'North flow' and 'South flow' except by using runway assignments in the FMS. Additionally, there is no verbiage on the STAR delineating between 'north flow' and 'south flow', except by runway. I suggest an immediate NOTAM and a company bulletin regarding the database and advising crews to manually insert FMS points into the computer when runways are closed.		Confusion regarding a newly issued revision to the BULLZ STAR to ORD and Approach Control's use of the phrase '...North flow or North traffic' to Runway 28 may have resulted in a track deviation for a B737-800 flight crew.

I read back the clearance and requested Runway 25L for the transition and landing. The Controller advised they were not able to offer that transition and we accepted the Runway 26 transition. We had previously set up the arrival for the 25L transition.We then discussed the need to match the FMC programming to the clearance and I initiated the change to the Runway 26 transition. After some confusion and questions when referring to the approach plate I was able to identify the proper transition in the FMC, select confirm and execute. This resulted in a discontinuity immediately after our next fix. I was able to clean up the discontinuity in a timely manner, however, I believe that as a result of the very complex sequence of crossing and speed restrictions the FMC then went through a recalculation of the computed path. We had already complied with an altitude restriction and speed restriction of 270 KTS at TINIZ. Per the arrival we were to maintain 270 for approximately 30 more miles. After the reprogramming of the FMC and the recalculation of the path we received a scratch pad message of STEEP DESCENT AFTER EAGUL. We noted this and cleared the scratch pad.Very soon after that message and prior to EAGUL the aircraft started a steep VPATH descent. I believe we received a drag required message and the pilot pulled speed brakes to the flight detent because the power was at idle. In a few moments the speed quickly gained 20-25 KTS of airspeed. Almost immediately ATC gave us a turn off the arrival and a descent to a lower altitude. At the same time the pilot flying switched to Vertical Speed then Level Change to facilitate a reduction of airspeed. The Controller asked us if we were maintaining 270 I briefly explained our speed excursion. From that point we received vectors to Runway 25L for a normal approach and landing.If I were to re-run this arrival I would start by initially programming the runway transition that should be expected from ATC, not our preferred transition. This would have alleviated the recalculation, discontinuity and disruption to the calculated path on this very complex arrival. VNAV works well in the BBJ but it is not tolerant of significant adjustments while descending on a predetermined path. It is also critical to remember that in VPATH the aircraft will fly the path even if that means overspeed from a speed constraint. The constraint at EAGUL has a 5,000 FT altitude window, between FL230 and FL180. Making that a hard at crossing at FL180 could have moved the Top Of Descent [TOD] further back and eliminated the need for the steep descent later in the flight. Things changed very quickly after the reprogramming of the FMC. Although it seemed like ATC intervened immediately, we should have changed vertical modes sooner to assure speed control and advised ATC of any difficulty meeting further constraints.				A B737-700 flight crew delayed re-programming their FMS for the EAGUL RNAV STAR Runway 26 transition vice their anticipated Runway 25L transition. The delay caused them to be too high to make the altitude restrictions while maintaining the airspeeds required. A deviation occurred and Approach Control intervened.

The new frequency on the right side would change but would not switch to the active side.  Since the left ILS frequency could not be set, the RNAV (GPS) 22L was selected, briefed, requested and flown.  When we were cleared for the approach, the approach mode would not select.  Despite numerous attempts to select approach, no guidance was achieved.  Fortunately, we were in VFR conditions and an uneventful visual approach to touchdown was flown.  The FOM briefing flow charts and briefing cards were utilized during the brief.  Neither the First Officer nor I could figure out why the approach mode would not engage.  A maintenance entry was made but the autopilot systems checked normally.  I still have no idea why the approach was not successful.  Systems training on the 737 is poor to nonexistent.  I feel ill equipped to understand or predict what the aircraft will do in any degraded system mode.  A modern multimedia systems training course should be designed and implemented to increase pilot systems knowledge of the aircraft.				A B737-800 Captain reported that the number 2 NAV radio head failed precluding an ILS and subsequently the APP mode would not arm for the RNAV (GPS) approach so a visual approach was completed.

I engaged VNAV and we started descending. Before we got to 33,000 FT, we were cleared off the airway and given a different altitude, then slowed to 250 KTS and told to cross SCOLE at 280 KTS or less. Shortly after, we were cleared to BLYTHE and to descend via the arrival, except for airspeed. Since we were below path at this point, I selected vertical speed 1,000 FT and was going to wait to get back on path before selecting VNAV again. Once we were cleared for the arrival, I selected 15,000 FT in the MCP for protection on the next crossing altitude. We were then cleared again via the arrival and to comply with speeds. As we approached MUNSTR, the restriction was 15,000 FT and I noticed the airplane shallowing out the descent and started to look at the box to see what exactly was happening. I noticed a speed intervention of 250 KTS selected. At that point, the Captain said we should cross at 15,000 FT and we noticed the plane was about 500 FT below. I stopped the descent and returned to 15,000 FT. There was no conflict with other aircraft or terrain and that was it. We descended the rest of the arrival on path. I would like to see ATC manage the arrivals better. In a highly complex arrival with multiple altitude and speed changes, it adds complexity to be given different speeds and altitudes and then told to go back to the original arrival profile. We could have verbalized better what the automation was doing when we first sensed confusion.				A B737-NG on the PHX GEELA arrival was vectored off the STAR routing, given a speed restriction, and when in the SPD and V/S modes, the 15,000 FT MUNSTR constraint dropped out so the aircraft did not level.

After engine start, tug crew cleared off. Called for After Start Checklist. While doing the checklist, (in anticipation of a turnout) I looked to the right and asked to confirm that right side of aircraft was clear. Checklist completed with recall pushed and no lights, but not really (the packs were in off and I didn't verify First Officer flow complete as I should have). I missed that the First Officer had not actually placed the packs to auto. Taxi out was normal. We again recapped the earlier discussed max takeoff due to gusty winds and the anticipated turn and climb out at 250 KTS due to the winds, and routing after takeoff. Takeoff clearance call was missed by the First Officer on the parallel taxiway and I responded. Called for the Before Takeoff Checklist as we turned the corner short of the runway. First Officer read the checklist and I missed that the packs were off. I saw and called out what I expected to see, not what was actually set. Not rushed or in a hurry, just plain missed it when I looked at the First Officer actually touching the switches as he read the checklist. First Officer flying, max takeoff normal due to gusty winds and previous loss of airspeed on approach to landing. Climb out was normal with ATC conversations. TRACON frequency change and slight delay between 6,000 FT and 9,000 FT due to coordination. Next check-in and ATC conversation with Center occurred as we passed through 10,000 FT in climb to assigned FL 190, still climbing at 250 KTS due to gusty winds and turbulence. Upon check-in with Center, we again asked for on course vector. Between 12,000 FT and 14,000 FT, we finally finished talking with ATC and almost immediately got the beeping horn and the Cabin Altitude lights on the forward panel. I immediately commanded a descent as I assessed the situation. I took control of the aircraft from the First Officer and directed the First Officer to don his mask and establish comm. I pulled the power to idle and opened the speed brakes for the descent. As I pulled my mask out to don it, I made a quick call requesting a lower altitude and descent to at least 10,000 FT. The First Officer then confirmed his mask was on and he could talk. I gave him control of the aircraft and told him to continue the descent and talk to Approach Control. I put my mask on and established communication. We were cleared to descend and make a turn to 330 degrees. As we continued to descend, I asked for a vector toward the departure airport where we could set up a holding pattern (if need be) as we determined our problem. No emergency declared. I looked at the pressurization panel and all looked normal. (Packs were in auto) with the cabin altitude holding steady around 10,000 FT. We continued to descend and I completed the QRH items. I then established communication with the departure station and Dispatch through a radio patch. First Officer was still flying and now also talking to Approach. Initially we both questioned the cabin altitude and adequate pressurization. Initial agreed decision was to do a return to get the aircraft fixed. As we discussed the situation between ourselves and Dispatch, the cabin altitude stabilized normally. I mentioned that I had never seen or heard of an aircraft not pressurizing with the packs in auto, but then again things happen. The First Officer then told me that they were in off in the climb out. I asked him again about the switch positions and he again told me that they were off. I told him that they were definitely in auto when I checked the panel in the descending turn back to the departure airport. He admitted that when he looked at the panel after putting on his mask, he had found them in off and placed them to auto. I did recall seeing/hearing him throw some switches as we started the descent, but it didn't register until he told me what he had done. At the time, I think I thought he had gone too high, but when I looked at the panel in the descent, the switches were in auto where they should have been. No more thought to that until our discussion. With the situation newly assessed as a crew issue and no actual system malfunction, my question was now whether we had enough fuel on board to continue to our planned destination. I queried Dispatch and their calculations matched what the FMC was computing. We would arrive with 5.6+ LBS fuel. We agreed that our fuel state was adequate to continue and he made note of that. We coordinated our request with ATC and proceeded to our filed destination. Landing was uneventful. We shut down at the gate with 5.2 LBS. No emergency declared. No emergency masks deployed. No system malfunctions. I take full responsibility for: 1) Distracting my First Officer with a question as he was reading the checklist after start and before taxi. 2) Not verifying his flow completion as I normally do. 3) Not physically catching the fact that the packs were in off vice auto when the First Officer touched the switches and when he read the Before Takeoff Checklist. Do not interrupt checklist reading with a question that could have waited 15 more seconds and verify (as I normally do) switch positions after flow completion by First Officer. I thought I saw the packs in auto when the First Officer touched the switches prior to takeoff. I think my mind saw what I expected to see and I responded as such. More attention to detail.				A B737-700 Captain distracted the First Officer during taxi out for takeoff and both pilots missed the pack switches in the OFF position until the CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING sounded at about 14,000 FT.

We were just coming up upon abeam the airport and eventually were cleared for the visual to Runway 31L. I told the approach controller that we would be making a longer downwind to lose altitude plus both myself and the Captain had never been to this airport before so we wanted to play it cautiously. We planned on flying all the fixes on the approach but once we were comfortable with our altitude and space we turned towards the airport for the approach. We were probably 15 to 20 miles out with the airport environment in sight. We had the beacon, as well as some airport lighting in sight and were following the published approach course for the VOR-B approach to 31L. At least 10 miles out we had what we believed to be the runway and the VASI in sight. We configured prior to the final approach fix and descended along the VOR-B course. Never once did we see a second set of runway lights or anything to make us believe this was the wrong runway. I did get the feeling that the runway looked small but thought it was just an optical illusion born of the terrain. We descended below MDA (2,350 FT AGL with airport elev. of 477 FT) on the approach course to fly visually to the runway. At somewhere below 1,000 FT AGL I still had the feeling that something didn't look right. The runway lights were very bright and we were right on the VASI. Somewhere in this area I realized that we were lined up on the wrong runway as I started noticing the lights for the other runway. The lights for RWY 31L were much farther spaced out and definitely seemed to be at a much lower intensity. I immediately stated to the Captain that we were lined up for 31R and we needed to go around. We performed the go-around and returned to land runway 31L without further incident. No other traffic was evident and no special handling was needed. Neither the Captain nor myself had ever previously been to PSP. The key for our error was the fact that 10 to 15 or so miles out we had the runway lights and the VASI in sight for one runway on the airport. We made the incorrect assumption that that was for our runway. Unfortunately they were for Runway 31R. We knew there were 2 runways that were close together parallel from our briefing but assumed since the lighting was so bright it must have been the correct runway. Upon our return to the airport after the go-around we guessed that the runway lights for 31R were probably at Medium to High and the runway lights for 31L were probably at low. The lights for 31R were also closer together and appeared to be newer (white) while 31L appeared to older (yellow). We did find it rather odd after the fact that 31R was so well lit while 31L was definitely not. What we should have done is found both runways upon getting closer to the airport to guarantee that we were lined up with the correct runway. As there is no ILS or LOC for lateral guidance, we discussed possibly extending the center line on the runway in the MCDU to better orientate the offset center line of the correct runway. Also, the First Officer side MCDU had gone blank in the descent and was inop causing another distraction. As we discussed, extending the center line on the runway on the MCDU was an option we could have taken advantage of. The reality is, we just need to make sure we can verify that we are lined up with the correct runway since there is truly no lateral guidance available here. In this case we should have made sure we had both runways in sight so we could verify that we were headed to the correct runway. I do feel we made the correct go around call rather then forcing a possible unstable approach.				A320 First Officer determines late in a visual approach to Runway 31L at PSP that they are lined up with Runway 31R and calls for a go around.  The lights for Runway 31R were far brighter and whiter than those for Runway 31L.

Still not a problem as they approved a right turn. As I was in the turn Tower then commanded a LEFT turn; as I rolled out spotted traffic below at 11 o'clock and low. At that time a TCAS RA commanded a climb as traffic was about 2 miles and 200 FT below us. Responded to RA and initiated a climb. Passed traffic with about 400 FT separation. Reacquired final and landed normally on the runway.				A B737 flight crew, high on the approach to the runway at their destination, requested a 360 degree turn to lose altitude and experienced a TCAS RA with another aircraft while doing so.

The autothrottles were not maintaining commanded speed selected and I was over riding to maintain speed and troubleshooting reason for throttle problem. I started down with runway in sight and cleared to land. Once I realized we had not reached the first intersection yet I disconnected autopilot and corrected altitude and continued to configure for 30 flap and uneventful landing. Be aware of fatigue onset. We had a very challenging day at SNA. BC LOC 1L, wind shear. After engine start at SNA ready for bleed off balanced field dept on 1L Tower switched runway, new clearance, TPS, FMS, etc, etc, etc. Even a generic ILS can bite you if you let your guard down. I will ensure better discussion of step down or altitude changes before initiating. We could have also just called the field and accepted a visual approach clearance. I will ensure not to confuse Non ILS procedures with ILS.				B737 pilot reports descending early on an ILS approach in VMC possibly due to fatigue after a very challenging day of flying.

After 80 KTS and prior to rotation speed, the First Officer's window slid completely open. The Captain took control of the aircraft, and completed the rotation. Once safely airborne, the First Officer attempted to close the window, but it was mechanically impossible. The First Officer held the window mostly closed with arm strength so that interphone and radio communication were possible. When the Captain realized the window was not going to close, he requested to divert and was given heading and altitude assignments to facilitate a timely landing. The First Officer tuned all of the radios, reset the FMC for the landing airport, and ensured all checklist items were complete and resumed ATC communication while the Captain flew the aircraft. While on final approach the window fell completely out of the track and onto the First Officer. The First Officer simply placed the window on his armrest and continued the call outs throughout the landing sequence. Once safely on the ground and clear of both active runways, the Captain made a PA explaining what had happened and the reason for diverting. There was not enough time to communicate with flight attendants and passengers. Frankly, it was so loud in the cockpit that it may not have been practical and would likely have caused more alarm than was necessary. Maintenance met the aircraft at the gate, inspected the track, replaced the window, and cleared the logbook. One of the Maintenance Technicians pointed out that the locking pin on the faulty window was not working correctly.		The First Officer was the pilot flying as we started the takeoff. Between 80 KTS and Vr, the First Officer direct vision window came open and slid back. I took control of the aircraft and made the rotation and remained pilot flying for the remainder of the flight. The First Officer attempted to close the window as I made the turn to 210 degrees and continued the climb to 4,000 FT. ATC cleared us to a higher altitude and a turn northwest, but the First Officer was unable to close the window even after multiple attempts. I requested and was given clearance to remain at 4,000 FT. I retracted flaps and accelerated to 210 KTS, but the wind noise was getting too loud so I put the flaps back down and slowed the aircraft. I did not declare an emergency but told ATC that we had a window open and wanted to divert as quickly as possible. ATC gave us a climb to 5,000 FT and vectored us to the east, then south, until we called the airport in sight and they issued a visual approach. The First Officer held the window as much closed as he could for the entire flight to keep the noise level down as much as possible. At some point before landing, I noticed that part of the window was out of its sliding track. The landing was uneventful.This was our second flight in this aircraft and the First Officer stated that he had not opened the window on the ground and had in fact checked the window to verify that it was closed before takeoff. The biggest issue of this event was communication. The First Officer and I could not communicate without the use of the intercom system. Until the First Officer realized to keep his hot MIC out of the wind as much as possible, I had a few brief moments that made communication with ATC difficult. If that situation had gotten worse, I would have declared an emergency.		B737 flight crew reports the First Officer's sliding window coming open during takeoff with the First Officer as the flying pilot. The Captain assumes control and continues the takeoff while the First Officer attempts without success to close the window. The crew diverts to a suitable airport with ATC assistance and lands safely.

Oil pressure was in the red at 8 PSI and remained at that reading to landing. Number 1 throttle was reduced to idle immediately and thereafter oil quantity went to zero. LOSS OF OIL PRESSURE Checklist led to ENGINE FAILURE or SHUTDOWN Checklist and the engine was secured. The First Officer was designated to land the aircraft. I called ATC and declared an emergency requesting a lower altitude and declaring a nearby airport for diversion. I completed all remaining checklists, notified flight attendants, passengers, and Dispatch and then landed uneventfully. I have no suggestions for avoiding a recurrence as the problem was caused by a maintenance issue. However, I can offer the following; the aircraft assigned to us had just had an engine replaced and this was the first flight after engine change. I was concerned so I left the lower Display Unit on during flight to monitor engine parameters. At top of climb, the left side showed seventeen quarts of oil and the right side showed eighteen quarts of oil. I saw no abnormal indications until the loss of oil pressure was discovered in cruise.				A B737-800 lost right engine oil quantity and pressure at cruise because the engine was incorrectly install prior to this flight. An emergency was declared and the flight diverted.

We immediately referred to the QRH and performed and in-flight engine shutdown. Air speed started to decay and a descent was initiated to FL250. FMS indicated a drift down altitude of 26,500. An emergency was declared with ATC. Aircraft was currently 80 NM from ZZZ which was considered the closest suitable alternate because of time required to descend, run checklist, and coordinate with Dispatch and the flight attendants. A controlled descent was planned and accomplished with no intermediate level offs until configuring at 2,000 FT on final approach. All checklists were completed and an uneventful, single engine ILS was flown. Fire coverage noted no abnormalities and escorted the aircraft to a jet bridge. Passengers were deplaned while arrangements were made for continued transportation. All involved agencies and services did an outstanding job in seamlessly assisting the crew in getting the aircraft and passengers safely to the gate.We were aware that the left engine was newly installed and there was a preflight discussion between the pilots on whether and engine change required any kind of functional check flight. Special attention was given to the engine during preflight but no discrepancies were noted. I am not familiar with how often engines are changed or removed from aircraft outside of 'C' checks. Functional check flights are required following those inspections for many reasons. If the number of engine changes outside of 'C' checks are rare, I wonder how many in flight shutdowns during revenue flights could be avoided if a functional or operational check flight was required following the hanging of a new engine.				B737 pilot described an in flight engine shut down due to loss of oil quantity and pressure. The flight diverted to a suitable airport after declaring an emergency. The engine was recently installed on this aircraft.

I printed out MEL 21- 26-04 and we went thru it together. When I went thru the process of opening skin air outlet valve per MEL 21-26-04 I got confused with the instructions provided. MEL Figure-A does not differentiate the [outlet valve] main door from the auxiliary door and internal valve doors. This picture only shows the handle, the On/Off switch and auxiliary flap (which appears to be pointing at whole door). Also instructions are a little confusing. So I made the mistake of partially opening the main flap instead of the auxiliary flap. Then I proceeded to finish the rest of the maintenance MEL procedure. I asked Mechanic Y to take a look at the MEL procedure and told him what I had done. He agreed that the MEL was confusing and agreed with what I had done. Then Mechanic Y did an Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) Test and finished paperwork. We heard on the radio that the airplane was coming back to the gate. Air turn back [due to] avionics outlet skin air valve main door was not fully closed, [causing] an avionics vent fault.Then Mechanic Y and I did more research involving Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 21-26-00 and Task 21-26-00-040-002 that made it very clear on position required of main/auxiliary [outlet valve] flaps and Deactivation Procedure. We re-accomplished Deactivation Procedure in accordance with MEL and AMM 21-26-00 and Task 21-26-00-040-002, re-accomplished the Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) Test and paperwork. Suggest better labeling of figures/drawings and procedures in MEL 21-26-04 and more classroom/hands-on training.		An A320 aircraft returned to gate after pushback due to avionics vent fault. I went to determine what was wrong with it and found avionics vent skin air outlet valve fault.  Contacted Maintenance Control and we agreed to defer the vent skin air outlet valve using MEL 21-26-04. Mechanic X came to help me. He accomplished the MEL maintenance procedure and I did the Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) Test and signed the paperwork.		Two Technicians report about misinterpreting an MEL 21-26-04 Maintenance procedure for deferring an A320 aircraft's skin air outlet valve in the closed position. Inadequate MEL Maintenance illustrations lead them to believe the skin valve's main door, not the smaller auxiliary door, should be left partially opened.

The Captain then said we should plan for a possible wind shear encounter so I changed the data per the procedure and it changed the departure flap setting from one to five. I then changed all the information in the FMC and told the Captain that the flap setting changed.We were just pulling up to the runway and had been cleared for takeoff. We were talking about the profile, but forgot to reset the flaps to five. We took off and used the higher rotate speed and lifted the flaps via the profile. The flight proceeded and we landed without incident.		On taxi out, ATC advised of multiple aircraft reporting an airspeed change of plus or minus 15-20 KTS at 1,000. We realized our error as we were cleaning up the aircraft on departure. No adverse effects on takeoff or departure.		When alerted to reports of windshear on initial climb the flight crew of a B737-700 recalculated their takeoff data appropriately but failed to reset the flaps to the required setting prior to takeoff. No adverse effects resulted and the flight proceeded uneventfully.

All the flight attendants wanted to tell me what they smelled and were clearly concerned. I asked if there actually dirty socks or anything to account for the smell. They reported in the negative. I asked if it smelled like deicing fluid and they said no. (We had deiced prior to takeoff due to moderate accretion of mixed ice on arrival on the previous flight.) I told them that an airport was straight ahead and that we may divert and to keep me updated frequently. I asked the First Officer to contact Operation Control through the Operation Control frequency. Operation Control did not come up under repeated calls. (We later heard that it hadn't been monitored). He then made contact by relaying through Airport Operations frequency. I typed messages to Dispatch informing that we may need to divert and asked if there was a history of fume events on the aircraft. I called back to the flight attendants and asked if the fumes had dissipated. They said it 'may' be less strong, but it was still there. I asked if the passengers had smelled it and they said yes, but had not reported it. They reported that a couple felt ill. Remembering the Union Safety Committee admonition and the Director of Flight's update on the fume events ('We are continuing to address each and every one of these air quality issues by immediately removing an affected aircraft from service.') to treat these events [as a] QRH Fume event and land at the nearest suitable airport; I decided to divert. I was concerned that we, the passengers and crew, were being exposed to TCP neurotoxins. I ordered O2 masks on, transferred control of the airplane to the First Officer to perform the flying duties, declared an emergency, and descended into the divert station. I informed the flight attendants and the passengers that we would be landing as a precaution in 15 minutes due to an unexplained odor in the cabin. There was little time to continue with the QRH Fume procedures or contact our contract medical service. We were vectored by ATC for a visual approach. I saw the runway first and resumed flying duties, landed, taxied to the gate and was met by paramedics. On taxi in I ordered the bleeds and packs to be shutdown. At deplaning, the flight attendants clearly seemed worried about TCP exposure. You could see it in their faces and eyes. We were checked out by paramedics and most of the crew was found to have elevated pulse and BP, and low O2. We declined transport to the hospital, being advised that we should call 911 if we felt ill at the hotel. They strongly recommended that we not continue flying at that time. The flight attendants were surprised after landing because a least two of the passengers, from row 6 and 11, hadn't sought medical treatment from the EMT's. They had reported feeling ill in flight. I faxed a cabin air quality report from the hotel.	The Reporter stated that because of the heightened 'dirty socks' awareness he did not hesitate to respond to the perceived neurotoxin threat although he First Officer attempted to talk him out of responding. His personal physical condition as determined by the paramedics was slightly elevated blood pressure and pulse, and oxygen level at about 90. The Reporter has been in contact with three other crew members who reported no lingering effects although all were to told to seek medical attention if they felt the need. The Reporter's Company did not report to him what was discovered and he personally wonders if maintenance outsourcing is a component in this problem. He was told that of the 'dirty socks' events, maintenance reported the causes as follows: 58% APU, 30% engine, the remainder unknown.			An A320 Captain declared an emergency and diverted after flight attendants and passengers reported a dirty rancid sock smell from row 6 and beyond. Paramedics discovered elevated BP, heart rate, and low O2 levels.

We were delayed departing due to baggage loading. During taxi final ZFW of 396,965# given. With that ZFW weight at takeoff was 544,900# (within limits). After takeoff we were advised of an error in ZFW. New ZFW 399,532#. We were subsequently advised again of another new final ZFW of 399,532#. Based on those ZFWs we had taxied and taken off over our max allowable structural weight. We updated the ZFW in the FMC in flight. Maintenance inspection was to be accomplished after landing.  As an added note to all of this, our new performance takeoff data using SCAP data unbalances the field and reduces required takeoff thrust to a minimum. What, if any, 'pad' this offers is unknown to the crews. The actual runway or performance limits (and available 'pads') are unknown to the crews. Crews were previously more involved, and able to make 'judgment' decisions on flap / runway / takeoff power setting decisions. Crews are now more out of the loop than ever. On this day we were legal for an intersection takeoff and reduced thrust takeoff using full length at the lowest flap setting. Due to winter weather conditions we elected to takeoff full length, max thrust, flaps 15. What kind of runway limit 'pad' did that give us? Don't know under the new process other than it had to be better. How did that affect our performance limit? Don't know under the new process other than it had to be less than flaps 5. With current combination of temperature, airport, and runway we knew performance limit wouldn't be an issue (from experience). All we knew for certain from the supplied runway data was that MTOG (Maximum takeoff weight) remained at 545,000# (structural limit). The PIC is the one on site to make judgment calls. The new procedures do not give the PIC the resources or information to fully use this judgment. This can lead to perhaps less than optimum decisions. The further we take the PIC out of the process and not supply sufficient information, or resources, the worse the situation will become over time and another critical safety component (the PIC) is increasingly removed from the process.				A B777 was notified after takeoff that its taxi weight was over its maximum zero fuel weight (MZFW). The new Company performance data calculations leave the flight crew out of the loop about takeoff runway selection, power settings and other information.

The Reporter stated that the Map display failed on both ND's even though the ND's appeared to continue normal operation. The event occurred in very busy Class B and he momentarily considered executing a missed approach but because of fuel considerations and a very knowledgeable efficient crew they were able to make the required manual navigation radio selections. The lack of automatic loc and glideslope lock-on surprised him. He felt that the Company training for this type event was inadequate and that he was ill prepared for all that transpired. A checklist of some sort for manual radio setup and flight procedures would help but following the checklist would certainly require a go around to get properly set up. The basic fact he will remember is there is no NAVAID auto tuning and the aircraft is flown raw data. After arrival, the aircraft was powered down and after re-powering, all systems returned to normal with no ECAM or other annunciations indicating what had happened.			While on approach vectors, an A320 Map function failed with operating ND's so the STBY NAV Mode was selected, the ILS tuned, and the approach flown raw data to a successful landing. The systems reset after the aircraft was powered down at the gate.

Enroute to PGS ATC cleared us to FL260 and assigned us 280 KIAS. After we leveled off I re-cruised us at FL260. Our planned Cost Index was 36 which calculated a managed descent speed of 282 KIAS. However I had selected 280 on the FCU. East of PGS ATC cleared us to descend via the TYSSN THREE RNAV arrival for a visual approach to Runway 25L. I dialed in 8,000 to meet the restriction at PRINO. Both the First Officer and I had triple checked all the altitude constraints on the arrival, and we both had the constraints pb pushed. PGS has an 'at or above FL200' constraint and CEJAY has an 'at or below FL190' constraint. With a top of descent arrow displayed about halfway between our position and PGS, I engaged managed descent. I calculated we needed 21 miles to get below FL190 over CEJAY from FL260. PGS to CEJAY is 19 miles so I felt safe. I engaged managed descent, with the airplane starting a nominal 900 FPM descent, still in selected speed of 280. I selected the PROG (Progress) page on the MCDU and it showed I was approximately 2,400 FT low on the path but slowly decreasing deviation. The Descent Path Indicator (donut) on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) was at the top of the scale but moving down slowly. I felt very confident (not complacent) that we could meet all constraints without any problem. I was expecting a slower than normal descent since I had started down prior to the computed Top of Descent and we had a roughly direct headwind of 60 plus KTS. Prior to reaching PGS my very sharp First Officer remarked that we had an amber missed constraint circle around CEJAY on the Nav Display (ND). I acknowledged his concern, noted the PROG page showed we were still slightly low on the path with the donut slightly above center. In my mind we were intercepting the path from below. I did briefly check the VERT REV page for CEJAY (on the MCDU) and made sure it showed ALT CSTR -190. But for the life of me I did not think to cross check for an ALT ERROR. My mental math told me I had 19 miles to lose a bit over 5,000 FT. The First Officer again questioned me about the amber missed constraint circle. We were now past PGS still descending at approximately 1,000 FPM, but the donut was centered and the PROG page showed we were on the path. Not once did I think to check the FLT PLAN page and read the altitude over CEJAY. I was trying to come up with an answer as to why I was not getting a MORE DRAG message in the Flight Management Annunciator (FMA) since we had crossed one way point with a constraint. Or why I did not have a vertical discontinuity with a TOO STEEP PATH AHEAD message in the MCDU scratch pad. I became preoccupied with trying to diagnose the conflicting information between my Primary Flight Display (PFD) and my Nav Display (ND). I failed to recheck my mental math or aggressively correct our flight path. I erred in not advising ATC of my mistake. ATC did not mention my mistake. We crossed CEJAY in excess of 1,500 FT high. The First Officer reported he saw FL207 as we crossed. The MCDU showed FL209. At this point I assessed that the airplane would not meet the next restriction 22 miles ahead at KADDY. I disconnected the autopilot and selected full speedbrakes in order to cross KADDY at 250 KIAS and 12,000 FT. About 5 miles prior to KADDY at 12,000 FT and 250 KIAS I re-engaged the autopilot and managed descent. The rest of the profile from KADDY to PRINO was uneventful. PREVENTIVE MEASURES My First Officer deserves a great deal of credit for voicing his concerns about the amber missed constraints circle on the ND. We were anything but complacent. I was mentally scrambling trying to sort out conflicting information and determine a possible input error while thinking any moment the airplane is going to lower the nose and pick up the descent rate. For the life of me I cannot figure out what I did incorrectly.				An A320 Captain on the LAS TYSSN THREE RNAV calculated his descent constraint compliance incorrectly and failed to meet one of the constraints before realizing his error even though his First Officer was cautioning about the error.

We decided upon an appropriate speed (220 KIAS initially with flaps at 1 degree). Captain 'worked' the checklist as I communicated with ATC and flew the airplane. Captain declared the emergency. We received vectors while Captain finished the checklist. He did a superb job supervising the event, and we prepared for landing on the longest runway available and coordinated with ATC to have CFR ready as we were landing very fast and over weight. We landed, flaps 15, approximately 177 KIAS, at approximately 153,500 LBS. After an uneventful landing, we remained in contact with CFR; no smoke or any other abnormalities noted from CFR, who followed us to the gate. Kudos to our training department; have done this in the simulator, and it made this event much more comfortable. Also, this event occurred as a 'repeat' item. Reviewing the logbook prior to departure, we noted the airplane had experienced a LE Flap problem a few days prior.		Upon departure and aircraft clean-up the 'LE FLAPS TRANSIT' light remained illuminated. Informed ATC we may have to return and requested a few minutes to review our procedures. ATC put us in a vectored holding pattern at 7,000 FT. First Officer pilot flying and Captain pilot not flying. [We] reviewed QRH procedure for 'LE FLAPS TRANSIT' light under Flight Controls. Conditions reviewed were as follows: Trailing edge flaps up, no roll encountered, extended flaps to 1 then retracted flaps up, LE FLAPS TRANSIT light remained illuminated, checked LE DEVICES annunciator panel and more than one leading edge device was illuminated. Checked emergency landing data distance and landing data card for flaps 15. Read all procedural notes. Captain declared emergency with ATC and requested landing on longest runway. Planned and executed a flaps 15 landing (Vref 15 + 15 KTS). Flew an ILS approach but flattened out the last 300 FT to touchdown to minimize sink rate. [We] landed on speed in the touchdown zone using autobrakes to about 50 KTS ground speed. Discussed overheat brakes or any unusual smoke or other potential problems with ARFF....none noted. ARFF followed aircraft to parking and shutdown. [We] made two entries in the logbook; LE Flaps Transit light AND Overweight landing. Note: the LE Flaps Transit light was a repeat write-up.		B737-800 flight crew experiences a LE flap transit light after flap retraction. QRH procedures do not remedy the situation and flight returns to departure airport for a partial flap landing.

The RA target indicated 200 FT below at 12 to 1 o'clock. The autopilot was disconnected and climb was initiated. ATC was advised that we were climbing and responding to an RA. ATC was very busy with much frequency congestion and did not acknowledge our transmission. Shortly after initiating the climb all TCAS information stopped. There was never any vertical speed guidance during the event other than a momentary indication on PFD and a clear of conflict message was never given. We were in visual conditions during the event and there was no visual contact with any aircraft traffic nor did we receive a TCAS TA advisory prior to the RA. After all TCAS warnings stopped a slow descent back to our original cleared altitude was started and we requested further descent from ATC and continued the approach to landing. Given the conflicting indications that we had I feel this RA was possibly a TCAS anomaly possibly from another aircraft transponder transmitting erroneous information.		During descent, we received a 'CLIMB NOW' TCAS RA which showed traffic on the NAV DISPLAY at 12 o'clock and 200 FT below. The Captain (at controls) disconnected the autopilot and initiated an immediate climb as SBGR Approach Control was advised by the First Officer that our aircraft was responding to a TCAS RA and climbing. No 'CLEAR OF CONFLICT' annunciation was heard from the TCAS system and there was no visual indication of traffic at any time during the event. SBGR Approach Control never identified any traffic in our area. There was no TA Advisory prior to the 'CLIMB NOW' TCAS RA and all TCAS indications stopped after the initial RA warning.		A B777 Crew responded to a TCAS RA from traffic at 12 o'clock 200 FT low while on approach to SBGR but the warning was apparently false and may have been a null bus fault.

A B737-700 main cabin door's bottom segment did not close completely which created a loud noise at the door after takeoff and the cabin would not pressurize so the flight returned for maintenance.

[We] checked weather with Dispatch via ACARS just prior to launch; weather above minimums. Arriving at Top of Descent (TOD) for EGE, Denver Center advised the last aircraft (business jet) to land an hour earlier reported braking action poor. That's less than our landing data would allow. Entered holding at TOD and asked Center to get an update from EGE. Advised Dispatch and asked for current field conditions. EGE Tower advised the MU readings were 49, 57, 72. Dispatch relayed same. MU equivalents were recently removed from our manuals. Asked Dispatch if they had a correlation but they didn't. [We] eventually landed uneventfully based on field reports from EGE concerning runway condition and treatment. However, the only landing report prior to my arrival was poor and the only runway friction report was based on MU values that we no longer have available. This created an airborne situation and question concerning the viability of landing at EGE. Given that we operate into the difficult environment of EGE and the airfield uses MU readings, it would seem that safe operations would require MU based evaluation data for our aircraft at EGE to reliably evaluate a safe condition for landing.		Flight was enroute to EGE when ATC advised them that braking action CFM (Continuous Friction Measurement) values were .47/.59/.71. Crew advised me this via ACARS, stated that they were in the hold, and asked if I had 'an equivalent to Good and Poor.' I had previously gotten and advised them of a field condition report, based upon a statement by the Operations Agent at EGE, of a wet runway, with a MU value of 41; I do not know where that came from (it was probably CFM information from the airport). The FOM does not reference what CFM is. I called the Tower to confirm the information, and the Controller said that she didn't have a recent reliable braking action report from an airplane. I passed this on to the flight. Then I asked Tower to have the Airport Operations Manager contact me. I talked to the gentleman, who told me that those CFM values (I later found out, via the INTERNET, that CFM means Continuous Friction Measuring) are all that they are allowed to give out. He could not state whether those were equivalent to MU values. The flight landed shortly thereafter without responding to my ACARS message. If CFM is equivalent to MU values, or ICAO standard decimal values, can this information be put in the FOM?		EGE Airport issues Runway Braking Action Reports in a CFM format but because the flight crew and Dispatch had only MU numbers they could not accurately determine the braking action until the aircraft landed.

I put the flap handle back to 5 degrees then tried flaps 10 degrees again, but the gage still read 5 degrees so I placed flap handle back to 5 degrees. I then called Approach told them we needed to break off the approach due to a flap problem. Approach vectored us north and to maintain 4,000 FT. I pulled out the QRH and went through 'Trailing Edge Flap Disagree' procedure, checked the Emergency/Abnormal landing chart, set Vref speed for five flaps and declared an emergency.

A B737-800 flight crew executed a go-around, performed the appropriate QRH procedures, declared an emergency and landed uneventfully following the failure of the flaps to extend beyond five degrees.

Passing 18,000 FT, the Captain's side of the windshield cracked suddenly accompanied by a snapping noise. The Captain took control of the aircraft, stopped the climb, directed me to request an immediate descent from Center with a turn back to [departure airport], and to declare an emergency. We received an immediate descent and vector from the Center direct [departure airport]. The spider cracks and delamination continued to expand as we made the turn and there was significant electrical arcing on the windshield. We shut off the windshield heat which was effective in stopping the arcing. Appropriate emergency and normal checklists were accomplished. Flight attendants and passengers were notified of the event and that we were returning to [departure airport]. Operations planning, FMC reprogramming, and avionics setup for the visual approach were accomplished. The controlling agencies were helpful in making room for the descent since we were so close to the field and had slowed the aircraft down. Eventually we passed souls on board and fuel once the emergency procedures were accomplished. Stable approach and landing accomplished by the Captain followed with uneventful taxi to the gate. A walk-around was accomplished and nothing was out of the ordinary, other than the windshield.				A B737-700 First Officer reported the Captain's windshield cracked and delaminated climbing out of FL180. An emergency was declared a safe return to the departure airport was accomplished.

We called the airport in sight and were cleared for the visual approach and told to contact Tower. First Officer selected direct POCIB in the FMC, and selected 4,600 FT on the MCP. When we contacted Tower, the Controller said to check altitude and stated the MVA in the area was 5,900 FT. Simultaneously we received a 'Caution Terrain, Caution Obstacle' alert from the GPWS. First Officer executed go-around maneuver. We climbed to clear the alert. Once we were clear of the hazard, we continued our descent to the runway. An s-turn to the south was needed to lose altitude. The terrain feature was in use on both navigation displays, but did not show an immediate threat in front of the airplane. The turn to POCIB was not verbalized, but I was aware of it. This turn only changed our lateral course by a couple of degrees to the right, so I did not initially think it would make a big difference, but it apparently brought us close enough laterally to terrain to trigger the alert.[We needed] verbalization of changes to FMC programming; staying on previously cleared path and altitude at night, even when cleared for a visual approach, especially in mountainous areas. Better monitoring and situational awareness on the part of the Captain/pilot not flying; not trying to salvage the approach under such conditions.		While on a descent into TUS, we had been given direct CALLS and descend to 5,000 FT. We were high on our profile due to a delayed descent. I had the speedbrakes extended and at some point in the process as we approached 5,000 FT, I extended the landing gear to slow and configure for the approach. Approach asked if we had the airport in sight and we confirmed airport in sight. Approach cleared us for the visual approach and told us to contact Tower. Once cleared for the visual, I selected POCIB in the FMC and went direct and reset the MCP altitude to 4,600 FT. The difference in heading change was less than ten degrees. We were still descending at 250 KTS with speed brake extended and gear down. When we switched to Tower, Tower said 'Check altitude, minimum vectoring in that area is 5,900 FT.' We were descending through 5,300 FT and within a few miles of POCIB. As Tower tells us this, we receive a GPWS Caution, 'Caution Obstacle Caution Terrain.' Even though it was a visual approach, it was at night so we executed the required maneuver per the FOM. We asked Tower if we could take a turn to the south to reconfigure for landing after we were clear of all terrain. The Tower approved and we landed flaps 40, exited the runway, and parked the aircraft. Captain debriefed after parking at the gate. During the event, the terrain mapping feature on the ND display never indicated terrain in front of us. It was black with terrain showing to the north. It is my opinion that had I stayed on the original clearance to CALLS at 5,000 FT or had I been on profile with a normal descent rate, we would not have received the GPWS Caution.		B737 flight crew experiences an EGPWS terrain caution just after a low altitude alert from the Tower during a night visual approach to Runway 11L at TUS. An immediate climb is initiated.

Set final altitude of 4000 MSL in altitude selector and verified by First Officer. At indicated top-of-descent point selected managed descent on autopilot and managed the speed. All crossing restrictions had been verified prior to descent. At PAYSO Intersection I noticed that we were at FL230 at 270 KIAS instead of the published FL240-FL280. Apparently the crossing restriction in the FMC had been deleted by our new cruise altitude (FL240). I had checked the crossing restrictions on the arrival prior to descending to FL240. When we descended to FL240, that altitude was added as a cruise altitude. I did not notice the restriction at PAYSO Intersection had been deleted (apparently automatically). I will be checking each crossing restriction as it comes up on the descent in addition to the normal pre-descent check of all restrictions.		Level at FL240 received clearance to descend via EAGUL 5 to 25L. Captain set 4,500 FT in FCU alt window but then pushed it. The airplane was still in cruise phase and this reset cruise alt to 24,000 thereby deleting the 24,000 minimum altitudes at PAYSO and the airplane started down. I had checked all alts in box prior to this but we did not catch the newly deleted restriction until about FL230. I then noticed problem and the Captain told Center and we were cleared to our present altitude. This has been a problem with the FMGC for years and has not been fixed.		A320 flight crew reports inadvertently deleting a crossing restriction on the EAGLE5 RNAV arrival to PHX, resulting in an early descent below the fix altitude.

We were cleared to descend via the EAGUL5 arrival into PHX, at which time the final altitude of the arrival was dialed into the window of the autopilot. Perhaps because we were starting at a lower altitude than usual for this arrival, the FMGC had eliminated the FL240 restriction at PAYSO. It was initially confusing, because the speed restriction (270) was not eliminated. I have recently had many issues with altitude restrictions not displaying properly in the new FMGC software (no ring displayed, particularly the red ring), and have attributed it to the software upgrade, though there has been no consistency from aircraft to aircraft with this anomaly. At any rate, and prior to PAYSO, the aircraft began a descent out of FL240 when it should not have. Rather than climb back up, I called ATC and got a clearance to FL220 so we could let the FMGC continue (I wanted to see what direction it would follow). Though below the 'dot', it continued down, passing FL230 when the next fix constraint was FL180-230. The descent dot showed the box to know that it was below profile the entire time. I did not let the box descend below FL220 until passing PAYSO, at which point it did continue to descend below the dot, but remained within the follow on ALT constraint at the next fix. There were no other aircraft in the area, and separation was not a factor. I am going to play with lower altitude STAR intercepts to determine what the FMGC does to handle the intercept constraints which are not below the initial STAR intercept altitude.	The reporter believes, after thinking back on the event, that a managed descent was initiated prior to reaching PAYSO.			A320 Captain cruising at FL240 and cleared to descend via the EAGLE5 RNAV arrival to PHX reports his aircraft descending of its' own volition prior to PAYSO with a minimum altitude of FL240.

(We saw the airport 30 miles out) after loading the FMS Visual I hard tuned the ILS frequency for 28R in my MCDU. While descending on the FMS Visual we armed the approach in error prior to reaching the final approach alt. realizing this I elected to hand fly the arrival and meet all crossing restrictions. At the FAF we were gear down flaps 3 and on speed. Inside SAMUL SFO Tower instructed us to sidestep to 28L, we complied. At 1,000 AGL we were flaps full on speed on vertical and lateral profile. At this point I was on the VASI for 28L, target speed plus 5 KTS. The pilot not flying informed me the ILS 28L was installed so I turned my Flight Director (FD) back on. However my FD told me to fly to 28R. I asked the pilot not flying to clear the hard tuned ILS to 28R so I might regain 28L FD info. At about 800 AGL we got a GPWS warning whoop, whoop pull up terrain pull up. I had complete confidence of our position, we were over SFO bay, short final on 28L on VASI (two red, two white) meeting all stabilized criteria, 30 miles visibility, there is no terrain 2 miles prior to 28L threshold, just bay. I knew where we were the FMGC did not. I elected to safely continue the approach and landing versus going around with a confused FMGC; landing was normal. When we parked at the gate we noticed both altimeters read -450 MSL. We have no idea how that happened both FCU altimeters were set accurately. The GPWS sounded twice when the pilot not flying removed the hard tuned 28R ILS. I had flew this aircraft on the prior leg and the FMGC failed enroute and I wrote it up, it returned to normal 5 minutes later so I canceled the write up. At first I thought we had an FMGC map shift when we got the warning until we parked and saw the altimeter error. From now on I'm not going to hard tune the ILS and correctly execute the managed approach.		[Narrative #2 had no additional information.]		A320 Captain experiences an GPWS terrain warning during visual approach to Runway 28L at SFO and continues the approach to landing. The ILS 28R had been hard tuned previously and had to be changed when cleared for Runway 28L. Both altimeters read 450 feet low at the gate.

Prior to departure I briefed the Flight Attendants about turbulence on the climb out and into DEN and that I was going to have them clean up before our descent. Ten minutes to push a maintenance issue came up and lead to an aircraft swap. Due to the delay my flight attendant briefing was now almost two hours old. With the aircraft swap everyone was busy and there were a lot of distractions with passengers who left things on the other aircraft. We were filed for FL310 to bypass the turbulence plot areas and the flight was smooth at 310. As we passed OCS (Rock Springs) we started to get light chop and requested FL290 and the ride was smooth. Thirty minutes to top of descent I called the Flight Attendant to give them a thirty minute warning prior to descent and have the cabin secured. Again at ten minutes prior to top of descent I called the Flight Attendant and told them we start down in ten minutes. At top of descent I made an announcement to the passengers that we might encounter turbulence in the descent into DEN and I was turning on the seatbelt sign. Also made the' Flight Attendant prepare cabin for arrival call at this time' announcement. Descent was smooth and the weather clear there were no adverse ride reports being broadcast by other aircraft and Approach Control did not mention any ride reports -also Approach deleted the speed restriction at RAMMS intersection on the arrival. We were also notified the ATIS had changed and told us to pick up the new ATIS and advise. I put that off until workload permitted. Approaching FL190 I gave the double chime. Approaching RAMMS the Controller cleared us to 130 all checklist were complete and I went heads down to get the ATIS off ACARS - it came back as digital ATIS unavailable so I tried it again same thing. As I was looking up the ATIS frequency to dial it in we were passing 150. In a matter of four to five seconds we went from smooth to severe turbulence. First Officer went to a wings level attitude and was pulling power back as airspeed was increasing I saw the green acceleration bar heading for the barber pole so I extended the speed brakes to add drag and stop the acceleration (the First Officer had his hands full flying the aircraft). We exceeded barber pole by about five knots for approximately three to four seconds - we were in clean configuration; severe turbulence lasted for thirty to fourty seconds. We did not feel that we exceeded G limits. Reported Severe Turbulence to ATC - he then cleared us to 110. Out of 130 the severe subsided to moderate and smoothed out at 110. The rest of the arrival and approach was smooth. Once the ride smoothed out I called back to the Flight Attendant to see if we had any injuries - at that time I heard that one of them had hurt her arm. I called Operations to have them notify paramedics to meet the aircraft. I did not declare an emergency or ask for priority handling as we were already on down wind and were number one for the approach - we were on the ground shortly there after. On block in the paramedics took care of the injured Flight Attendant. No passengers were hurt. I contacted Dispatch, Maintenance Control and the Duty Officer and we had a conference call. Appropriate log book entries were made and I debriefed the mechanic who met the aircraft. As I reflect back on this event and what could we have done differently and what were the events that led up to this. If I had to point to one common thread it was creeping fatigue. I tied together two other ASAP reports as they warranted separate write-ups but they contributed to the chain of events. 1. I was surprised that the flight attendants were still doing a final walk through I had assumed that the cabin was all secure. But I also now realize that we started our descent from 290 instead of the usual 370 or higher. Based on standard rates of descent we were into the severe approximately five to seven minutes after the descent began. So I have to ask myself did my instructions match the intentions. When told to have the cabin picked up and secured for descent I assumed they would be seated. This points to careful choice of words. 2. I could have been more pro active with Approach about rides. Since there were no complaints on frequency and the Controller did not mention rides, and deleted the speed restriction at RAMMS, I assumed the rides would be OK. The paper work had turbulence forecast but all were up high and there was one that was down low but it expired a couple hours before our arrival and the smooth descent seemed to be playing that out. I recognize now that assuming and not being proactive are subtle signs of fatigue in myself. Our flight attendants did a great job and were very professional. We were over nine hours on duty before leaving for DEN. We were scheduled for eight hours of flying that day.				A B737 encountered severe turbulence passing 15,000 FT during descent into DEN causing injuries to flight attendants.

Bump was suggestive of wake turbulence (perpendicular track) versus a weather phenomenon. Smooth air was experienced for a few minutes prior and a few minutes after. The greater area was described as containing occasional light chop (by other aircraft relayed by ATC), but seat belt signs were on mostly due to recent light chop experienced combined with earlier reports of moderate chop west of DTA. All passengers were seated. Our flight attendants were aware of earlier ride reports in region, but had been updated by me of more recent and local light chop reports. Approximately [an hour and a half later] I was informed by our First Flight Attendant that both flight attendants in the rear of the airplane had been injured during that event. She had been informed immediately and I believe that all thought that the other party had informed the cockpit.[One of the flight attendants reportedly] descended to her knees. [She] described a strained or stiff back and a bruised knee. [Another flight attendant] was in the aft cabin and describes bruising her elbow as she caught her balance. I became aware of injuries as meals were passed to the cockpit and during a lavatory break. We had not been called previously, nor had it been discussed during a call for cabin temperature or for meals to be prepared. It was obvious that [one of the flight attendants] was in pain, but she did walk to the forward cabin to speak to me during my break. Our Dispatcher was informed immediately after we collected the necessary information. An in-flight Supervisor was requested and we were met at the gate on arrival. The cockpit was informed within ten minutes of the top-of-descent that [the injured Flight Attendant] would occupy a passenger seat for landing due to injury. A Law Enforcement Officer was identified at that time as an able bodied helper if one was needed for an evacuation.		We encountered momentary moderate turbulence that lasted approximately 2 seconds. It felt like classic wake turbulence because it stopped as fast as it started. Their was no aircraft that [we] suspected of causing the wake although we were in trail of another aircraft prior to encounter that was above our altitude and 15 NM ahead.		An A320 flight crew reported a wake turbulence encounter that caused minor injuries to two flight attendants.

Just prior to taxi, Ground Control changed our departure altitude from 5,000 FT to 3,000 FT. After that change, we were cleared to taxi via Charlie to 13R and cross Runway 18. When the First Officer switched over to the Tower frequency, we heard the Tower give a windshear report of minus 20 KTS. I had the First Officer recalculate our takeoff data using the Windshear button on the performance computer, while I stopped the aircraft and set the brake. When the First Officer gave me the performance date, I began to brief a precautionary takeoff and repositioned the flaps from our original flaps one setting, to flaps five. I was just completing the briefing of the new V speeds and flap setting when the Tower cleared us to 'line up and wait.' The tapes revealed that the First Officer properly read back the clearance. After the Tower cleared us to 'line up and wait,' there was a slight delay because we still had to complete the Before Takeoff Checklist. During this short lapse of time to perform the checklist, our understanding of the clearance somehow failed. We incorrectly took off when our clearance was to 'line up and wait'. Although we had some last minute weather and tasks to deal with, I thought they were manageable. I am perplexed as to how the breakdown happened. We both heard the clearance, yet we misinterpreted the clearance after the six seconds it took to complete the checklist. The change I would make in the future is to be more cognizant of being saturated. Although we completed all the last minute tasks, we didn't fully absorb the communication from the Tower.		I believe that the reason behind the misunderstanding was that I was too concerned with the weather/windshear/precautionary takeoff. Another contributing factor was the fact that Tower called us while we were preparing for the precautionary takeoff. Since there was no other traffic (landing or takeoff), I was expecting a takeoff clearance. I rushed to respond to the Tower and heard what I wanted to hear instead of what Tower actually said. This is a big lesson for me. I can't believe that I let us take off without a takeoff clearance. But I did! The big lessons are: I need to slow down and be more deliberate, especially when I encounter adverse weather and/or something different.		A B737 crew became distracted while discussing the windshear takeoff performance calculations at the same time ATC issued a line up and wait clearance and so took off without clearance.

We descended at 2,500 FPM and I did not want to be high and behind during the arrival, which had many step down fixes. About FL210 I gave the jet to the First Officer while I switched to the PA to address the passengers. This took a couple of minutes at most. At this point, my attention was divided between the PA the descent profile. We were still descending in VERT SPD at 2,500 FPM and I assumed the First Officer was monitoring crossing restrictions and would reduce the rate of descent or return to VNAV Path or VERT SPD, if needed. He did not. When I resumed flying the aircraft I noticed we were low on the profile and stopped the descent at 17,200 FT to determine our location and altitude. At this point we were crossing SKIPY Intersection on the KORRY 3. The crossing restriction was FL190 and we were almost 2,000 FT low. Yikes! Within 10 miles we were back on profile, crossing BESSI at 17,000 FT. I had not flown with the First Officer before this flight. Typically, I will tell the First Officer that while I'm off the command radio to point to the heading, airspeed, altitude, FMS, or radio frequency if a change occurs. I will then roger the change with a 'thumbs up' so he is aware I am aware of any changes. None occurred and I assumed he was watching the rate of descent. Automation can be a good thing or a bad thing. In this instance, it bit us. It's easy to get complacent and assume everything is working properly. I always use the arrival chart for the descent and cross check the ND and crossing restrictions, even to the point of calling them out to the First Officer so we're both crosschecking the automation. I have to blame myself for not re-emphasizing the fact we were in VERT SPD mode for the descent, even though I announced it and pointed to the FMA on the PFD when this mode was selected. Although I was watching the progress of the flight on the ND, I did not reduce the scale enough to clearly show all of the descent points. I therefore missed the fact we were low at SKIPY until it was too late. In the future, I will re-emphasize the VERT SPD Mode to the First Officer if it is in use for a descent and make certain he knows that while flying the aircraft, he is supposed to insure all crossing restrictions are complied with. Ultimately, what we had was a breakdown in CRM. It can and does happen. And, we're both responsible, but ultimately, as the Captain, the blame falls squarely on my shoulders. This should not have happened. Despite being careful and precise, I missed a restriction due to a strong tail wind, using a mode (VERT SPD) that requires constant vigilance, and being out of the loop at the wrong phase of flight.				A B737 Captain gave his First Officer aircraft control while he made a PA and the First Officer failed to monitor the aircraft's descent. They were 2,000 FT low crossing a KORRY 3 arrival constraint.

We performed a go-around, referred to flight manual for ECAM, completed appropriate checklists, and determined that since the ECAM was NOT combined with a shock absorber fault that the nose wheel was in a normal position aligned with the runway. We declared an emergency, notified Dispatch via ACARS. I advised the flight attendants of the situation and that we were not planning an evacuation. I initially informed passengers via PA that we had gone around for an indication that necessitated the go around. Subsequently I briefed them that there would be emergency equipment approaching the aircraft after landing and that we had an indication of a problem that may inhibit our ability to taxi after landing (something to that effect, I don't recall the specific wording). We landed uneventfully and cleared the runway on the high speed taxiway. We stopped the aircraft and made contact with fire and rescue. We then performed the Flight Manual prescribed system reset for the fault. Nose wheel steering returned to normal indications and we proceeded to the gate once fire and rescue were notified and clear. After landing I contacted both Dispatch and the Flight Manager via telephone to update them. A couple of items of note: 1) The Flight Manager indicated to me that operations was under the impression we had performed a 'fly-by.' We did NOT do a fly by; we only did a go-around in order to have time to analyze the situation and appropriately deal with the problem. Tower did re-assign us from 1C to 1R for landing. 2) Upon parking at the gate, as soon as the door opened there was a Customer Service Supervisor, CS Agent, Flight Attendant Supervisor, 2 Mechanics and an Assistant Chief Pilot that all entered the plane before the people had even exited. While we appreciated the show of support it was distracting and disruptive. The Flight Attendant supervisor immediately wanted to know if the flight attendants were OK to continue. I had not even had time to de-brief the crew and would have appreciated everyone waiting until we had deplaned. We had also had a minor medical issue on the same flight. I wanted to thank the Doctor onboard that had assisted and speak to the woman he (and med-link) had assisted. We did all debrief as a crew once we had deplaned.		[Narrative #2 has no additional information.]		An A320 ECAM alerted WHEEL N/W STRG FAULT when the landing gear were extended, so a go around was executed to comply with the QRH, an emergency declared and a normal landing completed followed by a steering fault reset which allowed a normal taxi to the gate.

When cleared out of 14,000 FT, our ALTITUDE SELECTOR DISPLAY on the MODE CONTROL PANEL got stuck and displayed '50,000' while we were trying to set it to the new ATC assigned altitude. However, we determined that we could continue to our destination since we were able to manually maintain any chosen altitude. We advised Departure of our situation and expressed concerns about RVSM. The Controller checked and informed us that we were cleared to continue to our destination in RVSM airspace since we were able to maintain altitude. We also advised Company Dispatch and Maintenance. We endured the aural ALTITUDE ALERT which chimed every 10 seconds. We asked if we could pull the CIRCUIT BREAKER to silence it, but Maintenance would not allow it. Although VERTICAL NAVIGATION MODE worked in cruise, as expected, when we initiated our descent we lost numerous VERTICAL NAVIGATION MODE capabilities. These included normal descent planning tools such as the following: 1. V-NAV path; 2. The Top of Descent symbol (T/D) on the NAV display unit; 3. The Altitude Range Arc on the NAV display unit; and 4. The WAYPOINT/ALTITUDE VERTICAL BEARING display guidance on the CDU unit V-NAV descent page. We descended using VERTICAL/SPEED, our lowest mode of automation. We leveled off at Flight Level 340 as requested by Center. About 60 miles out they asked us to cross a fix on the arrival at 12,000 FT and 250 KTS. We calculated incorrectly and started down at 35 miles away from our crossing fix. This caused us to cross around 10,000 FT too high. Although we informed Approach Control he did not respond but cleared us down to 6,000 FT. Near the end of our descent, at around 14,000 FT, the challenge disappeared and we were able to accomplish a stable uneventful approach and landing. To prevent such an error in the future I would: 1. Silence the Altitude Alerter; 2. Review calculation of 3 degree manual descent profiles.		Climbing through 14,000 FT (clearance level was FL400), the pilot flying was spinning the altitude selector knob to 40,000 with B/AP engaged, the altitude selector inexplicably showed 50,000 (FL500), and was stuck in that position. We were unable to change the altitude selection window from this 50,000 value. We also agreed the cruise ALT set in the FMS would hold the required clearance level of FL400. With this condition however, the altitude alerter sounds every 10 seconds throughout the entire flight, that's approximately 1080 altitude 'bongs' for a three hour flight.While discussing the descent and landing we agreed that by selecting a lower altitude in the FMS, and using Altitude intervention and Vertical Speed Mode, we could effectively descend the airplane. In this mode of operation however, we lost most of our normal tools to control a descent.Descending through 14,000 the situation with the altitude selector corrected itself and a normal landing took place. Contributing factors included a relatively late crossing restriction clearance by ATC; distraction from the altitude alerter every 10 seconds for the previous three hours, and the time of day--nearly midnight.		When the altitude alert display stuck at 50,000 FT on initial climbout the flight crew of a B737-700 decided to continue the flight using FMS cruise altitude programming to maintain altitude in cruise and utilizing Vertical Speed Mode for the descent. When given a crossing altitude restriction on their descent they miscalculated the required Top of Descent point and crossed the restricted fix 10,000 FT high.

On the CFM-56 Fan Line Work Card, there are multiple items accomplished with several different mechanics accomplishing them. There is only one sign-off for all the work. What happened was an oil line was installed with a cap still attached. The engine ran across [numerous] tests without a problem. The CFM-56 engine was installed on a B737-800 aircraft and within forty minutes into the flight, lost all its oil and oil pressure. Caps will not be used in shop on lines.

Push-in type, end cap seals are inserted into the ends of oil lines to keep dirt and debris out of the lines. But they can be hard to see at times and that's exactly what happened. The engine passed a two-hour Engine Test Cell Run that included a Field Break-in Run, a High-Power Run and another engine run after the CFM-56 was mounted to the wing of their B737-800 aircraft. The center of the push-in type seal finally disintegrated in flight, shortly after departure. That type of seal will not be used in the future.			An Engine Shop Mechanic reports about a CFM-56 engine that lost all oil quantity and oil pressure shortly after takeoff requiring an In-Flight Shutdown.

I deemed ZZZ the nearest suitable for landing, declared an emergency for priority handling and landed. I commend my First Officer for his outstanding assistance during this event. In the future, I will consider day/night and weather considerations before accepting an aircraft with a deferred generator. There should be weather minima associated with the placarding of a generator to prevent this from occurring again.				When dispatched with one generator inoperative the flight crew of a B737-800 was forced to divert to their nearest suitable airport when the APU, required to be operative to provide a secondary electrical power source, failed enroute.

The aircraft had the left generator placarded inoperative, and the APU was the 'second' generator per the MEL. After departing, approximately halfway to our destination, in cruise, the APU lost oil pressure and automatically shutdown. After consulting the QRH, the Captain declared an emergency as we were now down to one generator, night IMC, wintertime conditions. Checking weather at the nearest airports, we determined that the weather was not suitable for our condition, and we were seeking a VFR, if at least marginally VFR airport. After checking several airports, we decided on an airport we had just passed with 4 miles visibility, 1,000 FT, 11,900 FT runway, braking action good. The Captain did a great job working the QRH and normal checklists, and managing the flight deck as we flew to our divert airport. We discussed the possibility of the remaining generator failing, and then him performing the 'battery only' approach and landing. Fortunately, the remaining generator did not fail, and we landed uneventfully. This flight was my second emergency landing in less than two months. Both emergencies occurred from items that were previous write-ups in the logbook or placarded MEL items of important systems. In the case of this event, my only suggestion is that placarding a generator inoperative, with APU having a prior recent history for shutting down to low oil pressure (or any reason/history in the logbook), especially wintertime, is a bad idea. This was a 'learning experience' for me, and will guide my decision making in the future. This event is a good example of an emergency being entirely preventable.				A B737-800 was dispatched with an engine generator on MEL and an APU with a history of low oil pressure auto shutdowns. While inflight the APU auto shutdown causing the crew to declare an emergency and divert single generator to a nearby airport with suitable weather.

The traffic was slightly off the left side of our aircraft. The Captain called 'in sight' and I continued the approach exactly on glide slope. Inside of 2,000 FT AGL, I lessened the vertical descent since the VFR traffic appeared like it was going to fly directly underneath us. At approximately 1,400 FT AGL, we received an RA to 'Adjust Vertical Speed' and I acted accordingly. After a slight level off, the conflict was resolved and I continued the stable approach to a landing. I would estimate the traffic passed underneath of our aircraft by approximately 400 FT. Although Tower confirmed the VFR traffic was operating in appropriate airspace, it doesn't seem to be a good idea for a Banner Tow to be at 1,000 FT AGL three to four miles from the approach end of an active runway.		The weather was VMC at the time of the challenge. We were cleared for the ILS 9L (FLL). I was acting as the pilot not flying. FLL Local called traffic (a Banner Tow aircraft at 1000' MSL) slightly north of the final tracking south. As I understand it and later confirmed the Banner Tow aircraft was just outside C Airspace, but very close to, if not in, Class D airspace. I found the traffic when we were approximately 1,300 FT MSL on the glide slope. The TCAS fired shortly thereafter with a 'Traffic/Traffic, Adjust Vertical Descent ... Adjust.' You can well imagine it got a bit hectic as were trying to respond to the RA call and maintain situational awareness on the airplane that was doing a fly under maneuver. I find it odd (but curiously legal) how FLL Local permitted a Banner Tow aircraft within 300 FT of our three degree glide to 9L. Supposedly the Banner Tow aircraft  sight, but I believe safety was degraded by allowing a minimal separation on an ILS. The First Officer acted properly and promptly and the landing was uneventful. I had what I believe was a cordial exchange with the Local Controller regarding the wisdom of permitting such a situation to develop in the first place.		B737 flight crew experiences a TCAS RA during approach to Runway 9L at FLL at 1,300 FT caused by a banner tow aircraft passing under the glide path at 1,000 FT.

Maintenance deferred the first ECAM with MEL 32-42-03 BSCU 1 inoperative. That deferral makes a reference to the autobrake panel mode lights being inoperative and has a note FOR BSCU CHANNEL/SYSTEM 1 INOPERATIVE REFER TO MEL FOR AUTO/BRK PANEL MODE LIGHTS DEFERRAL. Maintenance took that reference and used it to defer the second ECAM listed above (MEL 32-42-04). In my review of the MEL, once on board, I did not question the linking of the second ECAM to the first ECAM MEL, guidance that was made by Maintenance. I ASSUMED that Maintenance had specific guidance that the second ECAM was a result of the loss of BSCU 1 and the autobrake panel lights, nothing more complex that had to be evaluated for compound failures. We complied with all MEL restrictions prior to departure to include verifying that the autobrakes were armed on the wheels SD page. Checking recall prior to departure only brought up the first ECAM. No autobrake ECAM or status messages were present. This furthered my belief that the maintenance issues had been addressed correctly. Taxi, takeoff and initial climb were normal. Nearing FL350 we received the same autobrake fault ECAM received by the first crew. We complied with the Irregular Procedure. We determined that we had lost normal brakes but did have antiskid. Further review of the Flight Manual to include the system resets section made it apparent to me that the autobrakes ECAM, while obviously related to the brake system fault ECAM, was not linked to it as a secondary failure due to the lights failure. We had two separate failures, as did the inbound flight that should have been treated as such. The maintenance dispatch was improper/illegal. Trust but VERIFY everything! Careful verification of maintenance actions could have prevented this.		Illegal dispatch; the aircraft was dispatched with a BSCU channel 1 fault, along with the annunciator lights for the autobrakes inoperative. In fact the autobrakes and the BSCU 1 were written up on the inbound flight and Maintenance interpreted the autobrake fault as just an annunciator light issue. The plane should have been dispatched with an autobrake fault and BSCU channel 1 fault. Enroute we ran the autobrake fault ECAM, contacted Dispatch and Maintenance and continued to destination.		A320 flight crew experiences an autobrake fault in cruise after the fault had been previously written up and diagnosed as an autobrake panel light fault and MELed as such. BSCU 1 was also MELed separately. Flight continues to destination.

Upon calling for gear down flaps 15 the flap indicator did not move from flaps 10. We called for a go around, declared an emergency and asked for a heading towards a nearby airport with longer runways. We then ran the 'TRAILING EDGE FLAP DISAGREE' Checklist and, upon completion, landed on the longest runway at the nearby airport.Fuel on board [FOB] was approximately 4,900 LBS at the initiation of the go around.  FOB at touch down was approximately 3.0 and 2.7 at the gate. Both fuel quantity indicators were amber shortly after completion of the checklist. In hindsight we should have declared a fuel emergency and we forgot (did not have time) to contact Dispatch about the diversion. I also momentarily misinterpreted the fuel in minutes when I relayed it to ATC. The First Officer actually relayed more accurate information. The checklist seemed convoluted and took too long to run properly in a low fuel situation. For only three items to be actually done, flap inhibit switch, alternate flap switch, and extend flaps with electrical switch it should take about 45 seconds. I did miss a step in that I did not put the flap handle to 15. We burned up a considerable amount of fuel just determining which of the checklist items to run. We did not have enough fuel on board at touch down to do a go around and landing. I realized after I left the airport that I had neglected to contact Dispatch.Our fuel consideration was immediate and overshadowed the entire event. It made it hard to concentrate on the task at hand and split our attention. We also should not have allowed ourselves to be vectored so far from our divert airport. ATC was very concerned about fuel and souls on board and continually made calls to us, which was very distracting. I asked them to stop calling us while we ran the checklist. I should have informed them more accurately and sooner about our fuel situation.		After having requested flaps '10' I noticed a split between the left and right flaps of approximately 3 degrees. While beginning to look into the split flap indication the gauge suddenly corrected itself to a normal flap indication. Assuming the problem to have been just a temporary flap gauge indication problem we continued to configure for landing. Upon requesting gear down and flaps to 15 degrees ... we did not get any additional flaps with the request.I know in these hard economic times it's hard for the 'company' to justify carrying fuel above and beyond the minimum reserves. Our Emergency/diversion was as text book as it could have been for a divert of this magnitude yet we landed with 2,700 LBS of fuel which is too close to 'ZERO'!  I know we can't plan for every scenario but the minimum reserves for this aircraft have to be increased!		A B737-NG's diversion from the short runways at their planned destination to the longer ones at a nearby airport due to a failure of the flaps to extend was complicated by the minimum legal fuel reserves boarded for the flight.

We were never assigned a departure; a first for me out of LAX. We were given heading 250. Radar vector to EXERT V-25 RZS as filed. We were climbing between 8,000 to 9,000 FT and on the heading of 250 for quite a ways. Finally SoCal Departure cleared us direct 'HECTOR and contact Center on (I thought) 125.5.' I read my clearance back as direct HECTOR and the frequency 125.5. I found that after I read back the clearance to direct HECTOR, that it was odd, since it was not on our route. Both of us heard it as direct HECTOR (HEC). I figured I can ask the next Controller for clarification. I switched over to check in with Center frequency 125.5 quickly came back, 'you have the wrong frequency and check back with your previous frequency.' While this was going on, the Captain (who was hand flying, not on autopilot), decided to type in the fix for direct HEC on his own and started to make a quick right turn to HECTOR (which was about 020 degrees heading from our position.) I said, 'What are you doing?!' Captain said, I am turning direct Hector. (As per company procedures, since he was hand flying, I am supposed to put in the fix and he is supposed to verify it is correct, and then I click ENTER and LNAV direct.' By me quickly asking him, we stopped on the heading of 300 degrees or so. I quickly then switched back to the original frequency, and immediately asked SoCal, 'Do you really want us to fly to direct HECTOR?' He said, 'No. Direct EXERT.' (We both heard him say Hector.) So I punched in EXERT, after I verified with the Captain it was entered properly in the FMC (which was pretty much west from our present position), and then asked again for the proper frequency. He told us, 135.5. He did not sound upset. No aircraft was near us. All of this happened very fast. If the Captain had used proper procedures, this would not have happened. I was distracted, trying to watch him 'hand fly' the jet, making sure he did not mess up. I wish I had asked SoCal Departure, why direct HECTOR or something like that. But I knew it was in the area, and sometimes controllers change their minds and have you go some other route. If the Captain had told me he put in HECTOR, I could have said, wait; let me call for sure to see if this is correct. But he kept me out of his loop. It is scary how fast things can get messed up on a relatively easy.				B737 First Officer describes a misunderstood clearance from Departure Control that results in a track deviation when the Captain enters and turns toward the fix before the First Officer can verify the route with the next Controller.

While at 8,000 FT MSL, another aircraft was vectored over us at approximately 8,500 FT. ATC did not call out the traffic to us. We received an RA 'Descend Now' Advisory. I complied with the advisory and started a 2,000 FPM descent into the green arc on the VSI. I descended to approximately 7,600 FT and the Resolution Advisory ceased. We informed ATC of the event and then climbed back up to our assigned altitude. We believe the other aircraft's descent rate caused our system to trigger the RA.		Prior to our departure from ATL, Tower changed our altitude clearance from 10,000 FT to 8,000 FT without explanation. Departure Control also verified that our clearance was 8,000 FT. As we leveled at 8,000 FT, we received first a caution, then a descend command from our TCAS to which the First Officer, as the pilot flying, responded. I called our TCAS directed descent to Departure and they responded with a traffic callout of VFR traffic at 8,500 FT. When the TCAS reported 'Clear of Conflict,' we returned to 8,000 FT.I have never seen 500 FT of separation in level flight not cause a TCAS RA. 500 FT of separation satisfies everything except the TCAS. Controllers should be made aware of this issue, and the TCAS logic that requires an RA in this situation should be re-examined. In the interim, pilots should continue to respond to the RA as we have been trained.		B737 flight crew leveling at 8,000 FT experiences a TCAS RA due to VFR traffic at 8,500 FT and descends.

I had an early report time, which for me is a cross town assignment making for a long drive and a very early get up to deal with traffic associated with [the area]. Looking at the trip a week or so prior to departure, I cringed at how long of a day it was going to be especially having to fly and receive training and checking after a dead head in the cabin of a full aircraft. While legal, I know of no pilot who considers dead heading in the cabin of full aircraft restful in any respect. I got to TNCM already tired. I felt like I had been put in a box by scheduling and had expressed my concerns with my Chief pilot about this trip a few days prior; asking him, 'Why are we building training like this?' This was not an operational necessity, it was a choice made by the line check desk to have me trained under these conditions. I contemplated declaring myself fatigued in TNCM but I felt tremendous pressure to fly the flight. I knew if I did not operate the flight we would have 150 stranded passengers and the flight would cancel. I also knew that I would have to deal with a ration of phone calls and perhaps even threats of discipline if I canceled the flight. I told my Check Airman that I was dead tired and he, coming off of a 25 hour TNCM layover, agreed with me; stating that this was a poor way to schedule training and that in his opinion a flying leg down with a layover and a flying leg out was the correct way for a pilot to see both the entry and exit into TNCM (which can be challenging) and to receive the Class II Training. We were planned at max gross, every seat full, taking off from TNCM, with a planned landing fuel of 5.9 LBS. While I was very tired, we had an uneventful flight up to the East Coast, flying the planned profile altitudes and cruise speeds. ATC had us descend nearly 200 miles from destination and with the over burn due to heavier than forecast head winds, fuel started to become an issue. New York ATC vectoring into sequence compounded the over burn issue and we declared 'Minimum Fuel.' We were eventually vectored onto the final just as a rain storm was rolling onto the field. We picked up heavy precipitation at approximately 500 FT AGL and with the fuel at 3.8; I thought to myself, this is going to be a very bad situation if we have to go around for wind shear now. We made an uneventful landing but I recall my heart beating in my chest rather rapidly for the last 15 minutes of the flight due to the fuel situation, weather and the countless cups of coffee I was forced to drink throughout the day to overcome the fatiguing nature of this training assignment. I recall thinking to myself while waiting in line to clear customs that this assignment had red flags all over it prior to it beginning. With 25+ years of military and civilian aviation experience, I saw the potential difficulties prior to beginning the assignment and even voiced my concerns to my Chief pilot with the complaints being answered with 'nothing I can really do for you, it's all legal.' Every mishap happens with a chain of events that proceeds it and while this situation ended normally, I walked off that aircraft absolutely spent and had difficulty sleeping again that night thinking about the 'what ifs.' By the time I left the airport I had been on the property for over 13 hours, had over 8.5 hours of combined dead head and flight time and had not slept for 17+ hours. It was one of the longest and most stressful days I have had flying in a long time and again this was not part of some irregular operation; this was scheduled training. Note: The Check Airman who conducted the training was both fair and competent, and while the day was a completely negative experience by the nature of the schedule, theCheck Airman did his duties in a professional manner considering the circumstances.				A320 Captain describes a fatiguing training/line check scenario beginning with a long drive for an early check in to deadhead to TNCM. Training/checking occurs on the return leg ending with a low fuel declaration and landing in a down pour.

I've been to [this airport] many times, but never at night. I planned a flaps 40 visual to Runway 2L, backed up by the ILS. In retrospect, I should have planned the ILS backed up by the visual. Cleared at pilot's discretion to 8,000 FT, 150 miles east of the airport; normal descent; cleared to 6,000 FT then 4,000 FT, direct to [the Initial Approach Fix]. Once I was 'sure' I had the runway, I had [the First Officer] ask for the visual. Cleared to descend to 2,000 FT; cleared visual. Now at this point I, evidently smarter than everyone else, decide to go Heading Select and cut just inside the IAF. I'm already a little low because, like an idiot, I am thinking [the airport] is sea level, not 400-plus FT. So we are out of 2,000 FT, throw the gear down, run the landing check, and I am making a slow turn to the runway; or so I thought. Well, I was turning, but looking at Runway 2R. The VASI is red/red which isn't jiving with the ILS for 2L at this point. I realize I am looking at the wrong runway with some help from [the First Officer], who is a great pilot, and make a correction to the left (it wasn't radical as we were still a couple of miles out). Finally it dawns on me that I am low so I add power and essentially level off. Now mind you, I've only been flying big jets for about 35 years now; you'd think I'd realized that if I level off with flaps 40 it will take a lot of power. So to keep it interesting, I add what I think is enough power, of course still concentrating on getting over to centerline and glide slope. I was about a dot-and-a-half low. Ref speed was 132 KTS. [The First Officer] reminded me of that at 130 KTS and I pushed the power up. He re-reminded me of that at 127 KTS and I pushed the power up a lot as I finally realized that I was essentially level going back to the glide slope. Speed came back up to 140 then 145 KTS (of course). Now I'm maybe 500 FT AGL, back on glide slope and in the slot, pulling the power back a bit because we actually get to descend now...uneventful touchdown and rollout. Moral of the story: 1) keep hiring people like [the First Officer]. 2) At night,… always fly the ILS if there is one and I swear it doesn't matter if you have been there one time or one thousand times, night is different. Your eagle eyes are not near as much help to you as that panel in front of you. Two minutes extra is worth it for the aging process. Flying the ILS eliminates the need for estimating the turn to final, debating which runway you are going to, etc. If there is no ILS then there is some electronic guide you can use. Pick a safe altitude to start it and follow it to the runway. I learned this same lesson like 25 years ago at DCA, but evidently I left that lesson in some other part of my brain last night. Pass this on: being low and slow and not on the localizer or glide path at night is very disconcerting. You are completely out of your element and your brain is racing to fix it, but you don't look at the right stuff. An excellent First Officer picks up on that and feeds the info that, for whatever reason, you aren't getting.Everyone can learn from this. Restating the obvious is essential, but some people like me don't seem to get it every time. Events in my career have not occurred with malfunctions or weather, usually. They happen on nights like last night, where everything is even better than normal so you think you'll be Sky King and do the perfect visual and landing. I, for one, just got another wake up call.				B737-800 Captain recounts the difficulties encountered in performing a night visual approach with ILS backup and advises that the reverse, an ILS approach backed up by the visual, is a far better practice.

This extended our touchdown in the touchdown zone. We were in reverse and slowing when ATC told us to exit and turn right onto Kilo to the gate. I advised them that we missed the right 90 turnoff and ATC advised us to hurry down to the next right turnoff which turned out to be K5. We kept our speed up on the runway and were slowing to try to hurry and exit at K5 for traffic on final. At this time we were given taxi instructions again. The clearance was right on Kilo and hold short of Tango. I answered as we were distracted by slowing in a hurry to turn off. I answered to turn right on Kilo like our first taxi instructions, but I am not sure if I acknowledged the hold short. As we taxied up to the parallel Kilo we saw [the other aircraft] landing and exiting on the high speed. We were short of the high speed and just slowing for [the other aircraft] to exit when ATC told us we were supposed to hold short of Tango. I looked to the left and saw the K4 taxi sign coming up. I knew we had to stop for [the other aircraft] to exit and I guess I thought that the high speed was Tango, not Kilo 4. [The other aircraft] was told to taxi to parking in front of us and then ATC advised us to taxi to parking. We taxied to the gate and we noticed I had forgotten the flaps in my after landing flow due to the hurried exit and answering ATC. The combination of the hurry to exit and answering ATC at the same time probably led to the confusion.		We encountered some wake turbulence (air was completely smooth until the last 50 FT). This did have [some] effect on the landing performance. We did land in the touchdown zone but further rather than closer to the approach end of the runway.		An A320 flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence just before touchdown at PHL behind a B757 that extended their touchdown point and caused some issues with ATC.

We were being held down for traffic. When that traffic passed overhead we were cleared to climb to FL190 and switched to Washington Center. The Captain dialed in what I thought was 190 on the MCP and then dialed in the frequency on the radio because his hand was closest. I do not remember repeating '190' when he removed his hand from the MCP, but it is a procedure and habit I do regularly.There was a lot of chatter on the frequency so I waited to check in on the frequency until it quieted down. I leaned forward to check the out and off times from the FMC. At that time, we were approaching FL180, so we set 29.92 in the altimeters. I wrote down the times. Then, Center called us to see if we were on frequency yet. I responded that we were 'passing 190 for 290' as I looked at the altitude window on the MCP. Center responded that we were only cleared to 190, but it was 'no big deal' because there were no other aircraft above us. Then, he cleared us to climb to FL260. When Center called us, we were passing 19.2.		When finally given a climb and normal speed, I thought the Controller said FL290 versus FL190. It seemed odd to get that much climb from Washington Center all at once, but my pilot not flying seemed to accept it...Although not a particularly difficult day, I think both the First Officer and I let down our guard at the same time. He missed my mistake and I did not pursue verification on a clearance that seemed a little out of place.If something does not seem right--even by a little bit--pursue verification from the other crew member and then ATC. An old lesson relearned.		A B737-700 flight crew failed to follow SOP to verify confirmation of a clearance to a higher altitude. As they passed through FL190 for 290 ATC advised they had only been cleared to 190. They were then cleared to climb to FL270.

We waited about 25 minutes to depart and the winds were slightly stronger than forecast at cruise. Approximately 120 miles, showing landing fuel of 4.6, we are told to expect 18 minutes of holding due to high winds. We immediately got the plan going to divert with Dispatch via ACARS, which we employ shortly with ATC and were let down into COS. COS is busy but uneventful as we coordinate for all required to divert and land off-station. Winds on TAF for Springs were forecast to pick up and become gusty out of the northwest at our arrival time and they did just that. LLWS was on ATIS and was briefed with appropriate speeds at Ref + 18. Fully configured and about 1,200 FT-1,500 FT AGL, we get a full Windshear Warning with a 'go around' command. The First Officer and I quickly analyze the situation, our fuel, long length of the planned runway, current flight parameters, probability that the LLWS condition is going to stay and probably increase based on the forecast, current fuel insufficient to fly to DEN, which has the same conditions and more traffic, and the fuel state we would have after a lap around the patch with likely the same conditions to greet us on final, and elected to continue with the option of a go-around if the situation warrants. We were going to have to land at COS as I did not see any other viable alternative given our situation. We had talked about most of these considerations prior to our approach. The ride down final was turbulent but controllable with +/- 10 KTS airspeed, slight pitch, roll and yaw oscillations. The conditions were not as pronounced as those we encounter in our simulator windshear training. Touchdown was slightly long and, after normal braking, we turned off around 5,000 FT of runway remaining. We shut down on the ramp with 4.1 on the gas. More fuel, it's too long of a flight to not have a bit more of a cushion. I should have questioned this more. The DEN weather was VFR, but I didn't fully consider the implications of the wind and possibility of delays.		[We] took off at minimum takeoff fuel. Top of Climb winds were higher than planned and enroute winds were higher than planned. [We] showed arrival fuel for Runway 26 at 4.6. Then, we were told to plan on holding at Denver due to winds. We emailed Dispatch and told them we had no fuel to hold. Received and acknowledged a divert plan. COS winds at the time were calm with TAF winds getting bad, gusting in our arrival time frame. COS winds on TAF showed they would get worse, not better. COS Approach and Tower were reporting many windshear alerts from the time we checked in. We planned on an approach to 35L and the system showed our arrival fuel at 4.1. Inside the FAF, we received a Windshear Warning from the northwest quadrant. It was a momentary warning but we both know we were supposed to go around. We elected to continue the approach and go around if conditions warranted since we would be at emergency fuel and have to shoot the same approach again to the same runway anyway. Landing was bumpy but uneventful. We shut down with 4.1. After landing, in addition to windshear alerts, Tower reported many microburst warnings, so I believe we made the right move in retrospect.		A B737 flight crew reports diverting to COS due to delays into DEN and a low fuel situation. Windshear alerts are reported at COS and the aircraft generates a windshear warning during approach at 1,200 to 1,500 FT. The crew elects to continue after considering fuel and the likelihood of windshear becoming worse. A safe landing ensues.

We reset the affected systems and reran the checklists accordingly. We departed EWR Runway 22R at Whiskey. After takeoff, the First Officer (pilot flying) noticed we had no main electric control wheel stab trim. We then determined the speed trim was not working. The autopilot was engaged to see if it would trim the stabilizer, and we received a Stab Out Of Trim light. Next, we attempted to trim the stabilizer manually. The manual trim worked normally with no jamming of the system felt. I notified ATC we would need a slower speed and lower altitude to troubleshoot the problem. We leveled off at FL240 at 260 KTS. We continued on the departure routing while troubleshooting the problem.I checked all the applicable circuit breakers (none were popped) and began to run the QRH Checklist. I also notified Dispatch of the problem and that we would possibly need to divert. Next, the First Officer and I discussed cycling the circuit breaker. I cycled the Stabilizer Trim Circuit Breaker. This action successfully restored the main electric control wheel stabilizer trim and the autopilot trim. I notified the Dispatcher the systems were operating normally, and requested he consult with Maintenance to ensure they felt we could continue to our destination. I also brought to the Dispatcher's attention the possible reporting requirements for flight controls in the FOM. The Dispatcher consulted with Maintenance, the Chief Dispatcher, and per my request, the Chief Pilot on call, and all saw no reason we could not continue. They felt the FOM reporting requirements applied to primary flight control malfunctions, or directional control problems, neither of which applied in this situation. The First Officer and I agreed since we had manual trim, which negated any directional control problems, and the stabilizer trim is a secondary flight control system. I made the final decision to continue on to our destination after consulting with the First Officer. We landed uneventfully, and the system worked normally the entire flight. After consulting with Maintenance Control, I made an Info Only write-up in the logbook for the cycling of the Stabilizer Trim Circuit Breaker.		One thing of interest that did occur was the Ground Crew pulled the power without coordinating with us while the APU was spinning up. The trim had already been set for takeoff. We were without power for about 15 seconds. When we ran checklists again, the trim was set with no need for adjustment.		A B737-700 flight crew experienced an inoperative main electric stabilizer trim condition after takeoff following a power interruption of about 15 seconds at the gate when ground personnel removed Ground Power without prior arrangement. Pulling and resetting the stab trim circuit breaker returned the system to normal operation.

During the second speed reduction the aircraft dropped out of VNAV Path. Simultaneously we had a pack trip off line. The First Officer began the QRH checklist while I continued with the descent; hustling down to at least be close to the crossing altitude at DRUZZ it did not occur to me that there existed a level portion on the descent between DRUZZ and REVUE until it was too late and we descended below 15,000 MSL. Experience with new automation and accepting the lowest form of automation when a problem exists may be the key to preventing such events. Once the aircraft dropped out of VNAV Path I should have immediately selected the next stepdown altitude (15,000 FT) in the altitude window. Being relatively new on the aircraft I am anxious to master its many modes of descent. Choosing the simplest mode when under duress is usually the safest course of action.		However, prior to reaching REVUE we descended through the required 15,000 FT to approximately 14,300 FT.		When their FMC VNAV Path function was unable to comply with both the ELDEE STAR crossing restrictions and ATC speed restrictions the flight crew of a B737NG attempted to manually comply with the crossing at POOCH at 11,000 FT, but while doing so, descended through the required 15,000 FT between DRUZZ and REVUE. Distraction from a tripped pack during the descent was a contributing factor.

Before departure we were told to expect at least 15 miles in-trail spacing. Immediately after departure we were given a series of S turns east and west and restricted to 17,000 FT and 250 KTS for an extended period of time due to weather south. As we were handed off to Washington Center we were given a climb to FL280 and also told to expect moderate chop in the climb. The Captain elected to keep the flight attendants seated. I also began cooling the cabin down. Approaching approximately 80 to 90 miles north of VILLS Intersection we detected a line of weather and knew we would need to deviate. We also were also experiencing continuous light to moderate chop at this time. We elected to go east even though this was the downwind side of the weather due to another area of heavy weather west of VILLS. We were given a climb to FL300 and by this time within 80 miles and were beginning to experience light to moderate turbulence. We were told that it would be a minute before we could turn but the Captain told them we needed an immediate turn do to the turbulence as we started to experience serious disruptions in pitch and roll. We began the turn to the south-east and ATC gave a further climb to FL320. As we were turning we entered an area of moderate to severe turbulence. The autopilot disengaged as it would not hold heading or altitude. I was pilot flying and was totally focused on aircraft pitch, power and keeping the right side up. This period of turbulence lasted 10 to 15 minutes. We experienced serious updrafts and downdrafts and over shot our altitude by approximately 600 FT. We informed ATC that it was impossible to maintain altitude in these conditions and were given further climb to FL340. At no time did we come within 40 miles of the heaviest depiction of weather of the radar. As a note the winds out of the southwest were around 145 KTS. We eventually leveled at ATC assigned FL350 for a period as we did not want to much higher as the ability to hold airspeed was a factor. We also did not want to descend back down to more turbulent air. We were still experiencing moderate turbulence as we were paralleling the track from VILLS to SBY. As we got south of SBY the turbulence abated to continuous light-moderate chop. We then were able to continue out climb to our filed altitude of 380. I would like to commend the Captain on his decisive coordination with ATC to get us away from the weather and helping me by giving continuous inputs on engine performance and backup on airspeed and aircraft performance. Also by seating the flight attendants early and having them stow the carts saved some serious injury. We were somewhat concerned that after we had reported this severe turbulence that ATC was still willing to allow aircraft to deviate into that area of turbulence. As we had no ACARS, we immediately reported this to Dispatch as soon as possible. We also entered this event in the logbook. At no time did we feel that aircraft load limitations were exceeded or structural integrity was compromised. Overall through teamwork and preemptive action we were able to avoid any injuries although we did have some very frightened but appreciative passengers.				A B737-800 encountered severe turbulence at FL350 near SBY.

We were vectored for another Visual Approach to 19L. Configured, stabilized, and cleared to land, at 700 FT AGL, we were told to go around. In the process of cleaning up the aircraft and climbing to the assigned aircraft, we were asked if we had traffic in our ten o'clock position below us. I told my First Officer to relay negative. We were given a heading of 170. My First Officer asked the Tower to repeat the heading, and there was no response. At this time, we saw a low aircraft climbing westbound at our ten o'clock, quite close to us, and immediately turned another ten degrees left (160) to adequately stay clear of the traffic. We received no TCAS TAs or RAs. We were vectored for an uneventful landing to Runway 25R. New procedures for LAS go-arounds need modifying. I called the Las Vegas Tower and spoke to the Supervisor to find out what happened. He stated that recent changes handed down demanded that once an aircraft crossed a certain point on their screen, a go-around was immediately issued for the aircraft landing on Runways 19. My concern is this leads to fast moving, converging aircraft in a high workload phase of flight and, in our case, with a nose high attitude and limited visibility of any aircraft below. Some new procedure needs to be expedited to prevent any big problems this might cause in the future.		On second, ATC directed a go-around for 19L, first was for emergency aircraft, a potential loss of aircraft separation occurred. At about 700 to 800 FT AGL on final for 19L, LAS Tower directed a go-around. They then asked if we had the aircraft departing 25R in sight. The Captain did not see them and we replied negative. While performing the required call-outs on the go-around to clean up the aircraft, I heard 'heading 175'. I asked LAS Tower if the heading was for Company flight number. Silence on the radio for three to four seconds. I asked again if the heading was for Company flight number and to please confirm. No answer from Tower. At this point, we could just see the departing aircraft pop up in front of us at our nose for 3,000 FT to 4,000 FT. May have been farther due to the bright lights against the night sky. After the appropriate expletive, the Captain maneuvered the plane to the left to create separation. I then called the aircraft in sight. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The Tower Supervisor told the Captain in a phone call that new FAA rules, enacted one to two weeks prior, mandated the go-around for the intersecting runways and added to the conflict. The nose up position of our aircraft in the go-around did not allow us to see the departing aircraft until it passed at or near our altitude. LAS Tower needs to ensure adequate separation for the intersecting runways. If we continued to land, there would have been no problems. The directed go-around caused the loss of separation. The new procedures need to be refined so that a potential disaster does not occur.		Air Carrier on short final to LAS Runway 19L described a conflict event with departure traffic, the reporter alleging new mandatory go around procedures explained by ATC presented a safety concern as experienced in this instance.

A foreign Heavy was cleared for take off and crept onto the runway. We performed Tower approved S-turns to create spacing and landed safely on Runway 10 after the foreign Heavy finally lifted off. ORD ATC needs to increase spacing for departures, especially a foreign Heavy which takes more time to taxi, spool-up, and reach rotation speed for liftoff. Tower should not expect the landing aircraft to destabilize their approach to create the needed spacing.				Air Carrier landing ORD described the need to S-turn on final to allow time for a heavy departure, the reporter noting ATC should increase spacing of arrivals to allow for departures.

With approximately 2 hours remaining to our destination, we were faced with several options. We could continue as planned at altitude on an over water route and land with 5,000 LBS of fuel or go inland and arrive with approximately 4,000 LBS of fuel. Knowing that aircraft dispatched for single pack operations are limited to 25,000 FT, I felt both of these options unwise. While the QRH seems to allow us to continue in a single pack operation as high as 41,000 FT, I felt it safer to descend to the dispatchable limit for several reasons: We had just experienced complete in-flight failure of one of two critical components, cause unknown. Useful consciousness at that altitude is about 15 seconds. Potential pressurization related injuries to passengers would be much more severe at the higher altitudes. Why expose ourselves by putting all our faith in a single pack at high altitude and still arrive at our filed destination with minimal fuel. We need more clarification on the disparity between the QRH and the MEL. Common sense tells me the MEL limitation is there for a good reason. Regardless, we were unable to make it to our destination at the lower altitude with the fuel on board. With both a system failure and a fuel divert, I declared an emergency. We landed uneventfully, refueled, had the pack placarded, and departed 40 minutes later at 24,000 FT. Since dispatch with a single pack operation is common, most pilots are familiar with the limitations. A note in the QRH clarifying the capabilities of a single pack and/or the direction to continue at altitude would be helpful.		Closer review of the procedure shows we could legally have continued the flight, but again, it just didn't make sense. There should be a note clarifying the crew's ability to continue flight at cruise altitude even if it is above (in our case well above) the dispatchable FL250. I think the Captain chose the most prudent and safe route by declaring an emergency and diverting. Clarify the QRH Pack procedure. In step 3 of the procedure, at the end of the first option (Both Pack lights extinguish), 'Continue normal operation' is specified. That statement is NOT found at the end of the next option where a single Pack light remains illuminated. If flight at high cruise altitude is a recommended outcome at the end of step 3, then the procedure should state so.		A B737-800 at FL370, diverted to an enroute airport for fuel after a left pack failed because with a distant destination, over water flight or a revised overland routing at FL250 would have resulted in a minimum fuel situation.

The Captain moved the flap lever and I began to slow from 210 KTS. Almost immediately, the Captain noticed the flap gauge was not indicating any movement of the flaps. I maintained speed above the flap maneuvering speed and stopped the descent at the final approach fix altitude. At the time we were approaching the FAF. The Captain began running the QRH. I flew the airplane and took the radios. When we reached the FAF we elected to go around and were given runway heading and a climb to 7,500 FT. We asked for vectors in the airport area while we worked the problem. I continued to fly the airplane and handle the radios while the Captain talked to Dispatch and ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flaps Non-Normal. The checklist calls for using the alternate flap system to configure for a flaps 15 landing. We completed the checklist and review, computed the performance data and asked for a ten mile final for a straight in to the runway. We continued the approach and landed with no additional issues.I credit the Captain with recognizing the failure almost immediately; checking the Flap gauge every time the flap lever moves is critical. I think task division played an important role: As the pilot flying, there can be powerful urge to help work the problem and run the checklist. It does take some discipline to resist that temptation and not be distracted from flying the airplane. This can be especially critical in situations where terrain and non-normal flight control are added threats.				A B737-700 flight crew performed a go around when the flaps failed to extend as they approached the FAF. They performed the QRH procedure, obtained 15 degrees of flaps using the alternate system and landed without incident.

I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance and after a conference, decided to return to our departure airport for the following reasons: If we lost the other channel, the next step required that we land at the nearest suitable airport. Another concern was the potential loss of the left engine, which would leave us with only a degraded number 2 engine with the thrust change caution. On a single engine, we would very possibly require rapid thrust changes during certain phases of flight (approach, go-around). Continuing to our destination would have found us flying over higher, more mountainous terrain with fewer suitable alternate airports. I felt the safest option was to return to our departure airport with great VFR weather, and light winds.After an uneventful landing, a Maintenance Technician informed me that neither A or B FADEC channel was testing properly for engine 2, and both channels were testing normally for engine 1. He also informed me the FADEC had a history and had been worked on the previous evening. Our Flight Papers had no record of this maintenance in our Log History, despite the importance of the critical engine component. An additional concern is that our Flight Manual does not include the caution to Avoid Rapid Thrust Changes. In the event of an incomplete ECAM message it would be important for the flight crew to be aware of this operational precaution.				An A320 Captain elected to return to his departure airport following receipt of an ENG 2 FADEC Sensor Fault ECAM message the resolution for which included the caution to 'avoid rapid THR (thrust) changes.' He then enumerated his reasons for opting to return to his VFR departure airport.

Checked the breaker panel and found the circuit breaker for the crossfeed valve popped. [We] referred to the QRH. By turning off left tank pumps, the fuel slowly began to balance. After reviewing the weather at our destination (less than 1 SM with snow) we decided to return to the departure airport. After coordinating with ATC and company, we started a turn toward that airport. After the fuel balance got to closer tolerances we turned all main tank pumps back on. Fuel continued to burn from the right tank only. At that time I declared an emergency and requested vectors for landing an en route airport. Continued to the divert airport, notified company and landed without further incidence. We landed with 5.63 on the left tank and 4.80 on the right tank. Maintenance told us that the fuel valve on the fueling panel had been left open causing the fuel cross feed breaker to pop and fuel to be drawn unevenly.				A B737-700 Fueling Panel crossfeed valve was left open after fueling which removed control from the cockpit crossfeed valve so after a fuel imbalance developed an emergency was declared and the flight diverted.

There was no anomaly noted on the engine instruments. The same vibration came back a few more times and would go away in about five seconds with roughly five minutes elapsing between each occurrence. Before the last time the last vibration came back, I asked the First Officer to ask Center for lower because I didn't like that the vibration kept coming back even thought we tried speeds from .80 to .75 in .01 increments.Out of FL360 there was a much more noticeable vibration, which we actually felt through our seats. At this point, the left engine failed, the autopilot disengaged and various alarms illuminated on the engine instrument display screen. The Engine Failure and Driftdown checklists were accomplished after declaring an emergency with Center. A single engine overweight landing was accomplished at the nearest suitable airport.After an initial inspection by company Maintenance I was informed the left engine had seized to the point where you could not even turn the fan blades. A substantial amount of melted engine parts were also found in the tailpipe.

At that time, I was turning to line up with the runway. I leveled off and continued the approach to intercept the PAPI glide path, and landed the airplane. I do not have access to the FMC as I write this, but I do recall that there was a published glide path on this approach. I thought that this would allow the use of VNAV. I am not certain why the HUD commanded a greater than normal descent, but in the future this could be avoided by either engaging the ILS approach mode after SAMUL, or maintaining visual contact with the PAPI after SAMUL.

Somehow we missed it on the Before Takeoff Checklist. While running the Climb Checklist at 10,000 MSL, we noticed the plane was not pressurizing, and started a level-off. At approximately 11,000 MSL, we got the Cabin Altitude Warning Horn. We leveled off, put on oxygen masks, and informed ATC we needed to descend to 10,000 MSL and they approved. We leveled at 10,000 MSL and the horn stopped. We then ran the Abnormal Pressurization, Cabin Altitude Warning Horn Checklist, and realized both Engine Bleed switches were off. One at a time, per the checklist, we turned the Engine Bleed switches on and the plane pressurized. We checked with the flight attendants to make sure the oxygen masks in the back did not drop, and that no one in the back was having any issues. They informed us that everybody and everything in the back was fine. We coordinated with ATC and continued. We sent a message to Dispatch with a brief description and our intentions to continue. The rest of the flight was uneventful. We did run all the normal checklists but did not properly crosscheck with our responses. It was not a planned bleeds off takeoff. I don't know for sure when the engine bleeds were placed in the off position. Proper preflight and better attention to the crosscheck during checklist challenge and response would have prevented this from happening.		We determined that the Engine Bleed switches were in the off position when we took over the aircraft at the gate. This is not an abnormal situation; however, it is not typical. Our expectations then led us to not carefully and thoroughly verify [and set] the [correct] setting. We had several chances through flows and checklists to remedy the situation before we arrived at the runway. We didn't and our last chance was hurried by an immediate takeoff clearance...in the future I plan to adopt a touch (or at least point) technique when accomplishing checklist items to focus my attention on the actual setting and not just the verbal responses. I further plan to reevaluate my pacing to ensure my aircraft operation is not compromised by a false sense of a need to rush.']		A B737-700 flight crew failed to note both Engine Bleed switches were off despite running predeparture checklists which required them to be in the on position. The error was discovered and corrected when the cabin altitude warning horn sounded.

I got a visual on the aircraft at the same time we received a TA from the aircraft. Within seconds, we received an RA to CLIMB. We leveled our approach, maintained visual with the traffic as he passed under us by approximately 200 FT.[Issue was due to] reliance of ATC to allow a VFR pilot to be the only one responsible for separation in Class Bravo airspace. If both aircraft cannot maintain visual separation, in this case we did not initially see the other aircraft; perhaps a vector away from the potential conflict could have been issued, even though the weather was VMC.				B737 Captain reports a NMAC with VFR traffic during visual ILS approach. The traffic was pointed out and expected to maintain altitude 500 FT above the B737 but started descending causing a TCAS RA.

As the pilot flying, I slowed the aircraft to M0.76 in anticipation of turbulence. About 5 minutes later we encountered moderate mountain wave and associated airspeed fluctuations. The initial wave was +/- 100 FT and +/- 10 KTS in light to moderate turbulence. We encountered a subsequent wave that resulted in a loss of 300 FT in altitude and a gain of 15 KTS in airspeed. Autothrottles retarded the thrust levers to about 50% N2 to avoid an overspeed condition. As the airspeed decreased to the selected value of M.076, the autothrottles failed to advance to maintain the selected speed. As the pilot flying, I disconnected the autothrottles and manually advanced the thrust levers to attain the desired airspeed. Despite manual thrust advancement to about 97% N2, the engines remained spooled at 50% N2. I announced the loss of thrust control to the Captain. At this point, the airspeed was decaying at a fast rate and reached a minimum of 210 KTS indicated (just above the yellow band). With the thrust levers full forward and unresponsive to commanded position, I disengaged the autopilot and began a descent while asking the Captain to obtain ATC clearance to descend. At FL395 the Captain obtained an ATC clearance to descend to FL340. The engines remained at 50% N2 with the thrust levers commanding a lot more for roughly 15-20 seconds. We completed the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall Checklist, event though there were no engine exceedences. At about FL370, the engines began to spool up to the commanded thrust lever position and thrust control was recovered. After completing the checklist, we elected to reengage the autopilot and autothrottles. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The decision was made to continue to the filed destination. The remainder of the flight was uneventful. [We experienced] loss of thrust control on both engines for 15-20 seconds during mountain wave activity.				After a B737-700 encountered mountain wave activity at FL400, autothrust reduced power to prevent an overspeed, but the thrust did not recover even with thrust levers full forward until the aircraft descended through FL370.

We were on speed and thought on altitude when ATC queried us as we were descending out of 12,200 FT outside of PUNNT (which had a constraint of 12,000-9,000 FT). ATC informed us that the GEELA arrival had a NOTAM for PUNNT at 10,000 FT. We were given a heading of 040 to fly. No further problems were encountered. Upon debriefing with the First Officer, we verified that we did have all the papers and that the NOTAMs were reviewed. Factors that most likely contributed to this NOTAM being missed were the short turn time with an airplane change, an excessive number of NOTAMs for PHX which gave us several pages of them, the lack of order to the NOTAMs, and the fact that this NOTAM printed with two others separated by space on our papers. We did find it, but we had to search.		We were cleared to PHX on the GEELA FIVE RNAV ARRIVAL 7R, and received a clearance to descend via the arrival. We were doing a managed descent and set 5,000 FT in the ALT window. Approximately one mile from PUNNT descending through 12,200 FT at 250 KTS ATC asked our speed and altitude. ATC then informed us that the restriction for PUNNT was 230 KTS at 10,000 FT. ATC vectored us off the arrival and gave us a 040 heading to intercept the Runway 08 localizer. Subsequent communications with ATC revealed that a NOTAM had been issued for the GEELA FIVE ARRIVAL changing the crossing restriction. The flight continued to landing without incident. The Captain and I did the preflight planning for the PHX flight while airborne on the previous leg as we were running about 25 minutes late and knew we would have less than thirty minutes to change planes and depart for Phoenix. The flight papers printed contained an 'INCOMPLETE MESSAGE' and large blocks of largely unformatted text. Prior to descent into PHX the Captain and I checked to make sure we had the current Commercial Chart page and we each checked the crossing restrictions in the FMGC to make sure they matched the charted restrictions. The sheer number of NOTAMs combined with the difficulty in reading them as printed by the aircraft ACARS printer contributed to us missing the change to our arrival procedure.		A320 flight crew reports missing a NOTAM changing the crossing restriction at PUNNT on the GEELA 5 RNAV to PHX. ATC advises and issues a vector. The NOTAM in question was buried in a very large list.

The Captain went back to the cabin to investigate. When he returned, he said didn't smell anything and that he and the Flight Attendant agreed it was OK to go. On climb out below 10,000 FT, there was a faint musty odor which dissipated quickly as we climbed past 10,000 FT. The cruise portion of the flight was uneventful with no further complaints of the smell from the flight attendants. I used the lavatory several times during cruise and noticed no unusual smells at that time. On descent passing about 8,000 FT, we noticed the musty odor and it was stronger than we had on climb out. After landing the Captain entered the descent in the maintenance logbook. Two of the flight attendants later complained of dry throats in the van on the way to the hotel.		Upon initial push back from gate I immediately smelled a 'dirty sock' odor. I called the Captain and explained what I was smelling. He came out of the flight deck, walked to divider and back and said 'I don't smell a thing. What do you want to do?' I explained that I wanted him to be aware that I smelled something, that at that moment I wasn't feeling anything strange but I could definitely smell something that smelled like dirty sock smell. I could smell it until we reached higher altitude at which time it was intermittent during flight. At approximately 8,000 FT on descent the odor became very strong. Passengers were expressing concern. There was a Company Mechanic on board in First Class traveling with his wife. He said it smelled to him like burning oil. He also indicated that he had smelled it on taxi out from our departure airport. His wife was vomiting during flight; she indicated that she thought it was from her diabetes. We landed and the odor continued. As soon as we reached the gate and doors were disarmed I called the Captain to inform him.	The Reporter stated that she also filed a report the day following this event on the same aircraft because of fumes and that aircraft was subsequently removed from service for an APU replacement.	A B737-800 Flight Attendant reported a dirty socks odor after engine start and the odor even stronger during descent for landing. The First Officer smelled it faintly during climb and stronger during descent. The APU was replaced.

A B737-NG encountered a high altitude windshear in the southeastern Cascade Mountain Range which caused the loss of 45 KTS at FL370.

Since we were heavy, about 160,000 LBS. on a short runway, we needed TOGA power and I kept the flaps out a little longer to ensure we could meet the altitude restrictions in the SID. After a couple more minutes we received an ECAM message HYD Pump Low Pressure Green. I told the First Officer to take care of the ECAM; I had the aircraft and radios and put on autopilot 1. The First Officer turned off the Green Pump and it appeared that the PTU was taking care of Green Pressure. After a bit of discussion, we sent Dispatch a message to call us. Dispatcher called and talked with the First Officer. We went into a holding pattern at FL190. At this point we started getting some occasional ECAM's and it appeared as though the PTU was not keeping the Green System above 2,700 PSI. The Yellow System was also indicating an overheat. We determined that the PTU was cavitating because the Green quantity was gone. This was confirmed when a PTU low pressure ECAM illuminated and we turned off the PTU. The Yellow System overheat went away and the hydraulic system seemed stable. The First Officer had been trying to talk with Maintenance but never could get a clear frequency, and ended up just dropping the phone patch. Dispatch agreed that we should return. We declared an emergency called Flight Attendants, made PAs, and the First Officer started on the ECAM. We felt like we were not in a hurry at this point and it would help to go slow and burn off some gas. We worked our way down to 10,000 FT in the holding pattern while the First Officer ran through the ECAM. We told Company and ATC we would need to stop straight ahead as we had no nose wheel steering. We completed the ECAM. We made one PA to the passengers, reviewed all the failed systems and told Approach we were ready. Our weight was 154,000. The First Officer cranked the gear down [Landing Gear Gravity Extension] with the checklist and we slowed to 210 about 10 miles out. We started putting flaps out early and were fully configured prior to the marker. All checklists were completed and we landed with a sink rate of 300-400 FPM. Landing was uneventful. We stopped the aircraft just short of Runway 09 and Tower told us to make a right. We reminded them that we had no nose wheel steering and could not turn the aircraft. We started the APU and shutdown the engines. A tug did come out to tow us to the Terminal, but the tug driver thought the gear doors might scrap and we asked a mechanic to come out and check. After a while the mechanic made it out to the aircraft and felt it was OK to tow in and we went slowly to the gate. There were no human factors. Dispatch, the First Officer, and all the ATC members were helpful and supportive.				A320 Captain experiences an ECAM message HYD Pump Low Pressure Green. The pump is turned off and initially the PTU appears to be maintaining Green system pressure. While holding at FL190 a PTU low pressure ECAM is annunciated along with a Yellow system overheat. The PTU is turned of and the crew elects to return to the departure airport after the Yellow system cools.

We were following another carrier for the ILS 26L. SCT changed our runway to 26R, slowed us to 170, and cleared us for the approach. Tower asked if we had the carrier in sight about 2,000 FT AGL. We informed Tower we were IMC. Tower instructed us to go around (about 1,500 FT AGL) with a climbing left turn heading 180 and direct PDZ when able. We were handed off to SCT and they asked about the assigned 180 heading. We told them our clearance, but they seemed irritated at us. Two separate Controllers asked about the clearance and commented, with over 30 years and 22 years working SCT, that they have never seen anything like that. We were told the 180 heading put us head to head with Chico's localizer. We never received any TA's or noticed any traffic on TCAS close to us. We were cleared for an uneventful ILS to Runway 26R. After landing, a Supervisor apologized to us over the Tower frequency for the go-around. I called Tower once we arrived at the gate to advise them of SCT's concerns. The Tower Supervisor again apologized to us and explained the training that is going on there. I recommended on a go-around event, they should level us off and allow us to fly the published miss. This would have kept us clear of the other airport.		[Narative #2 had no additional information.]		Air Carrier on final for ONT was issued go around instructions by the Tower only to be questioned by SCT Controllers regarding the assigned heading.

The #1 engine instruments all displayed engine failure.  We declared an emergency, asked for a descent and vectors back to the departure airport, and made an uneventful visual approach.  The 59 minute flight felt like 10 minutes and we made every effort to cover all the bases.  The event went smoothly after careful and gentle communications with the Passengers and Flight Attendants.  The Flight Attendant did a marvelous job, and as Captain, I am running the event over and over, certainly there are details we could have done better.  All in all, it was gratifying to see our training kick in and support the decisions and actions that had to be made.		We heard a loud bang and immediately noticed that the number one engine readings were abnormal.  Most notably, the EGT gauge was showing an over temperature and a red indication.  We made one attempt to restart the engine using a Crossbleed start descending through 17,000 feet.  This was unsuccessful.  We completed the Engine Failure, One Engine Inoperative Approach and Landing checklists and landed.		A B737-700's number one engine failed in flight at 32,000 FT, an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

We saw the other carrier as I was calling for flap changes and gear inside of ARCHI around 15 NM between 6,000 FT and 2,000 FT. I did not verify the flaps were moving on the indicator until 2,000 FT cleared to land by SFO Tower. I noticed they were indicating up with a slight split while the handle was at flaps 30. I executed a go-around, we ran the checklist for no flap less than 1, and used alternate leading edge extension which worked as advertised. Captain landed on 28R uneventful at gross weight of 113; at 167 Ref; autobrakes 2 used until <80 KTS. All paperwork filed with company.Flaps did not program from up position when handle was moved from up detent. Slight split showing on flap indicator between zero and flap position 1. I should have verified each flap setting as I called for it. Maintain aircraft control first. I will do diligence in the future. Although we were distracted by ATC and a flight that was being vectored in close proximity for a visual to 28L, that is no excuse.		Approaching SFO from the northeast, we encountered strong tailwind components below 10,000 FT after cleared for a charted visual approach to Runway 28R. I was the pilot not flying and selected flaps 5 at the First Officer's request when ATC advised us of traffic joining the 28L final from the southeast at approximately ten o'clock and 5 NM. At this point, both pilots became distracted and failed to monitor proper flap operation, as the First Officer called for landing gear and additional flaps to counter the tailwind and avoid overtaking traffic observed while making s-turns. Unaware flaps had failed to extend and the flap indicator showed a split on the needles just off the UP position, we inadvertently operated below normal clean maneuvering speed. However, I do not believe the First Officer ever slowed below the amber minimum maneuvering arc, nor did we get a stick shaker or an aural Airspeed or Flap Warning. We had been cleared to land and were descending on the Localizer inside the bridge when the First Officer detected the flap malfunction and immediately initiated a go-around. We accomplished the Flaps, Trailing Edge: Asymmetrical Checklist and were advised by Dispatch to land at SFO when able. After confirming adequate stopping margin and brake energy, we extended the LE flaps using the alternate method and lowered the landing gear to burn off additional fuel. I advised the flight attendants and passengers, and then accomplished a Captain flown approach and landing on Runway 28R using flaps less than 1, LEDs full extend, and target speed of 167 KTS. Landing was uneventful and no special cooling procedures were necessary, but as a precaution, I requested visual inspection of our brakes and tires from the fire rescue unit before proceeding to the gate. Upon arrival, I conferred with Dispatch/Maintenance and made an entry in the aircraft logbook.The pilot not flying is the first line of defense in recognizing system abnormalities and monitoring the [flying pilot's] performance during high workloads. I failed in this capacity by diverting my attention outside the aircraft while selecting flaps. I should have kept my hand on the flap handle, as I normally do, as a reminder to complete that task as I responded to ATC and looked for traffic. We should also monitor PFD airspeed tape for proper programming of flap maneuvering speeds and limit arcs during flap movement.		B737-700 flight crew reports being distracted by traffic approaching a parallel runway and not noticing that the flaps are jammed although the flap handle had been selected to 30 degrees. A go-around was initiated and QRH procedures complied with, resulting in a zero flap and full leading edge device landing.

Captain is flying pilot. On the takeoff roll, after making the 80 KTS call and looking back to the engine instruments I noticed the oil quantity was at 7 QTS, I called the abnormal oil level out to the Captain. Immediately after bringing this to the Captain's attention the oil quantity was now showing 2.5 QTS and pulsing. I said to the Captain 'oil is now at 2.5 QTS.' The Captain then chose to reject the takeoff at approximately 125 KTS, V1 was 135 KTS. The aircraft came to a full stop, on the center line of Runway 36. I made the call to the Tower and notified them of the reject while the aircraft was coming to a stop. After the aircraft came to a full stop, the Captain made his PA announcement to the cabin. We assessed the situation, turned on the brake fans and taxied clear of the runway and into the ramp. While waiting for our gate and communicating with maintenance and the company the oil level was now showing normal. We returned to the gate and wrote the malfunction up in the FDML. The brake temps rose to approximately 760 degrees C and then cooled with the brake fans on. Maintenance then informed us that this aircraft had a history of this oil quantity indicator problem and the flight was canceled. After seeing the oil quantity drop rapidly to 2.5 QTS and pulsing, we believed that we had lost the oil from the number 1 engine and that an engine failure was imminent. We were below V1, so the decision was made to reject the take off. A thorough knowledge and understanding of the reasons to reject a take off above 80 KTS would have led to a different decision about rejecting at a high speed. The previous statement is a reference to myself.				An A320-200 Captain rejected a takeoff at 125 KTS after the oil quantity decreased to 2.5 QTS during the takeoff roll and after arrival at the gate the crew was told the aircraft history indicated a quantity indicating problem so the flight was canceled.

I was the flying pilot and assumed control of the aircraft and radios and assigned the First Officer to consult the QRH for immediate action and exception items there were none. I then asked for 'ECAM ACTIONS'. The procedure was followed which called for the isolation and shutting down of the Green Hydraulic System. After completion of the initial ECAM procedure it was clear that it led to many more ECAM items and follow up items that must be accomplished. It was truly a very busy day in the cockpit. At this point I notified ATC of our situation and declared an emergency and to standby for more information of our plan on diversion or return. I also turned to our FAA Line Inspector, who was on our jump seat observing and told him that he was no longer evaluating us but was now a crew member and any and all input from him was appreciated. The flight attendants were notified using T.E.S.T. as a communication guide and the passengers were also notified from the cockpit. The three of us returned to the business of managing all the follow up items associated with the Green Hydraulic System now inoperative. We communicated with Maintenance Control and Dispatch our situation. We advised them that we were holding at FL330 present position and working through the procedures. We elected to return to departure airport. We planned on holding at a lower altitude with flaps 2 to burn down below max landing weight. Dispatch did give us the go ahead to land overweight but we thought having only one reverser, no autobrakes, slow flaps, only some spoilers, no nose wheel steering, manually lowering the landing gear, and an FAA guy helping us in the jump seat, that having lots of time, we elected to burn to less than 142 KTS for landing. At this point we received a call from the flight attendants that there was a passenger disturbance in back. An individual claiming to be a reporter would not follow crew member instruction during a declared emergency. This man was attempting to film and interview crew and passengers as the event unfolded and ignored all requests from crew and fellow passengers to sit down and behave. We finally assigned two armed police officers who were traveling with us to baby sit him while the adults handled the in flight emergency. After holding for more than an hour, our weight was below 142 KTS and we made an approach and landing. The landing gear was lowered manually with no event; we had briefed all the items that would pop up when we did this and planned for the extra time. The landing was uneventful and we stopped at the far end of the runway remaining on the runway until we were pulled to the gate. There was much rejoicing and lots of police to meet our, non compliant, passenger.				A320 crew experienced a GREEN HYD SYS RES LOW passing FL330 and elects to return to departure airport after declaring an emergency and burning down to landing weight.

After inspection of the overhead stowage compartment located directly above those seats, it was soon established that the water had leaked out of a passenger's Camel Pack stowed in it. The leak eventually stopped. A few minutes later, the 'A' Flight Attendant reported to the Flight Deck that the Flight Attendant Call Light and all Passenger Reading Lights located in row 12 above seats A, B, & C had switched ON and could not be switched OFF. The Captain advised Maintenance Control and Dispatch of the situation. VHF communication was challenging along this route segment and had to be re-established multiple times. What became apparent was that we were dealing with an 'ill-defined' problem. The Captain and First Officer discussed the situation and became increasingly concerned with continuing the flight with an unknown electrical situation in a PSU filled with water due to the possibility of electrical shorts and fire. The Captain exercised his Emergency Authority and diverted the flight with the concurrence of Dispatch and Maintenance Control. An uneventful approach was made. Maintenance Technicians inspected the PSU's in row 12 ABC, found it filled with water and applied appropriate procedures to dry it out and de-activate it. The flight was later re-dispatched under MEL 35-2D 'Row 12 ABC PSU's INOP'. Our three Flight Attendants handled this situation with great professionalism by providing detailed and accurate information to the Flight Deck. It was especially impressive that they observed that all 3 PSU's weren't functioning properly and promptly communicated these important facts to us on the Flight Deck.				B737 First Officer is informed during climb that water is leaking from the bins above seats 12 A, B, and C from a passenger's camelbak. Later it is reported that all reading lights above those seats have switched on and cannot be switched off. The crew elects to divert for maintenance.

We responded no problem as we were in a -700 with only 17 passengers and about 7.5 on the fuel. Out of FL260, I mentioned to the Captain that we were out of FL260. I didn't make any pitch/airspeed adjustments to expedite our climb. I think we were still in VNAV and LNAV. As I was changing approach books and looking down to the right, at FL383, I heard 'Airspeed Low,' and looked at the CDU and saw the message 'Buffet Alert!' I looked at the airspeed and noted it was below 200 KIAS. I looked at the N1s and noted they were at full climb thrust. Either I disconnected the autopilot, or it disconnected. I noticed a very slow descent and then noticed the target Mach displayed at .82. This initially confused me and I mentioned we must be in a severe mountain wave. The Captain said he had spun the speed knob to .82 when he heard the Airspeed Low announcement. I still wasn't sure we weren't in mountain wave, but left the power up and slowly decreased the descent to level flight, and then after considerable time, began to continue the climb to FL400. I think we lost about 300 FT during this episode before we were finally able to continue our climb. I don't recall ever seeing Level Change or anything other than VNAV throughout the climb. Fortunately, we were light and able to reverse the flight path with little altitude loss. I asked to have the FDR downloaded to learn why this incident happened.We could have done a better job monitoring the airspeed in the climb. The Captain was getting ATIS and gate information, and I was filling out upgrade paperwork and changing books during the climb. This is not a real short leg, but getting ahead of the game on shorter legs is crucial. As pilot flying, I need to ensure the airplane is performing as expected before turning my attention to other tasks. The other crew member must always inform the pilot flying when making any inputs to the FMC.		The first thing I looked at was airspeed and noticed it was below 160 KTS. Then, I looked up and saw the airspeed window open so I spun the airspeed to about .82 while the pilot flying disengaged the autopilot and increased the airspeed. I have no idea how the airspeed bled off the way it did with the automation hooked up.		Distracted by ancillary duties while expediting their climb at ATC's request the flight crew of a B737-700 was alerted by an 'airspeed low' warning as they were in the vicinity of FL380.

In placing his hand on the levers the Captain managed to advance the levers to TO/GA. I was not aware of this. Rotation was normal; I began the immediate left turn using the flight director to follow the PORTE departure off runway 19R. At the annunciation for power reduction I moved the levers aft one click and advanced them one click thinking I had selected MCT. In actuality I had selected TO/GA. The flight directors then indicated a steep climb and a turn back to runway heading which would have taken us into terrain. While in IMC trying to understand the indications, we hit a 30+ knot increase shear. The speed tape blurred and jumped to 250. I called for flap retraction and managed speed. Because we were in TOGA managed speed could not be selected. I called for speed intervene 250. I maintained a left turn to continue the PORTE departure ignoring the command bars right turn. Within seconds the sheer was over and the speed tape jumped back to 220 KTS. There was never a sheer warning. Tower gave us a heading and directions to proceed to a fix further along the departure. Tower then asked what departure we were flying. The Captain stated the PORTE and that we encountered turbulence and sheer and therefore had trouble navigating. Tower stated 'No problem'. Obviously I was not precisely on track because the aircraft was in the go around mode and indicating direction to fly a programmed climb and track.				A320 First Officer reports inadvertent selection of TOGA thrust during a planned flex thrust takeoff and the problems encountered at thrust reduction/clean up altitude. Thrust levers are retarded one detent to get into the auto flight climb mode then advanced one detent to maintain MCT (actually TOGA), putting auto flight into go around mode. A flap overspeed occurs due to windshear and the high thrust setting.

As I noticed the airspeed low and was disengaging the autopilot and auto throttles, the Airspeed Low Aural Warning sounded briefly as I was advancing power and lowering the nose of the aircraft. Airspeed recovered quickly and the flight was completed without further event. All ATC clearances were adhered to. Aircraft did not stall. Airspeed quickly recovered after lowering the nose of the aircraft. In retrospect, I have seen the VNAV disengage numerous times on Company aircraft. Monitoring the FMA closer would have prevented this from occurring.				A B737-700 Captain reported a near-stall incident in climb when the aircraft dropped out of VNAV into Vertical Speed mode. Reporter stated this is not an uncommon occurrence.

We checked in to Fort Worth Center and were direct to LBL. We first noticed that the ACARS had stopped functioning. No ATSU menu information was available, printer function stopped etc. What little troubleshooting we could do didn't help. We waited a little while to see if it would begin working again and after about ten minutes selected the appropriate Commercial Radio frequency on the number 2 radio to monitor (131.65). Another carrier was using the frequency to deal with a lengthy medical emergency. Unknown to us at this time ATC had failed to pass us off to the next sector frequency. Several distractions from the cabin occurred; a bathroom break, etc. We passed into the next Commercial Radio sector and switched to 131.30 which was quiet. Up to this point radio chatter on ATC was always present, and we had no real reason to suspect we had missed any radio calls. Approaching LBL it was apparent something was amiss and several calls to Fort Worth by us weren't answered. Another aircraft relayed a frequency to us and we contacted Kansas City on the correct frequency over LBL. Within a minute Dispatch was heard on Commercial Radio calling us. They requested we Confirm OPS Normal gave us the appropriate sector frequency and asked about ACARS messages that weren't answered. We told them the ACARS was inoperative and that we had reestablished ATC communications. The ACARS was reported inoperative to Maintenance upon landing. I called Dispatch and Fort Worth ATC after landing. They informed me we had flown through multiple sectors 'NORDO' over a period of about 25-28 minutes. Fort Worth said they had failed to properly hand us off but wanted to know why we couldn't be reached by company, etc. Other than listening better to subtle indications on the radio that we had flown past the hand off, the time elapsed and realizing over DFW sectors would be changing quickly I don't see much else we could have done differently. Dispatch tried to send us ACARS messages, but none got through. I didn't see an immediate need to call Dispatch via Commercial Radio to tell them our ACARS was inoperative, especially when the frequency was being used for an emergency. Sector frequency changes can occur in a little as a minute or more than 20 minutes. Sector lines and frequencies are not indicated on HI Charts as is the case on Latin American charts. Perhaps a sector change indicator could be incorporated into the NAV data base somehow. We have become very reliant on ACARS, yet will quickly try to dispatch aircraft with it inoperative. The requirement to monitor Commercial Radio with an inoperative ACARS is unknown to some and I could only find one small reference to it in the FOM. Monitoring guard is recommended, not required by the FOM.				A320 Captain reports an ACARS failure en route at FL360. At about the same time the aircraft flies out of the current ZFW sector without a frequency change. Over twenty minutes pass before the crew detects the lost comm situation and contacts Center.

The Captain (pilot not flying) performed the ECAM actions and applicable OEB from the QRH and cleared the caution. Immediately after, another ECAM master caution appeared for a HYD YELLOW SYS RSV OVERHEAT. The Captain again performed the ECAM actions as directed by the flying pilot and cleared the caution. The aircraft status resulting from both ECAMS showed several items inoperative for the flight, including some spoilers, yaw damper, nose wheel steering, and engine bleed 1. Considering the inoperative systems, flight duration remaining, and possible further degradation of the aircraft systems, the Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to discuss a possible air return. After discussing the aircraft status via air cell, the Captain, with cockpit crew agreement, made the decision to return and land overweight with concurrence from Dispatch and Maintenance. The flight crew notified ATC of their intentions to return and declared an emergency as a precaution due to our degraded status. The in-flight crew was briefed and the passengers were informed of our return. Flight was cleared to a holding point and began preparing for an overweight landing (157,000 LBS) on with a tow off by ground personnel. The First Officer (pilot flying) continued flying the aircraft and talking to ATC while the Captain reviewed landing performance data with the inoperative spoilers and overweight procedures in the QRH. With mutual agreement on sufficient landing distance by the First Officer and Dispatch, flight began approach preparations for a Captain flown ILS. The prevailing winds were from the south at 190/23 gust 33 with approaches being conducted to crossing runways. All applicable checklists were performed and the aircraft was cleared for approach and landed without incident. The aircraft came to a stop on the Runway and was met by a company tug crew and emergency equipment. The aircraft was towed clear of the runway and into the gate. Upon securing the aircraft, logbook entries were made for the engine bleed, HYD RSV overheat, and overweight landing. The aircraft was deplaned and passengers/crew reassigned to a standby aircraft.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information]		Immediately after takeoff an A320 ECAM alerted ENG 1 BLEED AIR FAULT, then YELLOW SYS RSV OVERHEAT so an emergency was declared and the aircraft returned to the departure airport.

We completed the Takeoff Checklist and as we rounded to corner toward the runway, it began to look like the aircraft was on final for our runway. The First Officer vocalized his prospective that the aircraft on final appeared to be for our runway. Just after we crossed the hold short line, the First Officer said, 'Stop!' I stopped the aircraft immediately. About the same time, the aircraft on final asked the Tower if he was still cleared to land on [Runway] XXL or if the Tower wanted him to go around. The Tower said, 'Oh s**t, go around!' The aircraft went around and we waited for another takeoff clearance. Nothing further was said by the Tower (probably trying to recover from the error.) We were subsequently cleared for takeoff, took the runway and departed normally. ATC error clearing an aircraft for takeoff [with an aircraft] landing on the same runway.				ATC cleared a B737-800 for takeoff, but that flight crew thought an aircraft on approach was lined up on their runway. As they delayed ATC commanded the other aircraft to go around as that aircraft's crew questioned their landing clearance.

At some point, the Captain who was also flying pilot selected Airspeed Intervention of 270 to slow for the turbulence and expedite our climb. At approximately FL340, I noticed a 'buffet alert' message in the scratch pad of my FMC. As I noticed the airspeed at the top of the yellow arc, the Captain disconnected the autopilot, lowered the nose, and advanced the throttles. At the same time we encountered more turbulence and the airspeed continued to decrease to the point where we got a momentary stick shaker. The airspeed then accelerated rapidly and we resumed our climb to FL360. We estimate that the recovery process resulted in a loss of 200-300 FT. Should not have used Airspeed Intervention, should have used 280/.76 in the climb page and VNAV.				A B737-800 Captain selected MCP SPD during climb in moderate turbulence and later a FMC 'BUFFETT ALERT' was noticed, followed by airspeed in the yellow arc. The autopilot was disconnect and a stall recovery completed with a 200-300 FT altitude loss.

While accomplishing Job Card XXX-004, the proper Thrust Reverser (T/R) lockout pins [with streamers] were not installed due to the fact that there are none in ZZZ. I, [Mechanic Y], was tasked with closing the T/Rs, closing the pylon panels and closing cowlings. Due to the fact that improper pins were installed, there were no streamers [attached to the pins]. The removal of the [Reverser] pins was inadvertently missed and there was no Operational Check of the T/R after Job Card completion. The A320 aircraft left and landed at its next destination where the Thrust Reversers did not deploy on landing.I did not see lockout pins and closed cowlings. Event was identified in the arrival station. I have no information on what happened at that station.

For the most part, our route was south of the weather. We were flying at FL380 rides were deteriorating at all altitudes. En route, we were deviating south of some weather after it was determined we would not be on top of it. Later on, ATC gave us new routing, putting us closer to the weather. As we got closer to our destination, there was some more weather in the area. We evaluated deviation versus topping the weather. We both agreed we would easily top it and be in the clear; shortly thereafter, the Pitch Limit Indicator (PLI) and the airspeed decreasing. Then, we encountered a severe downdraft followed by the aircraft banking aggressively left to right. The stick shaker, bank angle, then later, the overspeed warnings came on. I lowered the nose as well as tried to return the aircraft to a wings level condition. I glanced at the radar to try to find somewhere smoother to go, but there was nothing anywhere on the radar. For awhile later, there was still moderate turbulence. We declared an emergency, and the Captain called the flight attendants several times to check on them and the passengers. We proceeded to our destination. The approach, landing, and taxi in were uneventful. At the gate, we tried to help check on the flight attendants and passengers.		Downdraft caused a descent from FL380 to FL310 and we also experienced left and right rolling of the aircraft. Made a PA to tell all onboard to insure seat belts were fastened. We recovered at FL310 climbed to FL320 declared and emergency with Center. I was in contact with the flight attendants who were keeping me informed of the situation in the cabin. Paramedics met the aircraft at the gate to take care of any injured. I made a logbook entry in the aircraft maintenance log regarding the severe turbulence encounter.		A B737-800 encountered severe turbulence at FL380 where, in a downdraft, it descended to FL310 after which an emergency was declared and upon arrival at the destination paramedics met the aircraft to attend the injured.

We responded to the affirmative and were subsequently cleared to 40,000 FT with the restriction of 2 1/2 minutes.  When it became apparent to the Controller that we could not meet the restriction he vectored us off course.  The lesson here is simply this: If you cannot easily make the restriction do not accept it.  It is too risky.  I should not have accepted the clearance.  The difference between 36,000 FT and 40,000 FT in terms of fuel use is insignificant and posed a risk that was too great for the benefit derived.  In the future, I will decline clearance to a higher altitude from a high altitude unless it is painfully obvious that we can make it.  I think the Company should give additional high altitude performance training to Crews and suggest that perhaps the risk is high compared to the reward when tasked with high altitude changes in altitude when there is a time limit involved that is close to performance limits as it was with our situation.		[Narrative 2 contained no new information]		A B737-700 Crew accepted a climb from FL360 to FL400 to be level in 2 1/2 minutes but when ATC discovered that restriction would not be met vectored the aircraft off route.

I was the Captain and pilot flying, cruising at FL370 overhead a Southwestern City at the time of the turbulence encounter. My First Officer (pilot not flying) was busy running the radar and communicating with Center in an effort to avoid the widespread buildups along our route. With the passengers and flight attendants seated, we were deviating around the last ridge of buildups (in and out of IMC) when we observed a towering cumulus directly in our path that didn't appear on radar. As we entered the cloud, we encountered moderate turbulence resulting in an instantaneous MMO exceedence of several seconds. I immediately disengaged both the autopilot and autothrottles, and retarded thrust levers to idle. As we came out of clacker, I advanced the thrust levers steadily as the engines slowly re-spooled, and it appeared for a few moments that our airspeed was stabilizing. However, a few seconds later we experienced a rapid airspeed decrease accompanied by stick shaker, and I responded by advancing the thrust levers to emergency thrust and lowering the nose to keep the airspeed within the yellow maneuvering margin. By this time, we had descended to 36,700 FT, at which point my First Officer advised ATC of our turbulence encounter and altitude deviation. The entire event was of short duration from onset to recovery. Dispatch was notified via ACARS of the MMO exceedence and RVSM airspace deviation. Follow-up with the flight attendants revealed no injuries to passengers or crew. Upon landing and not receiving an ACARS exceedence message, I made an Info Only write-up appropriate for this level of MMO exceedence and notified both Dispatch and Maintenance Control. We over-relied on the radar in this case and underestimated the severity of turbulence associated with cloud tops that were not producing radar returns.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information]		A B737-700 encountered moderate turbulence in a cloud top which resulted in an MMO exceedence followed by rapid airspeed decrease and a 300 FT altitude loss in order to maintain airspeed.

Approach assigned a turn off the arrival, vectoring for the ILS at 4,000 FT in IFR conditions. With turn to heading, I saw that my display now said map not available. I checked and saw that Captain's display also said map not available. Neither FMGC displayed navigation information. Then ECAM alarmed Cabin Landing Elev not set - use manual pressurization. We asked for vectors off approach to try to investigate situation. ACARS to Dispatch for closest VFR weather; Captain asked ATC for weather at nearby airports and declared Emergency Aircraft. Manually tuned ILS available on Captain's radio and set inbound course. [We] received good ident and DME asked for vectors to ILS. Manually depressurized aircraft to landing elevation; used selected speeds for approach and landing.		A320 flight crew reports dual FMGC failure during approach in IMC. The ILS frequency is successfully tuned using the RMP and the flight lands at destination after manually depressurizing the aircraft.

At 10,000 FT as I started to accelerate to climb speed, I noticed the aircraft was not trimming in the nose down direction and wanted to pitch up. I told the Captain I thought we might have a trim problem, and passed control of the aircraft to him to try. He found the same results, returned control of the aircraft to me, and got out the QRH. I took ATC on the radio, while the Captain ran the QRH checklist and contacted Maintenance Control. In the course of evaluating the malfunction with maintenance, and after discussing the Circuit Breaker reset policy, we elected that as a flight control system malfunction, it was within the Captain's authority and would be prudent to attempt one reset of a popped Circuit Breaker. The popped Circuit Breaker was reset and immediately popped again when nose down trim was selected. At this point, we completed the QRH, and began a diversion. An uneventful, heavyweight, flaps 15 (per QRH) landing was accomplished. Stabilizer Trim system failed sometime after the trim was set for takeoff. (Note: aircraft was trimmed nose down to set takeoff trim during normal checklist operations and functioned correctly at that time).		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information]		A B737-800 Stabilizer Trim failed after takeoff without a failure annunciation when the circuit break popped, was reset and popped again, so the flight diverted to a nearby airport.

Note: During climb to get out of poor weather conditions, excessive engine vibration was noted on #2 engine and the Engine Vibration Checklist had to be accomplished; suspected ice on the fan blades. Approximately 12 minutes of flight was conducted in the clear at FL340. Once passed heavy precipitation conditions, a descent back down to FL240 was made. Remainder of flight was uneventful and accomplished below FL250 per MEL 35-4-02.		We were cruising at FL240 due to an MEL restriction that restricted us to FL250 due to two POBs used on the previous flight for a medical emergency. We encountered a wide line of weather and experienced moderate rime icing. We elected to climb to FL330 since ATC advised this altitude was above the weather. We stayed at FL330 above the weather until clear of the line and then descended back to FL240 as soon as possible.

This is when we noticed we were climbing at 230 KTS. I noticed flaps were still at one. We corrected the flap position and continued flight. Flap 1 airspeed was never exceeded. I'm not sure whether I called for flaps up or not, but I obviously didn't crosscheck the flap position indicator. So crosschecking and confirming the requested action is needed. We also started to get multiple ACARS messages regarding mountain wave avoidance areas around FTI and CIM. This distraction led to me not keeping an eye on the airspeed. Aviate, navigate, and communicate come to mind.		I (First Officer) became distracted immediately after takeoff and do not remember hearing the 'flaps up' call. I did not put the flaps up. I became distracted by receiving multiple ACARS messages concerning MOD-SEVERE Turbulence plots along our route of flight between PHX and CIM. ATC asked us about our airspeed and we noticed that we were slow on climbout passing FL230 at 230 KIAS and realized that the flaps were still down in position one. We placed the flaps up and continued to accelerate to our normal climbout schedule. Prioritize what is really important in 'critical phases of flight.' During my employment with another Legacy carrier, we had a Climbout Checklist passing 3,000 MSL which was: 1. Flaps, 2. Landing Gear Handle - Off, 3. Autobrakes - Off. Adding that to the FOM and Checklist cards may be worth considering, since we are about to meld different procedures.		A B737 crew failed to recognize the flaps had not been retracted climbing through FL230 because of distraction from numerous ACARS messages regarding enroute mountain waves.

There was a large storm system over South Florida, the Keys, and the eastern portions of the Gulf of Mexico. Miami Center requested we climb to FL410 for a smoother ride, we agreed as we were right in the tops and the CRZ page in the FMC indicated a max altitude of FL410. We accepted a climb to FL410. Now with Havana Center, we had a build up along our route just to the north that we estimated topped FL430-FL450. Westerly winds exceeding 100 KTS at altitude. We requested a southwesterly heading from Havana Center to keep a safe distance from this cell. Approximately 20-30 miles east of this cell (and directly downwind) we experienced very abrupt moderate chop. Immediately the speed trend vector decreased very rapidly into the min safe range/lower fishhook. As the stick shaker activated the Captain stated 'I have controls'. The airplane banked right approximately 30 degrees and back to the left approximately 20-30 degrees. I observed altitude deviation of up to +300 and -200 FT. As the now pilot not flying, I requested immediate descent to FL400 from Havana Center. Descent clearance was approved. We descended to FL400 with no further incident. The event occurred because we did not maintain an adequate buffet margin at altitude with the present weather conditions. When the Captain took control he added thrust and hand flew the airplane attempting to maintain assigned alt and heading. When operating in the weather conditions that we were, a greater margin of safely operable speed range is required. I.e. [we should have been at] a lower altitude. We also had the option to go the long way around the storm cell to the north which would have been on the upwind side yet required a deviation of a great distance. This option would have been prudent.		We accepted a climb to FL410 anticipating being above all of the buildups and a smooth ride. We were direct to UCL talking to Havana Control. There was a TCU 30 NM +\- 43,000 FT on our route. We requested deviation to the left (east) of the TCU with a heading of 210 degrees. Havana Control approved the deviation and stated, 'Direct to UCL when able'. The winds aloft were 270/110; remaining 20-25 NM from the TCU. As we approached abeam, downwind of the TCU, we encountered turbulence which activated the stick shaker, them aircraft rolled to the right 30-35 degrees then to the left 25-30 degrees. I took the controls. To be honest, I do not recall if the autopilot had disengaged on its own or not. I did however, disengage the auto-throttles and began the stall recovery maneuver. Adding thrust climbing 41,300 FT. The onset of the stall recovery maneuver, the First Officer requested a lower altitude of FL400. This was immediately received from Havana Control, stating 'maintain FL400, direct to NOSAT when able'. At that time I had the aircraft stable at 40,800 FT descending to the new assigned FL400. We maintained FL400 and proceeded direct to NOSAT. Flight continued with no further incident. The flight crew of 7 sustained no injuries. However one flight attendant reported hitting her chin on an armrest. Upon landing, I went back to check on her. She said, 'I'm fine'. The First Officer and I discussed how this incident could have been avoided. We concluded a lower altitude is the obvious solution, providing more of a buffet margin.		B737-800 flight crew at FL410 reported encountering turbulence downwind of a thunderstorm causing the aircraft to roll sharply right and left and activating the stick shaker. The Captain assumed control, adding thrust, and the First Officer requested descent to FL400.

Tried to make adjustments to temp and air flow without results. Talked to tech without resolution to the problem. My concerns were that: 1) there was no airflow to cockpit instruments, 2) comfort level to crew and ability to carry on with duties in a sealed and hot environment, 3) the uncertainty of the situation over the Atlantic with distant alternates. It was decided the prudent thing was to return to to departure airport for further evaluation. It was also decided to open the bottom panel of cockpit entry door to allow some airflow into cockpit and circulate through instrument panel. This helped tremendously. Note: there were 4 on duty FAMs on our flight, so we felt secured in opening the panel. Declared an emergency for overweight landing. Normal approach and smooth touchdown. Switched passengers to a different aircraft and re-dispatched with the same crew. After landing Maintenance looked at the problem and found out that part of the conditioned air plenum was frozen solid at a location which could not be corrected in flight, thereby cutting off all air circulation into the cockpit.Ground crews and Maintenance should be made aware that the use of full cold air conditioning while the aircraft is on the ground and under their care can cause frozen vents, valves and air conditioning systems, particularly when humidity is high. Flight crews may not be aware of the impending problem until airborne, as happened in our case. Use of air conditioning systems while on the ground should be done properly and in compliance with their limitations.		We pulled up the AIR synoptic and there was nothing abnormal, however; the cockpit and the rear zone of the airplane were 85 degrees, although the commanded temperature was 75 degrees. The rear of the plane slowly started cooling off, but the cockpit was actually getting hotter. According to the Maintenance Technician who met the aircraft, it is common for the hangar Maintenance folks to crank the packs to full cold when working on the aircraft. In humidity, this can cause the pack duct to freeze up and apparently this is what happened to us. The left pack was completely frozen up and we were getting no air from the pack.		A B777-200 flight crew returned to their departure airport when they were unable to control airflow and temperature in the cockpit.  Maintenance determined the cause to have been frozen air conditioning components due to excessive cooling demands on the ground in high heat and humidity.

Fuel quantity indication for #1 gauge read 7.11 fuel indication on #2 gauge read 5.9. The #2 quantity was dropping rapidly and the #1 gauge was showing no fuel burn at all. The appropriate checklists were completed and determine that there was no fuel leak; however, when the imbalance was addressed it was found that the crossfeed valve was inoperative due to no blue light indications. It was subsequently determined that the crossfeed circuit breaker had popped. Since access to the fuel in #1 tank was in question, it was felt to be the safest course of action to divert the aircraft. An amended release was acquired from Dispatch, an emergency was declared and the aircraft was cleared and steered direct. An uneventful descent, approach, and landing was made with an imbalance in fuel tanks of approximately 1,600 LBS on touch down.		After a through preflight in which I checked all circuit breakers, we departed. About 10-15 after level off at FL390 I noticed the fuel imbalance annunciator. The left tank was 7.11 and the right was 6.89 and dropping rapidly. We accomplished three checklists. Starting with fuel imbalance QRH than proceeded to the fuel leak QRH. We determined we did not have a leak as the fuel on board was the same as what we computed should be remaining. We were burning fuel out of the right tank only. At that point we discovered that the crossfeed lights were what appeared to be burned out. We changed those and the light still did not test. It was at that point that we both saw that the crossfeed breaker had popped. We than did the crossfeed inoperative QRH; not knowing the fuel status of the left tank, this left us several options. At this point we could not determine what the position of the valve was and was probably open allowing the right boost pumps were most likely operating at a higher pressure to over power the left side. When we departed the switch was in the closed position. On descent and at a lower altitude with the engines at idle and fuel burning out of the right tank only, we 'opened' the crossfeed valve and began cross feeding normally. Approaching the final approach fix, the Captain repositioned the crossfeed and boost pumps to the normal positions and we made an uneventful landing.		B737 flight crew receives a fuel imbalance indication at FL390 and discovers that fuel is being used from the right tank only. The crossfeed valve is found to be inoperative with the circuit breaker tripped and the crew elects to divert to a suitable airport.

We were on a visual approach and heard Tower clear another aircraft for takeoff on Runway 01R. I pointed this out to the Captain and we both began to monitor his progress as we were on short final. We agreed it looked pretty tight but would probably work out. Tower then cleared another aircraft to takeoff on Runway 01L. We were now on a very short final and knew the spacing would not work, but before we could relay our concern to Tower he canceled the takeoff clearance for the aircraft on Runway 01L. We were still monitoring the aircraft on Runway 01R and approaching 500 FT we realized the spacing was going to be too close. This is when Tower directed a go-around. We began the go-around and Tower directed us to fly a 280 heading. The Captain, while hand flying, spun in the 280 heading and pressed heading select. He then followed the flight director as we began to clean up. A few seconds later Tower relayed the heading again and that is when I realized we were on a 310 heading following the published missed approach. I pointed this out to the Captain and he was a little confused. We quickly returned to the correct heading. We were only on the incorrect heading momentarily and did not appear to be a conflict with any traffic. We were vectored around again for an uneventful landing on Runway 28L. We discussed the heading error later and noted that on the B737 the aircraft will not come out of the approach mode unless the FD's are turned off and then back on or another ILS frequency is selected, etc. Pressing the heading hold button is not effective here.ATC Tower should not schedule takeoffs and landings on crossing runways with spacing that tight. A heavy aircraft on a hot day may accelerate considerably slower [than planned]. Also, ATC should realize that during a go-around the pilots have a high workload and can become task saturated when they are giving multiple clearances while the aircraft is still trying to clean up and accelerate.

We were in a gentle descent to 2,800 FT (IAF altitude at OKC 17R) when OKC Tower came on frequency and said it looked like we were lined up on Wiley Post, and to climb to 3,000 FT and gave us an appropriate heading. We complied with the instructions and picked up OKC 17R and landed without incident. There were no TCAS RAs/TAs, the aircraft was always in a stable configuration, and there were no additional instructions from the Tower.		Upon reaching 2,800 FT the pilot not flying commented that the ILS DME for Runway 17R still showed 12 NM, but that the runway seemed very close. We then both commented that the ILS glide slope showed low while the VASI showed high.Our company procedure of backing up all approaches with available navaids helped the crew realize something was not right during the approach, but it was the Tower that clarified our visual error.		Cleared for a visual approach to OKC, the flight crew of an A320 mistook PWA for OKC and began a descent to land there. Approach Control noted their track and altitude and brought the error to their attention.

Additionally, the First Officer's PFD had 'SPD LIM' flag and the low speed indicator was missing. We referred to the QRH and notified Maintenance Control and Dispatch via ACARS. After approximately 30 minutes we started losing additional equipment. We lost the First Officer's weather radar, both ECC's went into ALT mode, Captain's low speed limit, and the First Officer's pitch F/D. Based on what information we had lost I surmised we had lost the #2 Display Electronic Unit (DEU) and possibly some information from #1 DEU. I was monitoring the weather in our filed destination and at that time it was [900 FT] BKN, RA and 10 miles visibility. I referred to the Approach/Landing data for non-ILS approaches and noted we are required to have the Source in AUTO. I interpreted this to mean we need both DEU's. Also, in my judgment it would not be prudent to make an instrument approach with only one DEU operating. If we were to lose the second DEU we lose all 6 displays and would only have the standby for flight instruments and no engine or hydraulic indications. I then made the decision to declare an emergency and divert. We were about 100NM from our divert airport and it was VFR. We landed uneventfully and once on the ground maintenance ran a bite test and it indicated the #2 DEU had failed. Additionally, something did not test properly with the DEU interface. The mechanic pulled both DEU's out and swapped them and reinstalled and tested again. This time both DEU's passed. Maintenance released the aircraft with the remark of no previous history. I flew this aircraft 2 more legs and everything worked normally.				A B737-800 First Officer's Display Electronic Unit (DEU) failed in flight so the crew diverted to a VMC airport where Maintenance determined that both DEU's had faults.

On climb out [we were] issued FL410, we checked weight and optimal altitude temperature was +17 and we were heavy for FL410, requested FL390 instead. It took a couple of calls to understand ATC's acknowledgement. Somewhere in this process the Flight Attendant called for [warmer] temperature in cabin. Captain answered and told me to adjust temperature. This interruption distracted [us] from entering FL390 in MCP and FMS. Aircraft climbed to 39,800 before we caught it, then center reminded us we were given 39,000 and [to] descend.		I was the pilot not flying as we were climbing through FL250 when Merida Center assigned us FL410 for our final altitude. The pilot flying requested me to ask Merida Center for FL390 as a final altitude since we were too heavy for FL410. I requested and was immediately re-cleared to FL390. I called 'climb and maintain 390' to the pilot flying. He repeated the call out to climb to FL390 and started to wind the altitude control knob up. At this instant the Flight Attendant 'dinged' us on the cabin call channel and I went 'heads down' to answer the call on the audio control panel before verifying that the pilot flying actually rolled 39,000 in the altitude control window. After answering the Flight Attendant's call and request to warm up the cabin, my attention went to the air conditioning panel. Now, after returning my attention back to the status of our climb, all seemed normal. I did not notice that the pilot flying had set 40,000 in the altitude window instead of 39,000 that Merida Center had reassigned. When we passed through FL390 the pilot flying made the call '390 for 400' and I repeated the call. After 20-30 seconds Merida Center asked what altitude we were at and I called out FL400 as we were approximately 39,900. Center then announced to us that we had been assigned FL390 and instructed us to return to FL390. We immediately returned to FL390 in a normal descent. There were no other aircraft visible on TCAS (80 NM range) during this entire time period that I recall. The rest of the flight was uneventful (other than the discussion of how exactly the altitude excursion occurred). [We needed] strict compliance with SOP that requires absolute verification of vertical and lateral assignments. While we both verified our altitude assignment by calling it back to Center and each other, we both allowed ourselves to be distracted at a critical moment. The lack of confirmation in the FMA and MCP window caused the pilot failure. I never returned my focus back to the MCP altitude window after I allowed myself to be distracted. I also assumed that the pilot flying was actually selecting 39,000 in the window as I went 'heads down'. The pilot flying allowed himself to be distracted to the point that he selected the wrong altitude in the MCP window. One simply HAS to verify the assignment is actually completed in the FMA and the MCP. DO NOT allow yourself to be distracted!		A B737 crew requested FL390 as the final altitude but became distracted and failed to set the MCP or FMC which resulted in climb to FL399.

The seat belt sign was on but two flight attendants were in the very back of the aircraft working in the aisle with the cart. It looked as though we would clear the tops of the buildups but at the last minute we just went through the tops. There was one moderate bump of turbulence. I called back to the flight attendants and they informed me that they had both hit the ceiling and the cart had turned over. I asked if they were hurt and they said yes. Further discovery revealed they both required medical help. I turned the flying duties over to my First Officer and asked him to declare an emergency and we diverted to a nearby foreign airport. I got a phone patch through Commercial Radio with Dispatch and told them we were diverting with a Medical Emergency with two flight attendants injured and requested medical help upon arrival. We landed uneventfully. My First Officer and the number 1 and 3 Flight Attendants performed their duties perfectly. The station personnel did a superb job of making arrangements for our passengers. In retrospect I should have given more clearance to this build up even though we appeared to be well above it and on the back side of it. I was trained that you should use the HUD to determine your Flight Path Vector above or around build ups. This training has worked perfectly until now. It clearly did not work in this case. I will never use the HUD guidance for avoiding build ups again.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information.]		A B737 passed in the top of a thunderstorm where moderate turbulence injured two flight attendants and turned over the beverage cart so an emergency was declared and the flight diverted to a nearby foreign airport for medical attention.

[We] came out of hold direct to ORD and given visual 28. I briefed the highlights for 28 (flap setting, turn off, target speed, etc.). ILS Runway 27L remained in the box and none of the other three pilots caught the oversight. We then received a descending series of left turn vectors from Approach Control who eventually asked if we had the runway in sight? Turning into the sun with visibility reduced by haze, I could not see the airport but the First officer reported the runway in sight. I armed the localizer and assumed we would intercept the final course. Four things happened in very rapid succession. 1. Runway 28 came into view with suitable forward visibility. 2. I stated, 'Why didn't the localizer capture?' 3. The Tower Controller asked us to check our runway. 4. We received a TCAS RA with an aircraft on final to 27L. I immediately turned off autopilot, continued left turn and with minor adjustments, rolled out on 28 final. After landing I spoke to ATC who advised 'no harm no foul' and thanked me for the call.I had not received my usual amount of rest prior to this flight, nor was I able to get any sleep during my rest break during the flight. I thought I was fine, but in hindsight I was fatigued, due to lack of sleep. In my opinion, fatigue was the main cause of this event. My normal SOP adherence did not occur due to a lack of mental sharpness.		...approach asked if [we had the] runway in sight. Crew said yes. We were cleared visual approach. Captain waited for localizer capture to help verify runway.		Distracted by unanticipated holding and suffering from duty time related fatigue the flight crew of a very long range B777 failed to reset their FMS/ILS for their reassigned runway and flew through its extended centerline at ORD. An alert from ATC and a TCAS RA with respect to an aircraft on final to an adjacent parallel runway prevented more serious repercussions.

After reviewing the QRH, we looked further into the DDPG [Dispatch Deviations Procedures Guide] and discovered that the message was a result of MEL 21-40-01. We looked further into the MEL's and discovered that we were not in compliance due to conflicting MEL's. The MEL's that were on the aircraft and certified as airworthy by Maintenance Control were: 1. MAIN DECK FWD SOV 1 - M21-40-01 2. MAIN DECK FWD SOV 3 - M21-40-013. MAIN DECK AFT SOV 3 - M21-40-011 above has an (O) procedure. #2 & #3 do not have an (O) procedure. Initially, reading only the (O) portion of the MEL's within the DDPG, we were required to position the M/D FLOW switch to HIGH under MEL 21-40-01. The other MEL did not contain an (O) which is an Operational procedure for the flight crew to deal with. When reading all notes it was discovered that there was a conflict with the two MEL's that were placed into the logbook. In order to have FWD SOV 1 MEL'd the AFT SOV 1 and 2 must operate normally. Additionally, the FWD and AFT SOV 3 must operate normally. In order to have the FWD SOV 3 MEL'd, the FWD SOV 1 AND 2 must operate normally. Additionally, the AFT SOV 1 and 2 must operate normally. In order to have the AFT SOV 3 MEL'd, the FWD SOV 1 and 2 must operate normally. Additionally the AFT SOV 1 and 2 must operate normally. As you can see, there is direct conflict within the MEL's and it is not possible to have these respective MEL's active at the same time. The event officially occurred when we blocked out due to NOT being in compliance upon block out. After it was discovered that there was a potential issue with the MEL status of the aircraft, Maintenance Control was consulted. After Maintenance Control agreed that we were out of compliance, we contacted the Chief Pilot to advise him as to the situation. I would like to suggest that a full briefing be at minimum, accomplished by the Maintenance personnel on site to the operating captain/crew prior to every departure. This could possibly assist in all parties being in full understanding of the MEL's and potential conflict between any specific series of MEL's. Furthermore, a more comprehensive check/investigation by Maintenance Control should be conducted before issuing any control numbers for MEL's. It is understood that as Captain, the final responsibility falls upon his/her shoulders as to the airworthiness of the aircraft, however to what extent? Do I need to have them pull every panel and show that each individual item is deactivated, tie wrapped, secured closed or open, etc., per the MEL? I would hope that once maintenance personnel places MEL's in the logbook, places stickers on the logbook cover, and places stickers on the affected items in the aircraft, then signs off the logbook, that this would mean that the items in the logbook had been checked for compliance, maintenance actions performed, and proper entries made.		As an (O) Operations Procedure, we complied with the statement in the appropriate MEL stating to operate the M/D FLOW switch to HIGH. We as a crew complied with the MEL (O) OPERATIONS function of the respective MELs. The event occurred due to Maintenance improperly certifying an aircraft being airworthy when the respective MEL's were in direct conflict.		B777 flight crew discovers airborne that they have departed with conflicting MEL's concerning Main Deck shut off valves. After consulting with Maintenance the flight continues to destination.

During the descent and at 280 KTS I noticed my airspeed decreasing. I assumed the autothrottles were not working properly and switched off autothrottles. When speed continued Towers minimum selectable I selected autopilot off and pushed the nose over. The First Officer was busy as this was our third or fourth route change and two runway changes and he was busy. Then he noticed on the descent checklist that we had degraded to CAT 3 single and was investigating that anomaly. In the meantime I was struggling to control the aircraft because my airspeed was wrong and I was getting close to overspeeding the aircraft by pushing the nose over and advancing the throttles. The First Officer called airspeed. He was referring to the impending overspeed on his side - I thought he was referring to the impending stall that I was sensing on my side. In the heat of this struggle we crossed the intersection at 11,700 vice 10,000 assigned and told ATC that we could not make it as we had a problem. After we discovered whose instruments were correct via reference to the standby instruments I switched to Captain on Air Data 3 and switched to Autopilot 2 and autothrottles back on. It was very confusing and now we were behind. I was not confident that the speeds were correct and the First Officer was very busy, but doing a great job as pilot not flying. He was reading the EMERGENCY QRC MACH AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE, setting up the FMGC for the new runway and communication with ATC. After confirming the aircraft was under control we proceeded hurriedly, but uneventfully to touchdown on 27L.	The reporter stated that this event lasted about 60 seconds and what ran through his mind was the A330 accident. The short period of this event was very confusing because there were no other indications of an airspeed malfunction nor any clue as to what the crew should do other than begin the AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE procedure. He was so shaken by this event that he removed himself from the remainder of the trip.	We were given a descent to cross the intersection at 10,000. As we started our descent I began the approach/descent checklist as the Captain was the pilot flying. Shortly thereafter we received a runway change from 27R to 27L. I entered the new runway into the FMGC and continued the checklist. Upon reaching the 'Status check' part of the checklist I noticed that CAT three single was displayed on the ECAM status page. Neither I nor the Captain knew why. I had just entered the new runway and I was trying to figure out if there were any correlations to the new approach. While I was trying to figure out why the Captain disengaged the autopilot and soon after disconnected the autothrottles, we were passing through 13,000 FT. The Captain then advanced thrust and then went to climb thrust and engaged the autothrust stating the autothrust was not working. I didn't understand the statement because it was commanding idle thrust and we were in open descent mode. Again the autothrust began reducing trust toward idle. We were at around 280 KTS and 11,000 FT when the Captain disconnected autothrust and went to climb thrust. As the airspeed climbed I asked the Captain to watch the speed and he said 'I know.' We climbed to 11,300 FT and airspeed was still increasing. I told the Captain that we were going to overspeed. That is the time we figured out that his airspeed indicator was incorrect with cross checking all three indicators. Captain switched to Captain on AIRDATA 3; the airspeed overspeed by about 5 KTS. The throttles were brought to idle and speed brakes deployed. By this time we were too high to make the intersection crossing and we notified ATC. We were given a descent to 9,000 FT and we were given a heading. We were later slowed and given a heading to intercept 27L. With all the confusion we passed slightly through the LOC intercept and we were given a heading of 310 to join. Total 1 1/2 dot south of centerline; we then centered LOC and the remainder of approach was normal.		An A320 Captain's airspeed decreased toward V1s during descent, so he disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles to manually increase airspeed when the First Officer discovered the aircraft was overspeeding. They determined the Captain's airspeed was in error and the air data computer was at fault.

We were in weather IMC and rain showers, so the First Officer, immediately performed the escape maneuver, and the warning ceased immediately. We requested a right turn to avoid thunderstorm buildup to the north and climbed initially to 12,000 FT then recleared to 14,000. We were vectored in sequence for another approach with no warning on the second approach. The minimum vectoring altitude where we were, based on raw data was 6,000 FT.

I was the pilot flying and initiated a mandatory 'escape maneuver climb' due to the IMC conditions. I climbed the aircraft and we eventually leveled off at 14,000 FT with ATC clearance. We returned to holding due to weather/aircraft traffic in the area and then completed an uneventful approach/landing into Runway 07 at MROC.

We were on vectors for the visual for 26R. TRACON called out traffic for 26L, another carrier's heavy; we advised in sight and would maintain visual. TRACON then stated, 'Roger, follow the other carrier...he's for the left, you are cleared the visual 26R'. As we proceeded inbound, at about the time we pulled abeam the other carrier, ATC blasted us and said, 'Company, what are you doing? I told you to follow the other carrier!' The Captain responded with, 'We understood he was for the left, we are for the right...how do we 'follow' to separate runways'' TRACON did not like our query...we were never told that the other carrier 'should not be passed, etc.' At that time, we received a Climb RA. We responded to RA for a short climb, followed by an uneventful landing on 26R. The other carrier also received an RA and chose to go-around. 'Company is cleared the visual 26R, the other carrier is for the left do not pass or overtake.' This is a phrase we have all heard, and complied with. The Controller upon initial check-in was clearly agitated with all four aircraft he was handling. He was very 'testy' in ALL his transmissions.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information.]		Air Carrier was instructed to 'follow' traffic that was landing on a parallel runway confusing the flight crew, the reporter noting the clearance was unclear and a 'do not pass' instructions should have been issued if required by ATC.

At the 80 KTS call, I checked my airspeed indicator and it was normal and indicating approximately 80 KTS. Then a few seconds later at an airspeed somewhere between 80 KTS and V1, I glanced back down at my airspeed indicator and it was showing below 80 KTS. As Captain, I exercised my command decision to reject the takeoff. The rejected takeoff maneuver was completed, and we taxied clear of Runway 19R. My First Officer informed Tower, consulted the QRH and turned on the brake fans. I made a PA announcement to the passengers and stated the reason for the rejected takeoff. I also informed them that we would be returning to the gate after our brakes had a chance to cool. We then informed Operations and Maintenance and returned to the gate. After consulting with Maintenance, we deplaned the passengers without incidence. I then called Dispatch and informed the Dispatcher of the event. Systems Scheduling then decided to cancel the flight. The event occurred due to a faulty and inaccurate airspeed indication.		At approximately, V1 the Captain called 'reject' and said something about his speed and rejected the takeoff. I advised the Tower we were aborting the takeoff. The Captain let the autobrakes decelerate the aircraft until a safe speed and finished the braking manually. The Tower asked if we needed any assistance, we declined and they told us to contact Ground clearing the runway. We cleared on Taxiway W1. At this time I advised we needed to go back to the Gate but needed to stop and let the brakes cool. We pulled off on the taxiway to let the brakes cool and I advised Operations we needed to return and have Maintenance meet us. I got out the QRH and reviewed the hot brake section with Captain. After about 10 minutes with the brakes cooling down we proceeded to the Gate and met with maintenance. On the taxiway while we waited for the brakes to cool the Captain said his airspeed indicator was only showing 80 KTS when he glanced down at it. Up to the time of the reject my airspeed indicator was showing normal acceleration. I believe the Captain rejected the takeoff due to the fact he didn't think there was sufficient airspeed to continue.		An A320 Captain rejected the takeoff near V1 because his PFD airspeed indicated around 80 KTS while the First Officer's indicated near V1.

During the arrival we had basically flown radar vectors in lieu of the arrival to navigate around thunderstorms and isolated cells in the area. Weather and visibility was clear from base leg to final and on the arrival corridor. At approximately 1,400 FT MSL, I verified airspeed and called for flaps 30. As the First Officer began to move the flap handle from 25 to 30, we experienced a sudden increase of airspeed which quickly/eventually ended up to be an increase of 30 KTS. Upon noting this, the First Officer moved the flap lever back to the 25 position and then up to the 15 degree position. I continued flying the aircraft on the glideslope with adjustments to pitch and power. After the airspeed decreased from a high of 180-185 KTS, we attempted to extend the flaps back to 25. Although the handle moved, the flap indicator remained at 15. There were no signs of a split or skew. The First Officer moved the Ground Proximity Flap Inhibit Switch to Inhibit as per the QRH and we increased the bug speed. I continued flying the approach at flaps 15 to a normal landing. After clearing all runways, we raised the flaps and they retracted normally.		We were on final approach to land in MIA, ILS 09 approach in VMC. At approximately 1,400 FT MSL, The Captain called for flaps 30 degrees. After verifying the speed was below 175, I moved the handle from 25 to 30 degrees. Looking up I noticed the airspeed trend vector rapidly moving to an increasing speed trend and knowing that a possible airspeed exceedence was about to happen, I moved flap handle back to 25 degrees and then 15 degrees. The Captain continued to fly the aircraft on the glide slope with adjustments to pitch and power. After the airspeed decreased from a high of 180-185 KTS, we attempted to extend the flaps back to 25 degrees. Although the handle moved, the flap indicator remained at 15. There were no indications of a split or skew. The 'Too Low Flaps' audible warning sounded and I moved the Ground Proximity Flap Inhibit Switch to 'Inhibit' as per the QRH and we reset the bug speed to the flaps 15 speed. The Captain continued to fly the approach at flaps 15 to a normal landing. Upon clearing the runway I reported to the Tower an airspeed increase of approximately 30 KTS at about 1,300 MSL. After clearing all runways, we raised the flaps and they retracted normally to 0 degrees. We notified maintenance via radio.		B737-800 flight crew experiences stuck flaps during approach when the flap lever is first selected from 25 to 30 then quickly retracted to 25 then 15 as a wind gust threatens to overspeed the flaps when the flaps cannot be extended, bug speeds are adjusted and a flaps 15 landing ensues. Flaps retract normally after landing.

We were supposed to fly from city to city to city. When we arrived in city we were pulled from our aircraft and it was given to a crew that was almost five hours late. They were to fly our leg to city since they were almost timed out and we were to fly their pairing of city, city, city, city greatly extending our day. We were told the aircraft was at another gate and we were to leave in a half hour.When we arrived at the new gate, the aircraft was there but two Mechanics had the First Officer's sliding window out and were working on it in the front seat. Obviously the airplane was not going to leave in a half hour, it was not boarded, and we had not been informed by anyone that it was being worked on. The Mechanics worked on the window for quite a while and finally pulled the aircraft from service. We were told we would get the next aircraft to terminate. This took a long time and we did not leave city until two hours later.We flew to city which was controlled on the way in and uncontrolled on the way out due to the late hour. We unloaded and loaded the aircraft and flew to city. Both of these flights occurred without incident. We loaded up in city and departed early in the morning. On climbout the Center Controller seemed slow to respond and we had to ask for a turn on course to the north. We proceeded up to city which was now uncontrolled as well. Center descended us down to 2,000 FT, but because we were never given a frequency change, at some point we went lost comm. We were now at 2,000 FT on a downwind flying inland with no communication with Tower, Approach or Center.I tried to raise Center several times and was about to squawk 7600 and turn in for the approach when the First Officer noticed another frequency listed on the approach plate for Center. We dialed it up got hold of the same Center Controller and turned in for the approach.Although ATIS was reporting 800 FT overcast we broke out right at minimums; almost a go-around situation. We landed and blocked in an hour later.This situation is not that abnormal ten days later. I was woken up in my hotel room by scheduling after getting to the hotel late in city, moved up, and given 30 minutes to van time to then take an airplane from city to city. Once in city the aircraft was taken and we had to wait almost three hours for an aircraft to be ferried from city. We then proceeded with our 12 hour plus day after a short overnight.It may be a difficult situation, but at some point, a flight may just need to be cancelled or fresh reserves called in. Fatigue is not limited just to Company. We had controllers that were slow to respond. ATIS information that was inaccurate or slow to be updated, maintenance information that was not getting passed along and, because of Dispatch and Scheduling decisions, two flight crews with long days and very late hours instead of one. All of this happened to us in the continental United States. My concern is that this will only be compounded in such places as Mexico with poor English speaking controllers, no terrain clearance, and poor radar coverage.				A B737-700 Captain provided a detailed description of the debilitating effects of flight pairing reassignments and delays encountered on flight crew's ability to perform effectively. Also provided examples of ATC disfunctionalitly he believes may be exacaerbated by similar fatigue inducing scheduling practices.

Rotation initiated at 142 KIAS, ground speed approximately 165 KTS. No adverse conditions were noticed with gear retraction and clean up. While at cruise, Minneapolis Center informed us the Tower reported we were one of four possible aircraft that may have lost some rubber on the runway on takeoff. I called the 'A' Flight Attendant, and asked her if she or anyone else had heard or felt anything unusual during the takeoff, and she stated she had not and no one else had noticed anything unusual. I then talked with the 'B' Flight Attendant, and he stated he thought 'we might have run over something on takeoff'. I then contacted Dispatch and informed him what Center had told us and that I suspected we could have some tire damage. I suggested we could divert and deal with it there as we have Maintenance on the field and it would still be daylight with good weather conditions. Dispatch then contacted Maintenance Control who preferred us to continue to our destination. Five minutes later, Dispatch contacted us and stated they had decided jointly that diverting was a better choice. We agreed and began our diversion to the other airport. We declared an emergency with ATC and requested holding at 10,000 FT to burn off enough fuel to land below our MGLW [Maximum Gross Landing Weight]. We held for about 20 minutes while the flight attendants prepared the cabin for an emergency landing. We then flew a low approach over the runway so the Tower and fire trucks could help us determine if, indeed, we did have damage to our tires and to what extent. The Tower stated the last fire truck detected some damage to our right inside main gear tire. We then flew a left downwind approach and landing with noticeable degradation of the landing gear. We stopped the aircraft on the runway with no directional control issues other than the obvious destruction of the right inside main tire. The Fire Department indicated through the use of their FLIR equipment that the right inside main tire was extremely hot and falling apart. When we were sure of the safety of the aircraft, we shut the engines down and requested a tug to tow us to the gate. After the tug was hooked up, they attempted to move the aircraft but were unable to do so without further damage. Maintenance determined the tires needed to be changed on the runway before the aircraft could be moved. Station Ops had the Passengers deplane and take buses to the terminal and board another airplane. Maintenance changed the tires and we were then tugged into a remote gate. We preflighted the other aircraft and, with the same flight attendants, boarded the passengers and departed.Some final thoughts, even though we reviewed the emergency evacuation QRH items, my timing on letting the Flight Attendants know when we were one minute from landing came too early, and as a result they ended up calling out their commands longer than normal. After ensuring the aircraft was safe I called for flaps up when I should have left them in the 40 position due to possible damage from the tires.		The Captain and I checked the weather and noticed rain in the forecast for our time of arrival which was taken into consideration and made the Center plan seem a bit more desirable. That and the fact that having daylight on our side would have of course made any outside visual confirmation much easier.I actually think that this event went very smoothly and was handled well by all parties involved. The presence of tire pressure sensors of course would have given us some valuable information regarding what to expect on the landing. This seems like a potentially common enough event that maybe some specific QRH guidance could be developed for such an event.		A B737-700 diverted to land after it became likely they had suffered tire damage on their takeoff. Upon landing it was clear the likelihood was confirmed.

The First Officer moved the flap handle from 25 to 30 but the indicator stayed at 25. All other flap indications were normal. We quickly confirmed the flaps 30 position on the flap handle and tried 15 and 40 positions to fix/confirm the problem. We had a Company pilot in the jump seat and handed him the QRH and he started the 'FLAPS, TRAILING EDGE: SYMMETRICAL NON-NORMAL/NO FLAPS' Checklist. We were discussing a go-around when we got the warning, 'TOO LOW FLAPS' and executed a normal go-around. Tower was informed of the go-around but we did not declare an emergency nor did we receive traffic priority as we did a box pattern back to the landing runway. During the subsequent pattern and QRH review we realized we had moved the flap handle out of the 25 position when the QRH states, 'Flap Position ... Do Not Change'. We returned the flap handle to the 25 position, completed the QRH actions, and landed without further problems. We made a logbook entry, contacted Maintenance, they corrected the flap issue, and the aircraft was returned to service.Things happen pretty quickly during the landing phase and I was unaware that this flap problem states that the flap handle NOT be changed. There is not time to complete the QRH while on short final. I will review the QRH again to see if there are any more landing issues that have steps in them that need to be done/not done prior to the go-around and then have time to complete the QRH.		[No substantive additional information was gleaned from the secondary narrative.]		When the flaps refused to extend to the selected landing position as they were configuring for landing, the flight crew of a B737-700 initiated a go around and, in violation of the associated abnormal checklist, inadvertently operated the flap handle in response to the go around commands proper for an aircraft with properly responding flaps. They reconfigured the handle to conform to the position of the flaps and made an uneventful landing.

Following takeoff, turning from eastbound around a rain cell near the Atlantic shoreline, to the northwest to eventually join the departure with Departure Control, and passing 10,000 FT, VMC on top of all local weather, the pilot not flying noticed fuel imbalance, right wing lower by 600-800 LBS than the left wing tank. Requested stop climb at 11,000 and remain in the vicinity of the departure airport while troubleshooting problem. Running abnormal fuel imbalance checklist lead to right engine shut down and uneventful emergency landing back at our departure airport, slightly above maximum landing weight and following smooth touch down and rollout the ARFF crew double checked the aircraft for fuel leaks or any hot spots then followed the aircraft to the gate. Adherence to and disciplined timely use of flight prescribed checklists helped catch this fuel system imbalance before structural or flying quality changes may have challenged this crew beyond their abilities. The crews also choose to remove themselves from further flying following the stressful event to decompress and share lessons learned. Maintenance preliminary findings determined the leak was somewhere between the fueling/defueling manifold and the right engine, further maintenance trouble shooting will eventually isolate the problem for future reductions of this type event.		I had this same scenario two months prior and so I communicated my belief that we had a fuel leak on the right side. I suggested to the pilot not flying that he run the QRH procedure for fuel imbalance (IMBAL) and fuel leak, and that we needed to turn back to land. Pilot not flying agreed and began running the QRH IMBAL, and fuel leak procedures. Pilot not flying also worked to coordinate the emergency return with the cabin crew and made a PA advising the passengers. I continued to fly the aircraft and coordinated by radio with Air Traffic Control to return for a landing. While descending on a base leg to final pilot not flying and I coordinated to shutdown the right engine in accordance with the Fuel Leak QRH procedure. Pilot not flying also reviewed single approach and missed approach procedures. After a series of vector from Approach to help us loose the necessary, I intercepted final approach for the ILS. I flew the approach single engine with flaps 15 according to procedure. The approach and landing were uneventful, though we did land at about 1,000 LBS over maximum landing weight. Pilot not flying elected to stop straight ahead on the runway for fire crews to inspect the aircraft for fuel leaks, hot brakes, or any other anomalies. Not were noted so the Captain taxied aircraft to the gate with fire response team escort. Passengers were deplaned at the gate and the aircraft was turned over to Maintenance. This is the second engine shutdown I have experienced in the last two months. In both instances, upon engine shutdown inflight (i.e., closing the engine and spar fuel valves) the leak was arrested. In the first instance, the leak was on the left side. In the current instance, the leak was on the right side. Though an odd coincidence, the two events do not appear to be related therefore I can offer no corrective action. In the second occurrence, prior to pushback from the original gate, the fueled stopped fueling at approximately 15,000 LBS when the indication for the left side of the fuel panel failed. Maintenance was called and upon arrival found the left side quantity indicator began to work again. Fueling was continued, and we departed shortly thereafter whereupon we encountered the leak on the right side. After returning to the gate a mechanic came into the aircraft to investigate the fuel leak. He later came into the aircraft and indicated that there was a crack found on the refueling coupler at the fueling panel (right wing).		A B737-800 crew identified a fuel leak after takeoff so they declared an emergency, completed the QRH, shut the engine down and returned to the departure airport where maintenance identified a crack somewhere in right wing fuel plumbing prior to the engine.

Radar showed heavy precipitation, but no convective activity, and there were flights landing ahead of us. The First Officer was the pilot flying and since the [reported weather was better than that which would require the Captain to fly the approach per our FOM] I thought it would be a fairly straightforward event. At 1,000 FT we encountered the heavy rain, airspeed held steady with negligible wind gusts, and the wipers were selected to high. The First Officer reported to me around 600 FT that he was starting to pick up some lights, which I thought was odd since we I couldn't see any. I immediately began to think he was mistaking some lights on the ground for the approach lights and I instantly became very sensitive to the possibility that something might go wrong. At the 'approaching minimums' call, the First Officer reported 'landing' and disengaged the autopilot and autothrottles. It was raining so hard at this time that I personally could only see the runway between sweeps of the wipers, so that it was as if you were seeing a stop motion picture only about 40% of the time. I was worried about drift and our ability to assure a proper touchdown when I perceived that the VASI lights were moving towards our flight path. While the First Officer, who was flying, made no comment about the situation, I had an overwhelming sense that we were in imminent danger and without delay shouted 'go around!' The First Officer immediately performed a go-around and we climbed out. I really don't know how low we were at that moment, but I'm guessing we were below 100 FT. We leveled off at 4,000 FT and got ourselves situated. I explained my perceptions to the First Officer and stated that I would be more comfortable flying the next approach on the HUD with a flap setting of 40 vice the 30 setting we had just used. We re-briefed the approach, went through the HGS checklist, talked about our fuel state and divert options, made a PA to the passengers, and hooked back in for another go at it.I made the next approach and landing. It helped a great deal (for me anyway) to be able to have the HGS guidance and to be flying the plane. We touched down uneventfully in heavy rain and experienced fair braking, much less than you normally get on a wet runway. We pulled into the gate and shut down and I noticed my hands were shaking a bit. You know, you don't want to be mean guy to your First Officer and tell him that you'd feel more comfortable flying because he's on probation and you really don't trust him, but having the HUD and 16 years experience vice his 8 months would really give me the warm and fuzzies. This guy was a great pilot and a good guy and what happened probably had nothing to do with him, but can I be honest with you guys in safety and tell you this scared the crap out of me? I really, no kidding, thought for a moment we were about to land off the runway.I'm sure I'm not seeing the whole picture, but whatever you all find out, I'm sure I will be using this as (yet another) learning experience.In the future I could: 1. hold until heavy rain clears the final; 2. use the HUD more; 3. not be reluctant to take the aircraft and fly the approach myself if I think it would offer a better level of safety.				A B737-700 Captain, concerned that his First Officer was visually continuing a low minima approach in heavy rains based on inaccurate assessment of the visible runway environment, directed a go-around at low altitude. A second successful approach was flown by the Captain assisted by a HUD system accessible to him in the left seat.

Just prior to being cleared, we were told that gliders were in the area. Passing through approximately 11,000' MSL my First Officer spotted the glider at 12 o'clock and co-altitude.  When I saw the glider, they were turning to the left and going away from us.  I disengaged the autopilot and flew the aircraft manually to the right to increase the distance between us. As we passed abeam the glider, the distance was less than 1000' and less than a mile. We were still in communication with Approach, so we told the Controller the gliders position, which was now above us.  The Controller called back to confirm the glider was 'above us as we passed below 10,000' MSL.' Having gliders without transponders is a real threat to other aircraft that cannot see them, especially when gliders have a very small profile head on or tail to you. I hope this report finds the right people in charge to protect the flying public from airborne hazards that could be avoided by installing a transponder.				A B737 took evasive action from a glider at about 10,000' while descending for a daylight visual approach to TUS Runway 11L. Suggest transponder equipped gliders near airports.

Identified on the lower ECAM the RH side spoiler panels 2, 3, 4 were extended. This was accompanied by a continuous noise from aircraft right. Captain was PF, autopilot was off, and rudder trim is normal '0.2R'. A normal landing was made and upon touchdown ground spoilers deployed on schedule. After landing all spoilers retracted normally. I followed up with Captain, and asked the question about a low altitude go around with a single side spoilers deployed in regards to Airbus flight characteristics, if the spoilers did not retract with spoiler deactivation.	The reporter could not add any information except to state that the company is looking into it. The subject of disarming the spoilers was briefly considered during approach and rejected since the aircraft was stable and the possible negative consequences were unknown.			A320 First Officer reports noticing right hand roll spoilers 2, 3, and 4 are extended during approach with noticeable aircraft yawing and a continuous noise. There were no ECAM messages and the Beta target was well displaced out to the right but remained green. Captain elects to continue the approach to landing where all spoilers extend normally on touch down and retract normally when disarmed.

Initially high on the path, we were correcting in VNAV, and rolled the FAF altitude into the MCP when cleared the visual approach.  Descent rate was high and correcting, and as we approached 5,000 FT, it was evident terrain would be a factor, and the Captain directed me to climb, as we got the Terrain Caution and visual symbol on the Map display.  Approach also alerted us we were below MVA for the area as we were climbing.  Once clear of the terrain, we descended to 5,000 FT MSL and completed the visual approach without incident.  When faced with a time-sensitive change to the briefed approach, ensure fully re-briefing the new game plan, not just loading the correct data into the FMC.  Most importantly here is verbalize the terrain issue and step-down altitudes because they were not in the LEGS page due to being cleared direct the FAF, preventing a safe VNAV descent path.				B737-700 First Officer reports descending below MVA during a night visual approach to Runway 11L at TUS after a last minute runway change from Runway 29R. The reporter was attempting to descend to the FAF altitude prior to reaching CALLS. The crew, ATC, and the EGPWS all became concerned at the same time and corrective action was taken.

Noise sounded like a loud whine and continued to get louder until stopping suddenly. VENT EXTRACT FAULT ECAM message appeared concurrently with switch fault light and strong electrical odor/smoke in cockpit. Pilots donned oxygen masks and established communication with each other and cabin crew. QRC was accomplished as well as reference actions and checklist for VENT EXTRACT FAULT ECAM. First Officer flew plane to the divert airport while Captain ran checklists and managed situation. Captain directed First Officer to continue descending at 300 KTS below 10,000 FT to expedite arrival at the divert airport. After visual scan by Crash/Fire rescue personnel, aircraft taxied to gate. Cabin crew was briefed during descent and two PA announcements were made to passengers to keep them updated. Captain's overall impression is that everyone did a great job. The First Officer performed admirably, the Lead Flight Attendant stated during the debrief his complete satisfaction and thoroughness in the Cockpit/Cabin communications. ATC provided expedited handling and the ARFF crews were by the runway during our landing.		During cruise flight, noticed a noise followed by a VENT FAN ECAM. Cockpit immediately filled with an electric, burning type smell. Did not see any smoke. O2 mask donned, crew communication established. Ran ECAM, no effect. Started to divert, I stayed on controls and handled the radio. Captain ran Smoke/Fumes Checklist. Smell did not dissipate.

We started watching him and realized he was probably also headed directly for VESKA. As he got closer, it appeared that we would only have about 2 NM separation if nothing was done. The Center prior to being handed off to Port-Au-Prince, did not respond to our inquiry about the other aircraft. When it became apparent that we were on our own, we turned early before VESKA and initiated a climb. We had the other aircraft in sight by this time and could see that he was not changing course or altitude. While in the climb, we got an RA to climb at 1,000 FPM. We complied with the RA and increased our rate of climb. We leveled off about FL388 and then returned to FL380. Our separation at the closest point was about 500 FT and 4 NM. No other aircraft were in the immediate area according to our TCAS. Identification, we were unable to get Center to respond to our inquiries about the other aircraft at our altitude approaching VESKA. Center gave us a hand-off to Port-Au-Prince and I told him about the RA. It turns out he gave us the wrong frequency and we had to find the correct Port-Au-Prince frequency on our own. I told Center and Port-Au-Prince about the RA. Nobody seemed all that concerned. Port-Au-Prince came back a minute later and wanted to verify that I'd said we had an RA. Also, there was no sign whatsoever that the other aircraft saw us or heard us. Response, after the event we sent an ACARS message to Dispatch informing them of the RA. They responded that they were making the required report. On initial contact with Center, he said 'RADAR contact.' Later on, he asked our estimate for VESKA. Although he never said 'RADAR service terminated' I suspected he didn't have RADAR contact with us anymore. In the future I will ask the controller if I suspect he's lost RADAR contact. We were monitoring guard but got too busy when we got close to VESKA to try to contact the other aircraft. In the future I will make an early attempt to use guard to get ATC's and the other aircraft's attention.				Air Carrier with foreign Center experienced a conflict event, observing traffic for up to 80 miles but unable to contact ATC facility, the reporter noting 'guard' frequency should have be used in this instance.

Then our airspeed dropped 30 KTS and altitude dropped 400 FT from our peak. We nosed the aircraft down in an effort to maintain airspeed. I called ATC and advised them of our immediate descent. We encountered moderate turbulence during the descent. We leveled at FL370. No injuries to passengers or crew because they were seated and galleys were secure. No airframe limits were reached. No traffic conflicts were encountered.		The mountain wave had been reported as moderate, but I thought our experience was moderate to severe.		A B737-800 encountered a mountain wave encounter that caused large airspeed and altitude excursions.

First Officer, who was pilot flying, announced 'airspeed failure, take controls'. Captain immediately took controls and executed a normal takeoff profile. First Officer reverted to pilot not flying. Captain asked me to complete after takeoff checklist, coordinate for a return with Departure Control and Dispatch. With autopilot 1 engaged, FMGC programmed, all checklists complete and on vectors, First Officer's air data switch was selected to AD3 with no restoration of speed tape. Switch was returned to normal and back to AD3 with a successful restoration of airspeed indication. [We] executed an uneventful landing.		Just prior to 100 KTS, First Officer (pilot flying) announced 'Airspeed failure, Take Priority'; I took control and decided the safest course of action was to continue the take off vs. a high speed rejected take off. All normal procedures and checklists were followed. After the Takeoff checklist was completed the First Officer selected air data first officer on 3. The airspeed still showed failed. We decided the prudent and safest course of action was to land at the nearest airport--returning [to departure airport]. A non-emergency request to return was made, we notified Dispatch, completed all associated checklists and a normal uneventful landing was accomplished. It should be noted that a second attempt selecting First Officer on 3 did restore his airspeed indications.		A320 flight crew reports First Officer's airspeed failure at 100 KTS during takeoff. The Captain assumes control and continues the takeoff. First attempt at switching the First Officer to AD3 is unsuccessful and the crew elects to return to the departure airport, although the second attempt is successful.

MOC recommended compliance with ECAM action to land ASAP.  As a result I declared an emergency and continued to an overweight, but uneventful landing at the nearest suitable airport. Subsequent Maintenance inspection revealed chaffed wiring from the EEC. [It is of interest that our] aircraft was on MEL: 'ENGINE 2 MINOR FAULT.'  Immediate correction of this MEL may have revealed the underlying wiring 'short' that lead to the subsequent ENG 2 THR LEVER Disagreement.				An A330 flight crew delayed taking action on an ECAM thrust lever disagreement message which directed a landing 'ASAP.'

When the aircraft finally arrived at the gate, Maintenance advised us a line on the Green Hydraulic System had failed and it would be over five hours before the aircraft would be repaired. We finally pushed, and had a normal departure. After reaching cruise and upon performing a HEFOE (Hydraulic Electrical Fuel Oxygen Engine) check, we noticed the green system quantity was somewhat lower than normal. As we proceeded westbound, it was apparent the quantity indicator was indeed decreasing. We notified Maintenance of the condition and asked if we could turn off the green system pump thinking that maybe the suspected leak would decrease in intensity, but was told to abide by the QRH procedures. By this time we had already reviewed the QRH, and had not found any procedure for our situation. When the quantity indicator was within 1/8 inch of the amber low level line, we asked Dispatch if maybe a diversion would be appropriate. They concurred, so we told Center we were going to divert for a precautionary landing. Apparently someone declared an emergency for us as the equipment met us upon landing and followed us to the gate. Maintenance was still troubleshooting the situation when we left the airport.				A320 Captain reports departing late due to a maintenance required repair of the Green hydraulic system. Once in cruise the Green system quantity is found to be decreasing and the crew elects to divert.

Aircraft was towed from runway to Gate. A [hydraulic] leak was noted at the left Main Landing Gear (MLG) Down Lock actuator flex hose, inboard of the two flex lines. A replacement line was shipped in from ZZZ1 and installed per Aircraft Maintenance Manual 32-11-22 'Installation of Lock Stay' actuator hose. After installation, hydraulics was serviced to required level and ran engines and operated flight controls to move hydraulics though Green System. A Functional Test was required AMM 32-31-00, but thought brace tool was gear safety collars and the Functional Test was completed. Green System hydraulics was again serviced to proper level. Aircraft released to service. [I] was called by our ZZZ Maintenance Manager that Aircraft X had lost Green System hydraulics's and was diverting to ZZZ2. [Realized] I misinterpreted a step in the Functional Test. Then looked into what this brace tool was. [Recommend]: 1) Confer with more Aviation Maintenance Technicians AMTs on understanding [AMM] terminology. 2) This job, I have seen been accomplished and no problems occurred as this. 3) When I selected the AMM reference, AMM 32-31-00-710, this reference was right below the one I should have selected, AMM 32-31-00-720.	Reporter stated he has 29-years of Mechanic experience with two airlines. Many of the misunderstandings in reading Airbus Aircraft Maintenance Manuals (AMM) involve Airbus terminology compared to Boeing AMMs. The purpose of the lock stay brace tool was not explained in the Airbus AMM. Only that a procedure had to be performed involving the Lock Stay Down Lock actuator because the hydraulic hose to the down lock actuator had broken away from the actuator in flight where the flex line attach fitting connects to the hose. The separated hose caused an excessive loss of Green System hydraulic fluid.Reporter stated their Line Station does not have any facilities; no Hangar to do gear swings and did not have a brace tool to accomplish cycling of the lock stay down lock actuator after they had replaced the broken flex hose. He selected one of two alternate procedures in the Airbus AMM that allows for installing gear pins, 'slugging' the main gear and moving the gear handle up and down to check for hydraulic pressure and any leaks at the actuator hose fittings on the down lock actuator; without having to do an actual gear swing. Unfortunately he selected the wrong alternate procedure. Reporter stated that since the broken flex line caused the loss of hydraulic Green System hydraulic fluid, Airbus requires a 'priming' of the Green System by actuating the down lock actuator numerous times with the brace tool installed, which was not done since they did not have a brace tool at their Station. The same hose seems to break or leak fairly often, probably due to the constant flexing of the hose at the actuator connection and the fact that the hose is exposed when the gear is extended. Although they did operate the gear doors, flight controls, run the engines and service the Green System to required levels, the A320 Green System quantity dropped and the flight diverted halfway to their destination. The diversion was not due to actual hydraulic fluid loss. The Green System just required more fluid to replenish the System. They now have a brace tool at their Line Station.			A Line Mechanic reports that misunderstandings of terminology used in Airbus Aircraft Maintenance Manuals (AMM) compared to Boeing AMMs and the lack of an Airbus Brace Tool led to an A320 diversion due to low Green System hydraulic fluid. A hydraulic flex hose to the Lock Stay, Down Lock actuator on the left Main Gear had broken on a previous flight.

We were given the La Guardia 4 Departure WHITESTONE CLIMB as our departure clearance. I then called LGA Clearance to verify La Guardia 4 Departure with the WHITESTONE CLIMB along with the current ATIS and transponder code. Prior to pushback, the Captain and I thoroughly briefed the WHITESTONE Departure during the clearance brief. After pushback, we taxied to the runway and were cleared for takeoff. At 400 FT, we began the right turn per the WHITESTONE Departure.At 500 FT, the Tower Controller told us to fly the NTHNS 1 RNAV Departure. I hesitated to answer because I initially didn't understand what the clearance was. He then asked if we could comply. I stated, 'No.' He then gave us a 050 heading and we continued the climb to 5,000 FT. We were then given a 360 heading. We were then told to contact Departure. I told the Controller that if he wanted us to fly the departure, he should have let us known prior to takeoff. I checked in with New York Departure, and we were given immediate vectors around the weather. Once we were clear of the weather, the Controller asked if we had time for a question. I said 'go ahead.' He asked if we were unable to fly the NTHNS 1 Departure. I told him that we could fly the departure if we had been given prior notice. I told him the Tower Controller did not give us any prior notice and therefore we had no time to prepare for the change from the WHITESTONE CLIMB to the NTHNS 1. 500 AGL was not the time to totally change our departure. He said, 'Okay, and said it was not a problem.'I believe the proper measures were in place. The PDC was right. I verified the clearance with Clearance Delivery. The problem is that ATC cannot change the clearance at 500 AGL without any prior notice. I believe this was an ATC error. Someone forgot to amend our departure clearance prior to takeoff.		I actually have no idea exactly what SID the Controller stated. Almost immediately, he asked if we could comply. I told the First Officer to tell him that we were unable. ...the Controller asked us (in so many words) why we were unable to comply with the new SID the Tower wanted us to fly. Due to thunderstorms in the area, the Departure Controller gave us vectors to avoid thunderstorm cells. This event created high stress for the flight crew during a high workload phase of flight topped off with thunderstorms in the vicinity.		Although cleared via PDC to fly the complex LA GUARDIA SID, WHITESTONE CLIMB the flight crew of a B737-700 was asked immediately after takeoff to, instead, fly the NTHNS RNAV SID due to weather. The flight crew responded unable due to workload required and the lack of time to adapt to the change. ATC provided vectors around the weather.

The other two passed under the left wing at about 500 FT. ATC was notified. No altitude or navigation deviations occurred.This is the first time I have seen this type of aircraft in this area. Some type of FAA circular should be sent to the owners of those types of aircraft in the area warning them of the danger of a 150-knot airplane running over them in the departure corridor.

I tried several times to select managed speed and was forced by the aircraft (it was pitching up trying incorrectly to achieve 250 KIAS) to return to selected speed and after three attempts found myself almost 1,000 FT above path. (I wrote up the anomalies upon arrival in LAX).In order to make my restriction of 17,000 FT/280 KTS at KONZL, I selected full speed brakes and disconnected the autopilot (in order to get full spoiler deflection). We monitored our speed and vertical path and managed to meet the constraint airspeed and altitude at KONZL. As we approached ENGLI we noticed that we were starting to descend below the constraint altitude approximately two and a half miles prior to the fix. I pushed V/S to stop our descent and was surprised that we continued a gentle descent. At the same time we noticed that the NAV display was indicating that we were 0.3 miles right of course centerline. At this time the First Officer noticed that we were not following the Flight Director. I realized that after stowing the speed brake we had never reengaged the autopilot and the airplane had been tracking pitch and roll attitude in Control Wheel Steering since the speed brakes had been stowed.We crossed close abeam ENGLI at approximately 15,600 FT (almost 400 FT below constant altitude). A quick visual scan and scan of the TCAS indicated that we were not in danger of a midair collision. A gentle correction to our descent rate reestablished us on path and the autopilot was reengaged. We advised ATC that we were going to miss our altitude constraint at ENGLI. The rest of the approach was flown within parameters and without incident.The event was caused by our distraction with equipment malfunction and failure to remain aware of the autopilot disconnect. Because Control Wheel Steering is the automatic default in the A320 it can easily be mistaken for an autopilot engaged mode.We needed better delineation of pilot flying and pilot not flying duties. Only close attention to the path allowed us to catch it (the autopilot disconnect) as early as we did.				An A320 Captain discussed the effects of flight crew confusion and distraction associated with a malfunctioning vertical navigation programming on flight path control and situational awareness.

They must have just been off idle because after pulling on them I was able to get into reverse. During this time ATC asked us to exit left at Bravo and the Captain responded. Approaching 60 KTS I tried to exit reverse and was unable to. The Captain took the thrust levers and closed the reversers. By this time we were going past Bravo and exited at Alpha. During the taxi in Ground notified the Captain to call them and he was informed that a takeoff clearance had to be cancelled because we had missed Bravo. At the gate the Captain wrote up the right thrust reverser which had a light illuminated on the overhead panel.				When a B737-800 flight crew experienced difficulty both entering and exiting reverse thrust after landing they were unable to make the turnoff requested by the Tower. The Captain was asked to contact the Tower and, when he did so, was advised the Local Controller had had to cancel a takeoff clearance when they failed to exit where requested.

The GEELA Arrival has been printed with different errors in the last two revision cycles, and corrected with NOTAMS and manual changes to the route in the database over the last several months. They finally appear to have gotten it right, though apparently not right enough that they can just let us fly it as published. The current version has eleven altitude restrictions (many of them include two altitudes to be between) and five speed restrictions. We had programmed the arrival into the FMC, and briefed all the waypoints, altitudes, and speeds. We were then cleared for the arrival, but told to maintain 250 knots. More programming. Then ATC vectored us off the arrival. When cleared to descend 'via' the arrival, we set 4000 feet into the Altitude window. Since we were now off the arrival, we didn't want to descend to 4000 feet, so had to wait for a break in the radio traffic and clarify which altitude to descend to. The Controller did not appear to understand the problem but--on the second try--issued us an altitude that we were very rapidly approaching and for which had to abruptly level off. Then he gave us another vector back onto the arrival, and recleared us to descend via the arrival. I asked if he still needed the 250 knots, and he said, 'That will work.' I assured him that it wouldn't, as the next point had a 265 knot restriction, and the one two more down the road was at 230 knots. He then clarified that we should maintain 250 now, and then comply after HYDRR (250 knot restriction, there). In the time [it took to resolve this issue] we had gone through FL180...both of us had set our altimeters, but the continued conversation with ATC distracted us from doing the Descent Checklist until about 13,000 feet.Phoenix has about the most complex arrivals that we fly, but apparently they don't work. I would suggest that they either be simplified to allow ATC more flexibility or not issued as a clearance if they are going to be routinely interrupted. Between the extra workload of programming (and reprogramming) them, briefing (and then re-briefing) them, and coordinating the changes to them with ATC, it is overly distracting in an already busy phase of flight. At the very least, they need to understand the ramifications of their changes.		Multiple speed assignments and incomplete clearances increased our arrival workload to the point that we accomplished our Descent Checklist late and almost forgot to turn the seatbelt sign on prior to landing. While still cruising at FL250, ATC had assigned 280 knots. Later on the arrival, we were told to comply with the speeds on the arrival. We had not yet been cleared to 'Descend 'via' the GEELA 6,' so we asked if we were cleared to descend 'via' the arrival, and then, for the first time, we were in fact cleared to descend 'via' the GEELA 6 Runway 7R transition. This was a blatant case of over control and it creates an environment prone to errors. ABQ Center and PHX Approach are over controlling airplanes on all the arrivals into PHX, and it is frustrating. We are trying to be good citizens and comply with the Controller instructions, but it is clear that they are not seeing this from a flight crew's perspective. The issuance of speeds while VNAVing on an arrival has the potential to cause missed altitude restrictions. Clearances off of the arrival without a new altitude is wrong. Once cleared for the arrival, they need to let us fly it - period.		A B737-700 flight crew reported their concerns about ATC's frequent re-clearances given to aircraft previously cleared to descend 'via' the complex RNAV STARs into PHX.

When we got to the airplane, the maintenance paperwork indicated everything had been fixed.  Two hours into the flight, the left wing tank showed a 20,000 LB imbalance with the right wing tank showing more fuel.  The 'fuel disagree' checklist popped up and we started to complete it.  Before completion, the total fuel indication disappeared along with the left wing fuel indications.  We now, only had a right wing fuel indication.  The 'Fuel Disagree' checklist was inadequate for this situation.  We then elected to do the 'Fuel Leak' checklist and found it also inadequate, without a total fuel reading.  The same was true for the 'Fuel Imbalance' checklist.  After contact with Dispatch and Maintenance, it was concluded that a fuel leak was possible, but could not be verified visually, or by checklist.  Without being sure the airplane was not leaking fuel, an immediate diversion was planned.  Under this situation, we found the 'Fuel Disagree,' 'Fuel Leak,' and the 'Fuel Imbalance' checklists, inadequate to determine with certainty, whether the airplane was leaking fuel, or if the fuel sensors were the problem.  Making the wrong assumption could lead to a serious problem.				B777 Captain experiences a left fuel tank quantity indication failure in cruise, which also causes the failure of the total fuel indication.  A fuel imbalance indication had briefly annunciated before the quantity failure and without any method to determine if a fuel leak existed the crew elects to divert.

As we were cleared to position and hold the Captain accomplished the takeoff configuration warning  check. We did not get a takeoff warning horn. The check was completed, we went on to complete the takeoff checklist.  Before we were able to fully line up on the runway the Tower cleared us for takeoff. The Captain (flying pilot) stood up the power levers and I called 'stable.' Captain pressed the TO/GA switch and called 'set takeoff power.' I called 'takeoff power set,' we accelerated normally down the runway, I called '80 KTS.' The Captain responded 'checks,' I looked at the engine instruments one more time they were still all stable as we passed 110 KTS.  The intermittent cabin altitude/configuration warning horn sounded and we aborted the takeoff at 110 KTS at 149.1 LBS. I called 'speedbrake, 100 KTS, 90 KTS.' And at this time the Captain stowed the speedbrake to disarm the autobrake, so we wouldn't come to a screeching halt. We had plenty of runway left and the RTO was violent enough already.  We exited the runway called Dispatch and talked to Maintenance Control to try to understand why the takeoff configuration warning sounded. We brought the jet back to the gate after exiting the runway, stopping the jet, and talking to the flight attendants and then making an announcement to the passengers. The Captain did a great job not only with the aborted takeoff, but also with passengers and crew.		[Narrative 2 had no additional information].		A B737-800 flight crew reported rejecting takeoff at 110 KTS when the configuration horn sounded for unknown reasons.

The Captain stepped back for a bathroom break.  The copilot was alert, however; he shut his eyes and then his head tilted down.  When the Captain returned after a few minutes, it was copilot's turn to take a rest break.  He took several minutes to arise.  I called his name, pushed on his shoulder, then pulled back his chair.  He arose and went back for his rest break seeming groggy.  Because he took longer than normal to arise, and would now be in the back, out of sight and alone for two hours on his break, we wanted to confirm that nothing medically wrong had occurred.  The Captain talked to Dispatch then Medlink, then solicited the help of a doctor in first class.  He was examined and passed all tests for alertness, understanding, reactions, blood pressure, etc.  This was done within about 15 minutes of the initial occurrence.  He occupied the jumpseat after his rest break and for the landing, only as a precaution.  For the duration of the flight he appeared normal in every way and performed pilot duties normally.		Just before leaving the cockpit for my previously-scheduled rest break, I dozed off unintentionally, and was apparently very difficult to awaken.  Once awake, I went to the forward galley and chatted with the Flight Attendant, asked for a snack if one was available, then went to the sleeper seat.  I ate my food at a leisurely pace, popped in some earplugs and turned out the lights to take some sleep.  Shortly thereafter I was awakened by the purser, who was in the company of a medical doctor.  The doctor had been asked by the Captain to perform an evaluation of my condition, and it appears from her report that I was just fine.  Which is exactly how I felt.  I returned to the cockpit later to take over the duties of relief pilot.		A B777 Relief Pilot reported that as she is about to relieve the flying First Officer, he nods off and was very difficult to awaken.  As a precaution the Captain had the First Officer examined by an on board physician and the relief pilot assume the First Officer's position.

Upon additional observation, we determined our flight path would be well above the clouds.  We also noted two aircraft ahead on the same route, both at FL360.  We asked ATC if any aircraft ahead on our route had encountered adverse conditions or deviated due to weather.  ATC responded that no such actions or reports had occurred.  Our flight remained in smooth conditions and several minutes later entered and remained in hazy cloud conditions, thus restricting our visibility.  We noted the aircraft ahead not changing altitude or route.  A few minutes later we encountered convective, windshear-type activity which initially caused the aircraft to accelerate and begin to climb.  Almost immediately thereafter, the aircraft rapidly decelerated and began to descend.  The autopilot went to CWS mode. The PF disconnected the autopilot in order to manually control aircraft attitude. The autothrottles continued to function. The PF acted to override the autothrottles as necessary to respond to the rapid changes in airspeed. The PNF immediately illuminated the seat belt sign and, via the P.A., notified the passengers and flight attendants to remained seated with seat belts fastened. The PNF then requested a lower altitude from ATC. ATC cleared us to descend to and maintain FL370. During the convective activity the aircraft climbed a few hundred FT, then descended approximately 1,000 FT. Our airspeed initially increased approximately ten KTS, then decreased approximately 20-30 KTS. During the encounter we experienced stick shaker intermittently and difficulty maintaining airspeed and altitude.  Maintaining a desired descent rate was also intermittently very difficult. Approximately 60-90 seconds after the beginning of the encounter we entered clear air with good visibility, no windshear-type activity, and smooth conditions.  We leveled the aircraft at FL370.  The PNF confirmed with ATC our clearance at FL370.  He then confirmed with the flight attendants their safety and that of all passengers.  He also notified ATC and company Dispatch of the location and type of conditions we experienced.  The flight continued to our destination normally. On the ground, the Captain further discussed the encounter with Dispatch via telephone and ACARS.  I would suggest a greater distance of deviation from any convective weather would lessen the likelihood of such an event.  This type of greater deviation should be taken any time convective activity is suspected or unsure. This type of greater deviation should be taken regardless of ATC reports or lack thereof. This type of greater deviation should be taken regardless of a lack of reports from other aircraft.				A B737-700 encountered convective windshear activity at FL400 which resulted in a 10 KT speed increase with a climb, followed by a 20-30 FT speed decrease and a 1,000 FT altitude loss with the stick shaker.

Followed non-ECAM abnormal procedure (windshield crack).  Conferred with Dispatch and the decision was made to divert to a nearby airport due to enroute forecast icing conditions.  Descended to lower altitude to reduce landing weight, but encountered turbulence.  Completed windshield crack procedure prior to landing and followed overweight landing procedures as a precaution (FMGC predicted the landing weight within limits, but may have been inaccurate due to SID).  Complied with international divert procedures upon arrival at gate.  Repositioned aircraft to domestic gate after clearing customs.  Determined crew needed to enter rest after confirming with Maintenance Control that no immediate fix was possible and Dispatch had no options for replacement aircraft.  Calculated supplemental rest requirements and coordinated with crew planning for hotel assignment. I would suggest more accurate FMGC fuel prediction would aid crews in determining forecast landing weight quickly to avoid the potential for landing overweight.				An A320 ECAM alerted R WINDOW HEAT INOP accompanied by a large single crack which minutes later developed into a completely cracked window, so the flight diverted to a nearby airport to avoid enroute weather.

Last night while approaching SEA I had another simultaneous dual FMS failure. After landing the FO told me he had recently seen the exact same thing. When briefing the Captain who was taking the aircraft out of SEA, he told me that he too had experienced a recent dual FMS failure, and that he had just flown with another FO who had experienced two of them. From these discussions, I learned that all of these happened at the exact same point in the flight; when? Cleaning up the box? After being vectored off of the arrival STAR. For at least a year I have frequently used the technique of selecting 'No Star' under 'Arrivals' after being vectored off of the STAR. This would result in the box automatically entering all of the fixes on the loaded approach, along with the crossing altitudes. This saves a lot of time in the approach environment, and is useful at time such as when ORD TRACON vectors you off one of the southeast arrivals with a turn to intercept the 27L ILS, which has multiple step-downs which must be complied with. In the case of my two FMS failures, I had just entered 'No Star.' I noticed that the fixes on the ILS did not automatically load as I have seen in my previous experience. I then attempted to clear out the remaining waypoints from the STAR we had just been vectored off of. That is when both boxes failed simultaneously. 'No Map' was displayed on the ND's, initially the FMS froze and would not respond to any input, then everything was dumped and the orange FMS-1 (and FMS-2 respectively) came on each box. This also causes the pressurization system to lose its landing field elevation value requiring manual over-ride. Also, the landing ref airspeed dumps too. The outbound Captain I spoke with last night said that he does not use the 'No Star' technique I described above, but that his FMS failure did occur when he went to 'clean up the box' after being vectored off of a STAR. I would suggest that someone look into whether there is some systemic issue with a recent data-base update or software change to our FMS's. I know I'm preaching to the choir, but this type of failure occurs at a very inopportune time in the flight. I was fortunate in that both of the failures I experienced occurred in VMC. Had we been IMC we definitely would have had to perform a go-around as it takes a bit of time to get an ILS hard-tuned with an inbound course in Rad-Nav and selected on Rose-ILS, and the pressurization issue has to be dealt with too. It's not a good situation.	The reporter's research indicates that other methods of cleaning up the approach can cause the dual FMGC failures and that the failures seem limited to arrivals to SEA and CLE only. His company is currently working on the issue.

While climbing with autopilot engaged (as pilot flying) we received clearance to 'Climb to 280.' I believe First Officer readback 'Climb 17 for 280.' First Officer reset altitude set window and pointed; I confirmed FL280 by pointing and [stating] verbally '280'. As we were climbing through FL180 ATC called with '[Company] say altitude climbing to.' First Officer responded 'FL280.' ATC said 'Stop your climb, descend to 17,000. Then Controller said, 'I said turn to heading 280.' First Officer reset altitude to 17,000. I stopped climb at 18,200 FT. We reset our altimeters to last setting and descended to 17,000. After level, First Officer queried ATC with 'Are we having or going to have any issues?' ATC Controller said 'No.' At no time was there any doubt in either of our minds that we were cleared to FL280 by this Controller. This was a correctly applied procedure with readback of our ATC instructions by this crew to this Controller, and we were professional in all of our procedures and techniques.		[Narrative 2 contains no additional information.]		B737-800 flight crew heard and read back clearance from Center Controller to 'climb to 280.' During subsequent climb, Controller advised flight crew that the clearance was for 'heading 280.'

I had been into MAF before and knew how it was located between the two towns. Both Pilots had trouble seeing the airport at first (outside 20 miles). We were navigating direct to MAF VOR which is about five miles north of MAF and I soon spotted the airport by using the Map display and orientation of Midland and Odessa. I was trying to help the Captain to find the airport while the Tower Controller was asking if we had [the airport in sight]. We asked for a vector for a right base to 16R. When the Captain first saw the airport, we were about six miles and approaching final course, but we were still too high to make a stable approach. We then asked Tower for a left 270 degree turn back to final. While we were making the turn and configuring flaps, the Captain had about 200-300 FPM descent with the autopilot on. Tower called some traffic near the airport and the Captain asked me what would be a good altitude to put in the window and I misjudged the pattern altitude at 4,000 FT MSL. As we were turning in the maneuver, we noticed some radio towers, one to my right and another to the Captain's left, so he leveled off the descent. At that same moment, the Tower gave us an altitude alert and to check our altitude. We were about 4,000 FT MSL and the Captain started to climb back up to 4,500 FT. We rolled out on final for 16R and continued to configure for landing, corrected our glidepath and made a normal landing to 16R. We did not receive any Ground Proximity Warnings or Alerts. I did have my terrain selected on my PFD and noticed many green square obstacles around the vicinity, but we were not too close or over any of them.		We were on a right base for the visual approach. When I finally acquired the runway, we were too high to turn onto final and we requested a left 270 degree turn back to final to lose the required altitude.		A B737-700 flight crew, cleared for a visual approach from a long left base to MAF Runway 16R, determined they were too high and requested a 270 degree turn to lose altitude and establish a stabilized approach. While doing so they allowed their altitude to get too low and the Tower advised of a low altitude alert. They corrected their rate of descent and contintued to an uneventful landing.

At one point, we were given descent to FL370 and soon after to continue to FL360. I entered FL370 in the Cruise page and selected VNAV. FL360 was in the MCP Altitude window, but we did not descend. Checking in with ABQ Center, we gave them our current altitude, and he asked us if we were given a restriction. At this point, we got confused after seeing FL360 in the MCP Altitude window. Center again queried us and we admitted that we weren't sure exactly what altitude we were to descend to. He then gave us the 'descend via' clearance and we proceeded uneventfully to Sky Harbor.		[No substantive additional information was included in the secondary report.]		A B737-700 flight crew failed to properly program ATC descent clearances into their FMS and Altitude Alert window and, thus, stopped their descent from FL400 at FL370 vice FL360.

We were given our initial descent from FL390 to FL330. During the descent, we were given a crossing restriction of 50 west of BFD at FL240. I put FL240 in the MCP and programmed the crossing restriction in the FMC. The aircraft was in a 1000 fpm descent as we were still below the path. At FL280 Chicago Center called and asked where we were. We responded FL280 with the restriction of FL240 50 west of BFD. I then noticed that we had left VNAV PATH and had arrived at the restriction of 50 west of BFD 4,000 FT high.		VNAV must have gone to Speed and we did not catch the change.		After receiving a crossing clearance 50W of BDF at FL240, the flight crew of a B737-700 failed to monitor autoflight performance and crossed at FL280.

All other systems were normal. We accomplished the procedure and then contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control. There appeared to be a discrepancy between the ECAM checklist and the AOM checklist that we referenced after accomplishing the ECAM. As I recall, the ECAM directed us to restore the PTU [Power Transfer Unit] in order to lower the landing gear. The AOM gave no such direction. Since our Green system quantity was almost zero, turning the PTU back on didn't seem to make sense. Maintenance Control agreed, and we left the PTU off for the rest of the flight. I briefed the Flight Attendents, declared an emergency and we landed in ZZZ. Because we had to gravity extend the landing gear, we had no nose wheel steering or normal brakes but backup systems worked as advertised. We did, however, have to wait for approximately 20 minutes to get towed off the runway.				When the flight crew of an A320 attempted to resolve a Green Hyd System 1 low pressure ECAM, they discovered a discrepancy between the ECAM Checklist and the more complete procedure in their Flight Manual as far as utilizing the PTU to extend the landing gear. They declared an emergency, landed safely and was towed to a gate after a 30 minute delay.

We asked them why? Tower informed us we had smoke coming out of the right wheel. We stopped the aircraft and requested the fire equipment. We informed the passengers to remain seated and not be alarmed and that there was no danger. We looked out the window at the tires there was no smoke. One tire was flat and the other tire on the right wheel well was stressed from the weight. We called Maintenance, Dispatch, and Operations to let them know what was going on. The Crash Captain showed up and said the wheel was not on fire, but flat. He also said the other wheel was not fully inflated. The Crash Captain said they took a thermal picture of the wheel and the brakes were cool. Maintenance called and said they did not think we should tow or taxi the aircraft. We obtained vans to take the passengers to baggage claim and got the ramp crew to unload the bags and take them to baggage claim. Maintenance changed the tire and found the right wheel brake had locked. We then de-briefed the crew. There were no injuries and all crew members and passengers were well. All crew members, firefighters, airport operations personal, air traffic controllers, ramp personal, station personal, performed their duties extremely well and displayed excellent crew coordination. The out board brake was locked on touchdown causing the tire to deflate.				A B737-800 Captain was informed by the Tower of smoke coming from the right main gear after landing. CFR was requested. The out board tire was found to be deflated and the brake on that wheel locked.

Noticed the steady rumble at the controls also immediately after clean up. Commented to the Captain that something was wrong when we got a Master Caution and Generator OFF Light on left engine. Cabin chimed about that time to say passengers thought spoilers were up on left side. I took the radios and continued to fly and informed ATC that we were declaring an emergency and requested level off at next altitude coming up which was 11,000. I started the APU and asked for vectors back around to land at the departure airport. The descent and configuring for landing were still controllable though the rumble continued. The engine, other than the generator, operated normally. The landing was normal at flaps 30 with auto brakes 2. Weather was CAVU and wind 260/4. The cowling departed the aircraft on landing, and I assume when I went into reverse. It was retrieved on the runway. No leaks or other damage was noted by fire trucks so we taxied back to the gate. Lost cowling to left engine which also cut generator for that engine.		After takeoff and during climb out there was a distinct vibration though the aircraft. Left generator fell off line. Flight attendants called stating that there was a metal object standing up at the left engine. Upon executing the QRH procedures for the Generator OFF Light I was able to get the generator to come back on line. We declared an emergency and landed back at the departure airport. Post inspection found out that the left engine outboard cowling was ripped off the engine. Airport personnel found the cowling on the departure runway which we had landed on. Aircraft was taken out of service.	The Reporter stated that an access panel on the upper left side of the left engine cowl was apparently not latched or the latch failed on takeoff. The result was that the panel was sticking up and appeared to a passenger to be part of the wing. After the panel unlatched it cut the left generator white feeder lines inside the cowling which tripped the generator OFF. The Reporter stated that the wires at top of area inside the access area were black where the panel sliced into them. The generator did reset and remained on line. During landing the panel metal tore and separated leaving only a small portion of it at the connecting fixture point.	After takeoff B737-800 passengers reported a spoiler up and the Generator OFF light alerted so an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport where a left engine access panel was discovered missing.

At about 120 KTS the Captain initiated an abort and I looked up from my scan of the instruments and saw an aircraft taxiing across the runway on Taxiway DIXIE. The abort went as per normal and I made a call to the Tower and a PA to the passengers as the Captain brought the ship to a stop off the runway at M14. We stopped at M/DIXIE Taxiways and ran through the procedures for post abort and then made calls to ground ramp and company for further guidance.

After we unsuccessfully cycled the landing gear lever three times we elected to do a go around and trouble shoot. After checking in the Flight Manual, checking for popped circuit breakers, and consulting with Maintenance we prepared for our return and successfully performed the Gravity Extension checklist on a long final.  During the conversation with Maintenance Control we were told that the same thing had happened eleven days previously. In our maintenance history the last entry went back thirteen days but there was no entry for the previous gear malfunction. This knowledge could have been quite beneficial. Our initial fuel load had us planned to land with 4.8 thousand pounds of fuel. Luckily we had increased this by 1,000 pounds prior to departure. Had we not increased the fuel load we would have had very little fuel time left to further troubleshoot our problem if the gravity extension was not successful.				An A320 flight crew was unable to lower their landing gear, initiated a go around, successfully conducted a gravity extension procedure and returned for a safe landing. Their fuel remaining could have compromised more extensive trouble shooting had the gravity extension not proven successful. A previous identical failure some 11 days before was not annotated in the logbook or in the flight crew's maintenance briefing message provided for flight planning.

I corrected with hard right rudder and pulled the nose off the ground to regain control. I believed for a split second we had an engine failure, but quickly determined that was not the case. After conferring with my First Officer we agreed that we had probably blown a nose wheel tire as the gear had retracted normally and advised Tower as such. We advised ATC we wanted to climb to 10,000 FT and assess the problem. After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance I decided it was in the best interest of safety to declare an emergency, burn off fuel to a reasonable landing weight and return to where I would be guaranteed to have a long runway. Dispatch had suggested that we could continue to destination due to the need to burn fuel off. My concern was in the possibility if something else were to cause us to have to divert to an airport with a short runway that we could be compromising control with heavy braking/max reverse. I established a normal max landing weight of 128,000 LBS as reasonable and Maintenance then informed us we were ok to do an overweight landing as it was within structural limits. I chose to keep 128,000 as I believed it provided us with a better safety margin. I briefed the lead Flight Attendant that as a precaution I would have her prepare the cabin and passengers for the brace command. I informed the passengers, highly emphasizing that this was precautionary only and that I fully expected a normal landing. At this time I also asked the Lead Flight Attendant to utilize a deadheading Flight Attendant as a crewmember and have her occupy the second aft jumpseat. On short final I commanded the brace position on the PA and landed slightly nose up with no use of braking or reverse thrust initially. When the nose wheel contacted the runway with approximately 6,000 FT remaining there was a distinct vibration/grinding and a noticeable bounce from the front. I used minimal braking, utilizing the excess runway length until as long as possible then applied normal braking and reverse thrust to bring the aircraft to a stop with approximately 2,000 FT remaining. CFR inspected the aircraft and said all tires appeared inflated; Maintenance then inspected and cleared us to taxi in. When I started to taxi it was apparent there was something wrong as there was a loud grinding noise and the nose was bouncing. I stopped and had Maintenance tow us to the gate. Maintenance removed the nose wheel assembly and told us the right tire was severely out of balance.				B737 Captain experiences a lurch to the left when passing V1 during takeoff. Once safely airborne the crew believes a tire failure may have occurred and elects to return to the departure airport after declaring an emergency and burning down to maximum landing weight. Maintenance discovers a nose tire to be severely out of balance.

Both the First Officer (pilot not flying) and I noticed a brief illumination of the LE Flap in Transit light. We consulted the QRH and performed the procedures for a flaps 15 landing. OPC data indicated a safe landing, and we asked for clearance to land. While configured at flaps 15 and landing gear down on speed, we received the same warning and stick shaker at 500 FT AGL and performed another go-around. I flew the aircraft and the pilot not flying contacted Maintenance for additional guidance. I advised ATC we were low fuel and needed a close in vector to perform the QRH procedure. ATC was congested and I declared a fuel emergency to get expedited handling back to the airport. I called the Flight Attendants and told them to prepare the cabin, but we expected not to evacuate the cabin. We computed OPC data for a flaps 15 landing and flew an uneventful approach and landing. Both pilot flying and pilot not flying were task saturated with ATC and Dispatch while performing QRH procedures. Had our fuel state been not as critical, I would have briefed the flight attendants more thoroughly.		The Captain did another go-around and after getting established at 3,000 FT MSL, I used VHF 2 to talk to Maintenance to see if they had any suggestions to assist us with the problem. He mentioned a possible sensor failure that could trigger the indications we received. Due to low fuel the Captain declared an emergency. We ran the checklist again and flew an uneventful flap 15 approach with normal flap indications. After landing the Captain advised the passengers that everything was okay and to stay seated. We taxied to the gate and shut down normally. Fuel at shutdown was 2.9. The most disconcerting thing about this situation was the Airspeed Low and stick shaker warnings. The checklist does not mention anything about getting these after you comply with checklist procedures and attempt a flaps 15 landing.		B737-700 flight crew reported stick shaker and 'Airspeed Low' warnings on approach. After a go-around and completion of procedure another approach was executed, where the stick shaker was again alive, triggering another go-around. A third approach was successfully completed.

After voicing his opinion, the First Officer asked the Captain to confirm his decisions with someone outside of the flight deck. Upon reaching the cruise altitude of FL340, the Captain called Company. After a bit of coordination and discussion via radio and ACARS, it was suggested that we land as soon as possible. We complied with no further complications. Note: The new Dispatch Release appears to have taken off the Operations frequencies associated with points along the route. This was a distraction.				A B737-800 Flight Crew had some internal confusion on how to deal with an intermittent wheel well fire warning. They decided to divert as a precaution.

All of the sudden we got an ECAM that the autothrottles turned OFF and we got an ECAM that the autothrottles were in thrust lock.  Then the Number 1 engine suddenly rolled back to idle thrust while the Number 2 engine remained at normal thrust.  We declared an emergency letting ATC know we were experiencing and engine failure and we would get back to them.  Within one minute later, we were able to regain normal control of the Number 1 engine, but not the autothrust.  We rescinded the emergency with ATC and continued the flight to ZZZ1 without the autothrust.  The rest of the flight was uneventful.				An A320's autothrottle transitioned to THRUST LOCK followed by the number one engine spooling back.  The crew declared an emergency, but the engine returned to normal operation with no autothrottles.

Subsequently, the number 1 engine retarded uncommandedly to idle. Unsure, of the exact problem, and not sure if we could hold altitude while we troubleshot the problem, we declared an emergency with Center and advised them to standby. As the pilot flying, I disconnected the autopilot, retarded both throttles to idle, and we assessed both engine indications. We ensured that the Auto Thrust system was disengaged and slowly advanced each engine throttle. No other abnormalities were encountered and both engines appeared to be operating normally. We felt the situation was safe so I rescinded the emergency declaration. During the event, there were no altitude or route deviations. Subsequently, we made a safe, hand flown approach under VMC conditions.				An A320 flight crew experienced failed autothrust capability and, after analysing their capabilities and the weather, continued utilizing continued to their destination using manual flight and thrust controls.

On both MCDUs the FMC prompt was missing, and we were unable to interact with either FMC. Along with this the MCDU message 'FMC1 Failure' or something like that was displayed. Interestingly, 'FMC2 Failure' was never displayed, and the original course was visible on the First Officer's navigation display, but we had no way to interact with the course. Of course we ran the QRH checklist, but there is not much help for this situation.I notified ATC that we had lost our area navigation capability and needed a vector to pick up an airway. Much radio time and brain cycles were spent trying to collaboratively figure out with ATC if we were still legal to stay in RVSM airspace, and if we were, what was our slant suffix for the flight plan. These issues took valuable mind space while we were trying to fix more immediate concerns, such as what was wrong with the airplane and would something else fail shortly. We were cleared direct MCN but it seemed to be offline as neither of our VOR receivers could receive it. We continued on vectors and I tuned other VORs nearby, and they came in fine. Later on in the flight we were cleared direct to HNN but were once again unable to receive its signal. The next fix, JPU, a low class VOR on the arrival was coming in fine, and we were cleared direct. Yet another problem occurred, as the next VOR was, again, indicating no course although the DME function seemed to be operational. Our destination was VFR, and we performed an uneventful visual approach to Runway 28L although the ILS the glideslope was NOTAMed out of service. Fortunately we didn't have to do the 'dive-and-drive'.My concerns are multiple. First, the possibility of a dual FMC failure is supposed to be almost nil. What happened to cause BOTH FMCs to go out on us? If number 1 fails, number2 should be completely separate so as to have backup. There is, in actuality, zero redundancy if the failure of number 1 can propagate to number 2. My second concern is that if we happen to have this situation happen on a WATRS route, we are basically a blind airplane. The INS coordinates were still displayed on the overhead unit, but trying to navigate with that to any kind of accuracy standard would be impossible. Basically, we would have to declare an emergency if this happens in WATRS airspace, and I'd like some kind of language added to the WATRS training program to address the fact that if you lose both FMCs in WATRS airspace you are required to immediately declare an emergency. I don't honestly remember if that was covered already in our training syllabus, but if it wasn't, it should be. My third concern is that the reliability of the nation's VORs seems to have significantly degraded. To have three VORs unusable but not NOTAMed out of service (ATC acted like they were surprised that they all were non-functional) is pretty poor reliability, and if we're heading down the road to getting rid of the VOR system, we're going to need a more reliable backup. Dual FMC failures obviously do occur, no matter what the odds are against it happening. If this situation would have been coupled with a communications failure, now that airplane is truly on its own, without navigation or radar vectors.My final concern is that after we landed, I called maintenance and they deferred both FMCs, authorizing continued service! Now I understand that is perfectly legal according to our MEL. But it is nevertheless very stupid. Pilots who may not have flown airways in a decade are simply not safe to fly them without expecting some kind of accidental deviation. There you have it - this should not be allowed in my opinion. I did my best to find the next Captain who was taking the airplane on, and I finally did see him as we were arriving at the hotel and he was heading to the airport. I told him the situation, and that he hadno FMCs - he'd be doing old-school navigation. He laughed at this with bravado. I'd love to see the radar track of that flight, is all I'm saying.				A B737-700 Captain discussed the problems he encountered upon losing both FMCs in RVSM airspace and subsequently finding several of the VORs by which they attempted to navigate an airways clearance were out of service although not NOTAMed to be so.

The flap indicator stayed in the up position with the needles slightly (almost not noticeably) split. We discontinued the approach and were assigned runway heading with an altitude. I instructed the First Officer to declare an emergency and to tell ATC we need to work on the problem. They gave us vectors and told us to let them know when we would be ready to land. I asked for the longest runway. We isolated the problem via the QRH. The procedures for flap malfunctions are extensive and complicated. My First Officer was very thorough and meticulous with the checklist. We had the fuel and time to go through the list twice. I was convinced and confident that we did all we could do and it was now time to commence the approach. I landed ref 140+40 uneventfully and taxied to the gate. The training we get could not have come into play more. The procedures worked as we have trained for. Please pass on to Training to keep flight control problems in the syllabus.

When we searched the EFB, we chose exactly that. Runway 18C JTEEE1.ALDAY. The EFB also had a JTEEE1 RNAV page as well but that didn't match our PDC. When we loaded the departure in the FMC, it had 3 or 4 other waypoints listed which in retrospect were the fixes on the JTEEE1 RNAV SID. Since none of these were on the EFB SID, nor were they in the PDC, we deleted them. On the runway, Tower cleared us [direct] to what sounded like JTEEE. My IOE First Officer read back, 'confirm that was direct to JTEEE?' ATC replied, 'yes.' On climb out we engaged LNAV and headed for JTEEE. Departure said we were cleared to CHETO [one of the deleted waypoints], and I replied 'negative, we confirmed JTEEE.' No other traffic in the area except for a landing to 18L after us.These new departure SIDS need to be listed with transitions. There should be no guessing with a route change as to which one we should fly. It should be exact. Also, there should be a published document in all trip folders that show how each of these departures are pronounced. I heard JTEEE after confirmation with ATC, and ATC claims they said CHETO. All four of us on the jet--which included another 777 Check Airman as second Relief Pilot--heard the same thing. In the digital aero charts FIV [Flight Information Viewer], there is only one departure for the JTEEE1. Why are there 2 in the EFB then and how was I supposed to know which one was correct? We clearly thought--as we do now--that we were correct.				B777-200 flight crew experienced a track heading deviation immediately after takeoff while on the JTEEE1 RNAV SID off Runway 18C at MEM.

We were previously cleared for descent via to 7R transition. At some point the runway was changed. We were sent to a new Controller and were asked if we had the new ATIS code. The pilot not flying said we had, even though we had not. This new ATIS included a runway change and the Controller then cleared us for the 25 arrival. Had we fessed up to not having the ATIS, the communication might have gone smoother. In any event, I noticed we now had the wrong transition in the box and had just a few miles to fix it. What made things more complex now was the fact that we were passing GEELA on the right ground track to 25, but now well below the next fix MNSTR, which is a 15,000-16,000 FT restriction. This became obvious when the jet wouldn't take VNAV due to us being below the restriction. We got on the radio quickly and got the restriction changed to MNSTR at 11,000 FT. No altitude deviation, but it took some luck and quick radios to fix it in time. The rest of the arrival was uneventful. We did not help matters by agreeing to an ATIS code we did not have. Perhaps the new clearance for us may have gone a bit smoother if the Controller had that info. I would like to focus on a larger point. That is, any time there is a new runway given, I would like to see the Controllers give us a heading and altitude to get us on our way first. This would allow us to make our FMC changes and not bust an altitude or go in a bad direction as we try to quickly get the box right. At this point both, pilots are heads down and pretty focused on the box and the points. Any typing error here due to rushing this process can be bad news. Instead, a clearance like 'you are now cleared to Runway 25 via 090 heading and 11 thousand. Advise when you are direct MNSTR and ready to resume the Runway 25R transition.' I am not locked into this phrase exactly, but I think a heading and altitude and some feedback from the pilots gives us time to make sure the box is right and will eliminate other radio calls due to typing or altitude errors. Had we not been able to get our request on the radio in time, we would have crossed MNSTR well below the charted altitude. This same scenario plays out multiple times a day on the LAX arrivals. Some Controllers do a great job and give you a heading to the localizer and an altitude. That is easy to do as you are flipping charts and trying to get the box right. Others ask you to get on the new transition to a new point which may be just a couple of miles on your nose. The last minute change is all on the pilot to get it right. I think that is a mistake. This type of change should first be given a simple clearance and then a descent via or any other complex clearance, once we have our act together. My hope here is ATC will see how dynamic these situations are, and come up with a standard way of handling them for the benefit of everybody.		While descending via the approach for 7R, ATC told us to descend via approach for 25L just prior to the branch point. We scrambled to update the FMC and realized we were already below the proper altitude for the 25L transition. We asked Approach what altitude they wanted us at. They assigned us a hard altitude of 10,000 FT. They left us hanging while we clarified assigned altitude. We felt that [ATC] should have clarified assigned altitude when changing runway and given us a heading to fly when changing runway just prior to branch point.		B737-700 flight crew reports being assigned a runway change from 7R to 25L approaching GEELA on the GEELA6 arrival to PHX. This results in quick changes to the FMC to stay on track but being below the MNSTR crossing restriction with no altitude assignment from ATC.

We thoroughly briefed the noise abatement takeoff procedures from SNA. All operations and procedures occurred normally through the completion of the Before Takeoff Checklist. The aircraft was configured correctly for the special procedures; flaps were at 10 degrees, N1's in manual and set at 75.8%. THR RED set at 3,000 FT AGL, flight directors ON, LNAV armed, autothrottles armed, with the departure SID (CHANL 1) loaded in the FMC with the takeoff Runway 19R. After being cleared for takeoff by the Tower, the Captain pushed the power up and let the N1's stabilize at 40%, then released the brakes and pressed the TO/GA button. The throttles successfully advanced to the MAX power setting, the flight mode annunciator (FMA) said TO/GA, and the command bars came up on the PFD/ND. At sometime during the takeoff roll, the command bars dropped out of view from the PFD/ND. I noticed during the takeoff rotation that we no longer had command bars, and the TO/GA mode had dropped out from the FMA. The white LNAV armed had also dropped out from the FMA. The Captain continued to fly using pre-briefed pitch attitude. As the pilot not flying, I re-engaged LNAV at 400 FT AGL, announced 'approaching cutback' at 600 FT AGL, and performed the throttle cutback noise abatement at 800 FT AGL. The Tower then told us to contact Departure at 1,000 FT MSL. However, with no vertical mode engaged (TO/GA had dropped out), the command bars would not come back up. At one mile, we turned left to heading 175 with the help of the map display and the LOC DME. I didn't want to re-engage a vertical mode by hitting the TOGA button. I was afraid this would override THR HOLD and cause the power to go to go-around setting and trigger a noise sensor on the departure corridor. I decided to select LVL CHG and verified the throttles remained in THR HOLD with the current cutback power setting. We also encountered minor wake turbulence at 2,000 FT with the power still at cutback setting. An Airbus A320 had taken off approximately two minutes prior to our departure. We successfully flew and navigated the remainder of the CHANL 1 Departure, including the cleanup and power-up procedures at 3,000 FT. After climbing through 10,000 FT and completion of the Climb Checklist, the Captain and I discussed the whole incident. We verified that we had all the buttons and switches in the correct positions and modes for the prescribed SNA close-in noise abatement procedure. We still cannot understand why the TO/GA and LNAV modes dropped out during the takeoff roll. Again the autothrottles successfully set MAX N1's. We flew the CHANL 1 Departure and the noise abatement procedure correctly. However, in an already high task saturation environment, the minor mode malfunctions increased our already high workload significantly. I do not know what we could have done differently. However the new procedures that require us to execute the cutback procedure even earlier during the climbout (800 FT AGL) are even more unsafe and create higher cockpit task saturation than the old cutback (1,000 FT AGL) procedure. We have to prioritize noise considerations with navigation/automation malfunctions. In the big picture, this whole close-in noise abatement procedure at SNA creates a potential safety hazard, and when a minor navigation/automation malfunction occurs, it multiplies the already high cockpit workload. In the interest of safety, we need to examine the necessity of this arcane procedure that exists purely for the benefit of questionable noise issues in the local Orange County area.				B737-700 First Officer reports auto flight anomalies during a noise abatement departure from SNA. The procedure is successfully flown manually but the crew does not understand what caused the flight director bars to retract from view, auto thrust to disengage, and LNAV to be no longer armed.

We decided to divert to ZZZ, as it was the closest major airport and were still uncertain as to the entire nature of the problem. Flight attendants and passengers were notified and updated, time permitting, throughout the emergency. The Captain accomplished the approach and landing.

For example: for today's takeoff from Munich Runway 26R, the old system (FMS provided) would have been V1, VR and V2 speeds of 151, 154 and 158 KTS. The sys provided speeds are 164, 166 and 169 KTS. Thus, with the old system, you continue the takeoff with speed once at or above 151 KTS but, with the new system, you continue the takeoff with speed at or above 164 KTS. Thus, B777 pilots may ABORT their takeoff at HIGHER speeds (164 KTS vs 151 KTS) with this new system; which is closer to the Vmbe [Maximum Brake Energy] speed as well as closer to the far end of the runway. However, sufficient runway remains to successfully abort. Conclusion - Our Carrier prefers to have the aircraft ON THE GROUND. Since all the Emergency Vehicles are on the GROUND, that makes sense. With the imprecisely defined wet runway data, the crew is directed to CONTINUE the takeoff when V1 is the equivalent of Vmcg [Minimum Control speed Ground]. This is reportedly due to controllability concerns with an engine loss. Conclusion - our Carrier prefers that an aircraft be AIRBORNE, committing to taking off at the LOWEST possible V1 speed IF there is a chance of a slippery runway. However, an ABORT would be highly desirable for any number of serious mechanical problems, even with an engine loss. Even an engine FIRE does not necessarily mean a loss of thrust on the engine. In any emergency near Vmcg, reducing the thrust to idle eliminates directional control concerns anyway if they were to exist at all. That is why the Captain's hand is ON the THROTTLES until committed to taking off. Under normal conditions, the new system produces a HIGHER V1 speed while the ill-defined wet runway rule produces a LESS SAFE operation with a MINIMUM V1 speed. The risk exposure is indefensible. The wet runway procedure eliminates, actually prohibits, an ABORT at the speeds just above Vmcg. Instead, an extended takeoff roll is required unnecessarily, with or without asymmetric thrust concerns. A takeoff can be in doubt for many reasons besides an engine loss. Continuing the takeoff requires any number of additional procedures related to the malfunction, as well as dumping fuel, navigating, conducting an approach in a degraded condition. The training center's analysis, defending their position, stated that it gave the pilot 'more time to practice' a long takeoff run with asymmetric thrust. Continuing the takeoff [for steering practice] is the equivalent of choosing the furthest exit in a burning building to get practice dodging falling debris. That does not justify this solution for a once in a lifetime emergency. The FAA's own Takeoff Safety pamphlet states a widebody crew could expect one of these events every 30 years. Our own airline has a much better batting average. The fact that the new program can assign a wide range of speeds for V1, from Vmcg to Vmbe, means that our own organization has set this illogical policy. If you cannot trust a crew to abort a takeoff just above Vmcg, why would you have confidence in them completing a series of far more difficult procedures and checklists which result in greater safety risks, greater fuel costs, and greater demands on maintenance? Changing the slippery runway low V1 speed policy should be closely examined by pilots other than the pilots who made that determination.				A B777 Captain believes his airline is improperly utilizing aircraft takeoff performance data particularly with respect to takeoffs from a slippery runway.

They said it smelled 'electrical'. We sent an 'on break' First Officer to that location who reported he could not smell or detect any odor. To our knowledge no one else could now smell the odor. No abnormality was witnessed or detected in the cabin. Passenger in that area had been noticed using lap tops and Bose headset equipment. No further odor was reported for the remainder of the flight.About 6+30 hours into the flight I went to the cabin myself during a break. I walked past row 14 twice plus saw and talked to numerous flight attendants. No odors were present and everyone seemed very content. Approximately 30 minutes later, while well into our descent, we were contacted again and told flight attendants were experiencing headaches and nausea but no odors were present in the cabin. I believe we were told they had been working the left side of the aisle in coach. We selected high flow for better ventilation. Shortly after that, one of the three flight attendants was feeling worse and felt the need to sit down and asked for oxygen. We again asked about odors but none were reported from any location in the cabin. We asked if the distressed flight attendant wanted to be met by paramedics. We were told she said yes and we made the request. We were told she was sitting up, conversing, and appeared normal but perhaps a little pale. Remote medical assistance was not contacted directly as only 30-45 minutes of flight remained. An emergency was not declared. We were allowed to keep speed up and ATC got us right in and paramedics were in position awaiting us. After gate arrival I got no updates regarding the three distressed flight attendants. Thinking someone would come up front or call; I became involved with maintenance, paper work and completed the cabin fume, odor, and smoke form for Maintenance. By the time my IOE Captain and I were able to move aft everyone had already left the aircraft.				Faint odors detected by passengers and flight attendants aboard an A330 may have caused nausea and headaches for three flight attendants as the flight approached its destination.

After checking weather, no delays were noted; weather was clear. After contacting Approach was advised to hold at KADDY Intersection, expect 25 minute in holding. I sent ACARS message to Dispatch notifying of hold. We had 35 minutes of hold fuel in release. I also notified Dispatch that I would burn down to arrive [with] 4,000 LBS fuel and if not released to [destination] by then would declare minimum fuel.After reaching our EFC, asked Approach how much longer. They stated at least 25 minutes. My First Officer and I discussed this and decided to declare minimum fuel. Approach stated 'sorry we can't help you', and that we should proceed to our alternate. I again sent a message to Dispatch asked about alternate airports. Dispatch stated that [a nearby airport] was approved for 757/767 only and that we may have to declare an emergency to get to [destination]. After several minutes my First Officer and I decided to declare emergency and proceed to [destination]. We notified Approach, [and] were given direct airport. Landed [and] taxied to gate. No further problems. VIP movement was supposed to be completed by an hour before, but this did not occur. Dispatch had hold fuel for delay; however additional holding was not expected. Approach did not honor minimum fuel request for priority handling. This forced us to declare an emergency.				A320 Captain reported minimum fuel to Approach while holding for VIP movement on destination airport. When that did not produce the desired result, he declared an emergency and landed at destination.

The climb out was normal. Autopilot ON and aircraft in NAV and proceeded on course to SXC from PEBLE. We passed SXC and noticed that the FMS made it a 'FLY BY WAYPOINT' because of the large turn it had to make to continue on C1177. This is a normal function of the Airbus FMS. We were about FL250 or higher and at normal climb speed of about 310 KIAS. ATC calls and tells us that we had flown into the warning area W-291 by about 2 or so miles. He also said that he has noticed this happening with Airbus type aircraft. We responded that the FMS does this 'FLY BY WAYPOINT' and that we have no idea that it is encroaching into the warning area. I relayed to him that I would let the company know about this problem and that we should make it an 'OVERFLY WAYPOINT'. He said he would follow up and let our company know about the problem. Why this event occurred in my opinion is that the FMS tries to make a smooth turn in transition to course changes. This probably is the way that the FMS is programmed from Airbus and Honeywell. We need to make a change to either the FMS or make SXC an 'OVERFLY WAYPOINT'. Maybe the chart maker should be notified also.				A330 Captain, departing on the PEBLE3 from SAN, is informed that the large radius turn initiated approaching SXC to intercept C1177 outbound has resulted in an incursion into W-291.

It was night, VFR. Our clearance was to proceed direct to CALLS and descend to 6,000 FT. As we descended, we got and maintained visual contact with Runway 11L. I checked the minimum altitude for CALLS, which was 5,000 FT and confirmed that altitude with the First Officer. While I knew the high terrain was just to the west of centerline, I did not verify the altitude of the terrain, which was 4,600 FT. As we approached the terrain, I continued to crosscheck the terrain display on my instruments. The First Officer backed it up as well.Soon after we passed through 6,000, we got a 'Caution Terrain' warning. As I was reaching to take control of the aircraft, the caution changed to a GPWS 'Pull Up Terrain' command. The First Officer stated we have to perform a terrain avoidance maneuver as I was switching off the automation. I added power and was approaching a 20 degree deck angle when we passed through 5,700 FT and the Terrain Warning terminated. I leveled the plane, captured ILS glide path prior to CALLS, and completed the approach and landing. At no time did we lose sight of the runway.I should have taken the time to review the elevation of that terrain before the approach. Definitely don't descend below 6,000 FT until past that hill.		On a visual approach to 11L in TUS, we received a 'Caution Terrain' followed by 'Pull Up Terrain' Warning at 5,500 FT MSL approximately 17 NM from the airport while following another aircraft.Next time approaching 11L from the northwest, I will tune the ILS at a point outside of CALLS to provide terrain clearance around CALLS.		On a night visual approach to Runway 11L at TUS the flight crew of a B737-700 received Caution Terrain and 'Pull Up Terrain' EGPWS warnings roughly 17 NM from the airport.  They complied with the terrain avoidance maneuver, tuned the ILS and intercepted the GS from below, then continued to landing.

During this ground interrupt the left engine was found to have lost the tail cone.  A search found the tail cone in the area just off the approach end of Runway XX.  There were no indications in the cockpit of an engine problem.				As takeoff thrust was set a B777's forward cargo door light illuminated, so the takeoff was rejected.  At the gate, no cargo door defect was found but the left engine tail cone was discovered missing.

We initially attributed it to a non-emergency issue we had during gear retraction when the nose gear failed to remain locked up in the retracted position. The QRH procedure remedied that situation, but required continuous pressure on the landing gear up system. Just prior to descent, we began to feel certain that the unusually low quantity was due to a leak instead of increased system demands as the volume continued to decrease. We assessed that we would be able to approach and land at our filed destination without using emergency procedures if our routing and sequencing was close to normal. During the descent, we were instructed to proceed to holding. We both quickly agreed that was not a safe option and stated to Approach we would be unable. They asked what our divert was and we stated it and were issued a clearance there, but we also quickly assessed that was also an unsafe alternative and stated we were unable to accept the clearance. The Captain requested priority handling for our destination and then declared the emergency when ATC denied the request. System 'A' fluid level was roughly 20-25% below a low normal and continuing to drop. I was timing the loss rate and had noticed an increase in the loss rate over time. We then flew direct to the approach and landed without incident using normal systems. Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighters (ARFF) at the end of the runway noted no apparent leaks. Our fluid levels had risen from 51% to 68% - still way below normal and we elected to taxi to the ramp with the ARFF Commander trailing us. At the gate, closer examination revealed hydraulic fluid escaping from and pooling in the main wheel wells and a significant leak in the 'A' system.				A B737-800 crew left the 'A' Hydraulic System pressurized to keep the nose gear in the uplocks during flight, but developed a hydraulic leak which required that an emergency be declared for landing.

We were able to program the last minute change and brief the approach, but time and workload were at a premium at that point, and getting the aircraft back into path was a struggle, we were high and fast. This put us into a full speed brake situation with speed intervention in order to meet the next speed restriction. Next, ATC issued a slow down during this maneuver (250 KTS) which boxed us in even more. Around 10,000, ATC issued a runway change from 34L to 34C. The Captain re-programmed the approach and set me up for 34C, but during this, the FMC caused a reversion to CWS and CWP and I lost any kind of LNAV/VNAV info for a brief period. Automation was soon restored and we continued uneventfully, probably because ATC reverted us to a vector clearance. This practice of issuing speed restrictions and not giving us lower soon enough really messed up our automation and caused too much distraction in my opinion. This could have easily led to a deviation. If we are going to fly RNAV arrivals, we need to be able to fly them as published when they are built to such close tolerance as these new SEA arrivals. We completely negated any kind of fuel savings with all of the speed and altitude changes (lack there of) during the procedure. I think declining these arrivals is the best procedure until everyone is on the same page.				Air Carrier inbound to SEA voiced concern regarding the issuance of speed restrictions on RNAV arrival procedures when ATC fails to issue lower altitudes compatible with FMS capabilities.

I was advised by FOQA that, during approach to ORD, flaps were at 15 and a 'momentary' exceedance to 207 KTS occurred. After this 'momentary' exceedance, speed went back below the maximum flaps 15 speed. The event happened at approximately 4,500 FT. and on glide slope as described to me by the person in FOQA. The following is a description of the event to the best of my recollection, but I can only surmise why the speed momentarily exceeded the limit because I did not see any speed exceedance, nor were there any systems indications, such as warning horns or status messages to tell me a limit had been exceeded. We were initially assigned a speed on the arrival into ORD with a subsequent clearance for approach to 22R. It was the First Officer's leg and he was flying the airplane. At between 6,000 and 5,000 FT on descent, we got into moderate turbulence with some indication of wake turbulence. I asked the Approach Controller what we were following and he told us it was an Airbus. We continued in this turbulence as the First Officer subsequently called for flaps in normal increments with the appropriate verbiage calling out the speed first then the flaps setting. I do remember visually and audibly verifying that the speed at the time of each flaps extension was indeed below the maximum speed for that selection. At some point (I do not remember exactly when), I suggested to the First Officer that he turn off the autopilot and fly about one-half dot high on the glide slope to see if the turbulence would decrease. He stated he was about to do that and turned the autopilot off.We continued on the approach and I completed the Before Landing checklist. As we descended closer to the ground the turbulence decreased and the First Officer did an excellent job of landing the aircraft well within parameters. At no time was a stabilized approach jeopardized. The point at which the FOQA personnel told me the event happened indicates to me that the speed excursion happened while we were in this turbulence and I was completing the Before Landing checklist and possibly heads-down looking at the mechanical checklist or some other item in coordination with the checklist and by the time I looked back at the instruments, the momentary exceedance had already come and gone. Had I seen the exceedance, I certainly would have placed a numbered write-up in the logbook to indicate as such. This event certainly wasn't purposeful nor would I take an aircraft or give an aircraft to someone else knowing a limit had been exceeded.A contributing factor in this case is that I am relatively new in the airplane with between 100 and 200 hours and I am still getting used to the flying characteristics of the airplane, especially when it comes to descents and configurations. I will certainly be more vigilant in the future in regards to speed fluctuations with flaps extended and I will also reduce speed further before selecting flaps making the difference between the limit speed and actual speed larger, so there is more tolerance to speed fluctuations. The aircraft systems should also have indicated, either by an aural or status message, that this limit was exceeded. If it had been, the aircraft would not have flown again without obtaining the necessary inspection before its subsequent flight.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information]	Reporter stated aircraft type was B737-800.	A B737-800 flight crew had a momentary flap overspeed when they encountered wake turbulence in trail of an Airbus on approach to ORD.

After consultation with checklists, Dispatch, Maintenance Control, MEL (for reference only), and applicable landing data, the Captain elected to return to departure airport, declare an in flight emergency and land overweight.		Departed for overseas [on schedule] and approximately one hour into flight, while on my scheduled break, I was notified by a Flight Attendant to return to the cockpit at the Captain's request. The Captain briefed the other Relief Pilot and me that the left main fuel quality indicator quit displaying. He and the First Officer consulted the QRH and found no procedure for this. We also consulted the QRH and concurred with this. The Captain then contacted Dispatch and had a conference call with Maintenance Control. It was decided by all involved that we did not meet the MEL requirements, did not meet the fuel requirements, and could not meet the ETOPS requirements as dispatched for this flight to continue overseas. The decision was made to return. The Captain briefed the flight attendants that they did not have to brief for an emergency landing, and advised the passengers of the situation and our intentions. The Captain discussed with Dispatch the decision to dump fuel or land overweight. As the fuel quantity was unknown, the Captain decided the safest course of action would be to land overweight. There were no other system problems that were affecting the performance of the aircraft. An emergency was declared because of the overweight landing. All performance charts were reviewed, aircraft landed with a minimum rate of descent landing. CFR imaged the brakes for excessive heat, with none noted and then the Captain taxied the aircraft to the gate.		B777 Relief Pilots are informed one hour into flight by the operating crew that they have lost fuel quantity indication in the left main tank and are returning to the departure airport. An uneventful overweight landing ensues.

Autothrottles armed, we commanded a climb to assigned altitude. At about 7,000 FT MSL, we both noticed a #2 engine N1 overspeed, flashing red dial and associated left yaw. First Officer (pilot flying) immediately retarded thrust levers to mid range level and maintained control of the aircraft. It appeared the number 2 engine rolled back due to the overspeed, but when the thrust levers were retarded, the #2 engine appeared to have auto relit. Both engines were now operating normally in the mid power ranges. We coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance about the occurrence and elected to divert. We did not declare an emergency. Approach and landing were uneventful. I had contacted the flight attendants as we were turning to a divert airport to keep them informed. I asked them if they noticed anything unusual, and they did not feel the yawing moment, only felt the aircraft was flying a little slower than normal. Made a PA and told the passengers that everything was fine, but we were making a precautionary landing just to be safe. On a side note: The previous flight on descent, we got a Master Caution light and an OVHD warning for about five seconds. We never did see anything abnormal on the overhead panel. The light went out and the remainder of the approach/landing was uneventful. In hindsight, I suspect it was an EEC on the verge of failing and it materialized on the next flight. Dispatch/Maintenance/ATC all worked seamlessly for us.		Was climbing out of 5,000 FT to FL190, selected Level Change at 5,000 FT with autothrottles engaged and pushed throttles up slightly to reduce time for engines to reach climb thrust. Shortly after the aircraft yawed to the right and overspeed warning light on, engine instrument panel alerted. Pulled the throttles back, engine #2 recovered. [We] diverted as a precaution. No emergency declared.		B737-700 flight crew experienced an over speeding engine during climbout. The thrust levers are retarded and the engine returns to normal operation but the crew elects to divert to a suitable alternate.

(System 'A' Engine Driven Hydraulic Low Pressure light on, hydraulic light on system annunciator panel, and master caution light.) Ran checklist for event. Also, thoroughly reviewed and discussed total System 'A' failure just in case. While at cruise at FL370, we got the above indications, which were preceded by rapid drop in System 'A' quantity to about 18%. Ran checklist, talked to Dispatch, and requested that ATC notify [divert destination] to have emergency crews standing by just in case the malfunction evolved into a full System 'A' failure.Initially Dispatch told us to proceed to [diversion airport option 1] then about 15 minutes later Dispatch instructed us to divert to [diversion airport option 2]. We discussed other possibilities should the emergency continue to get worse - it didn't. Got vectors, configured a little early and normally, which was uneventful. Landing was uneventful. Taxied back to gate but Captain noticed that when finer steering inputs were required that the aircraft was sluggish. Decided to stop aircraft and be towed to the gate. The System 'A' hydraulic system had three previous writeups of hydraulics needing service and aircraft notations that hydraulic quantity dropping quickly. Maintenance did do an engine run and had us cycle flight controls. No leak detected. Not sure what more could have been done.				B737-700 First Officer reported failure of Engine Driven Hydraulic System A. They declared an emergency and diverted to a suitable nearby airport for a safe landing.

The aircraft seemed to be losing A hydraulic fluid but no leaks had been detected. We monitored hydraulic level closely on the flight. Small loss was noted. When we landed, I walked around the aircraft and again no leaks were detected. We departed, and during cruise, we noticed A hydraulic level decreasing at a steady rate, approximately 10% per hour. We sent a request for Maintenance and Maintenance serviced hydraulics, reviewed previous write-ups, and called Maintenance Control. We then performed checks of all primary flight controls while mechanics watched for leaks and none were found. We then decided to run the engines and check there and once again none were detected. My First Officer and I were observing the quantity on climbout and it appeared to be holding. During an intermediate level off, we noticed the A hydraulic level decreasing at an increasing rate. Within a few seconds, we received a Master Caution flashing and saw that A Engine Driven Pump Low Pressure light was starting to flicker. Without consulting the QRH, I shut off the pump and I did not inform my First Officer why I was doing it and then reached over and turned off the A autopilot and switched it to his side, (B autopilot). Again I failed to tell him what I was doing and why. He was surprised by my actions and 'firmly' asked me what I was doing and I told him that I was trying to stop the complete loss of A system hydraulics and suspected that we would be losing A autopilot and was trying to avoid another distraction.The situation happened very quickly and I reacted out of instinct. In retrospect I feel that I was wrong for not keeping him informed of my thoughts and actions. That small interruption of procedures seemed to cause a brief breakdown of crew coordination. We resolved the issue quickly and then referred to the QRH. The remaining quantity was approximately 17% and we did not get a low pressure light from the engine driven pump and we were holding A system pressure. We notified Dispatch and established a patch with Maintenance Control. It appeared that I may not have adequately explained the situation to maintenance because they felt we were dealing with an A system failure. We were not. We still had A system pressure and the quantity was holding steady at 17%. After a few more minutes of explaining the situation, they understood what failures we were dealing with and the initial thought from Maintenance and Dispatch was for us to continue. Twice I reconfirmed their desire for us to continue. My First Officer and I did not feel that we had an emergency, but we knew that the aircraft would need significant maintenance and our destination seemed the likely place for us to land. Several minutes later, Dispatch informed us that it was decided that we should divert. We had already informed ATC that we had a problem but did not declare an emergency. All flight controls were operational at that time but my First Officer and I were already discussing the possibility that we may lose pressure when flaps and gear were extended for landing so we spent the extra time reviewing the QRH for A System Failure. We read it aloud to one another several times. A long final was requested in case the gear did not extend normally and we had to revert to manual extension. The gear extended very slowly and we had a momentary loss of pressure but it stabilized. During taxi into the ramp area, the nose wheel steering seemed sluggish so we shut down and were towed into the gate. The crew and passengers were kept informed during the entire event. Maintenance had me come down to the ramp to look at the damage to the pump. They felt that the pump was actually burning hydraulic fluid internally which led to its complete failure.First of all I commend the mechanics for being so diligent in looking for a possible problem. I don't know how often this type of failure occurs, but if it is not uncommon, then it may be prudent to take an aircraft out of service and the pumps checked if there has been a history of hydraulic servicing with no apparent leaks. My First Officer and I were confident that we were taking an airworthy aircraft. We knew there was a leak but never considered that it could lead to a complete failure. I think both of us will reconsider the situation if we are ever faced with it again. During approach I became aware of the fact that my First Officer and I had stopped communicating as effectively as we had been and we were concentrating on two separate issues. I feel that if I had continued to verbalize my thoughts to him then he would have realized that I may not have been concentrating on the same thing that he was. I was concerned with the possibility of having to go around and entering into a low fuel situation and he was concerned with getting configured very early. Once I told him of my concerns with fuel and an early configuration, we started communicating much more effectively. I do feel that I may have over tasked my First Officer a few times while we were working the problem. While I was talking with Dispatch and Maintenance, he was left flying single pilot and was also trying to review the QRH and answer the Flight Attendant's questions. Before making contact with Dispatch, we had arrived at a list of things we needed to do and I should have suggested that he hold off with those things until I could participate with him uninterrupted. What I did realize is that my First Officer's experience/knowledge of the aircraft and his willingness to question my thoughts and actions led to both of us coming up with a lot of other options that we individually had not seen. Apparently ATC had declared an emergency on our behalf. My First Officer and I had discussed the need to declare an emergency and we concluded that it was not necessary. In retrospect I think that by ATC declaring on our behalf it actually helped us as a crew by decreasing our workload. Their interaction helped keep us from fixating and increased our situational awareness throughout the remainder of the flight.				B737-700 Captain experiences a loss of A hydraulic system quantity and pressure in cruise and turns off the A system engine driven pump without consulting the QRH or informing the First Officer. Maintenance directs the crew to divert to a suitable airport where they are able to land normally with the A system pressurized although the nose wheel steering fails during taxi in.

No bird strike was suspected. The shattering centered in the window's top 11 o'clock position and 'spider webbed' thru the entire window with several cracks. ATC was notified that we were stopping the climb and the aircraft was leveled off between 16,000 and 17,000 FT. The check list for window damage was used. ATC was notified of the problem and a lower altitude and vectors to [departure airport] were requested. When considering the structural integrity of the window may be compromised, an emergency was declared with ATC. Maintenance and Operations were notified of the return. The flight attendants and passengers were notified. Dispatch acknowledged the return with an ACARS message. An overweight landing of 136,800 LBS was made and noted in the logbook write up. The window damage appears to be from stress as no bird strike was suspected.				B737-700 Captain reported failure of Captain's L1 window in climb. An emergency was declared and the flight returned to departure airport.

When aircraft arrived at gate, Inbound Captain debriefed us that on both the flight to and the return, they suffered the same problem and tried to control temperature by turning off hot air. This did not work and they went to APU for air conditioning and it seemed to work. Also had REV deployed ECAM in flight on the leg to IAH. The local mechanics had never performed the required reverser test and had difficulty getting through the procedure. Eventually, they found someone who had a little experience with that procedure and he came to assist. While mechanics were going through the test required for the reverser, I talked with Maintenance Control about the plan to defer the hot air to address the excessive cockpit temperature problem. Maintenance Controller said the previous crew did not give the hot air off a chance to correct problem. Since this was different than my understanding from my conversation with the crew, I gave the [Maintenance] Controller the benefit of the doubt and accepted the aircraft with the deferral. I asked what we could do if it recurred and he brought the Environmental Control System (ECS) report to my attention and provided the Flight Manual (FM) reference for this additional procedure. He explained that they had difficulty troubleshooting this kind of problem and having a print out of exactly where all the valves were positioned during an event would help. We departed and when we were only a few hundred feet in the air, a rush of hot air flooded the cockpit that was as severe a change as walking into a sauna. Unfortunately, the cabin temperatures also ran very hot this time - that had not been reported as occurring during the previous events. If we were not able to control the dramatic and severe rise of temperature, we would be forced to return to the field. I attempted to control the swing by turning down all three temp zone controllers and grabbed for the FM for the ECS procedure. I believe I was able to capture the event with this first report. With much attention and changes, the cabin temperatures stayed about 74 degrees for a while at cruise. However, after a short period of time, we watched the zone duct temperatures in the fwd and aft cabin shoot up to 90 plus degrees. I attempted small changes to catch the up swing with little effect. Only large knob turns seemed to affect the zone temps. A Flight Attendant called and alerted that a passenger in row 10 was put on O2 and believed it was a result of the stuffiness of the cabin. Also, she said the gaspers were not putting out cold air (later said it was just row 10). Throughout the flight, I provided engineering reports and corresponded with Maintenance Control about the problems. Also, we used the ECS report two more times and noted the circumstances on each print out. During descent into our destination, the aircraft got suddenly very humid and the zone and cabin temperatures again began to rise without any input to the controllers. I moved the forward and aft cabin temperature controllers full cold with little effect. Then, when I selected full cold on the cockpit temperature controller, the forward and aft cabin zone temperatures dropped dramatically. I discussed all our experiences with the outbound crew and the local mechanics upon arrival. I am now concerned about my decision to accept the airplane with a deferral that I felt was wrong because the result was a very work intensive flight that dis-serviced our passengers with a very uncomfortable flight.				A320 Captain believes that he erred in accepting an aircraft with ECS (Environmental Control System) anomalies. The cabin temperature cannot be controlled and much of the time is excessively hot.

ATC responded that we were preceded by a B757. After passing NOFIV and clearance to a lower altitude I asked the pilot flying to shallow the descent to avoid further wake encounter. Once the B757 turned base we were able to keep traffic in sight and in our base turn with a speed assignment of 170 KTS, we were asked to follow the B757 to the airport but maintain present heading and plan a turn to join final. ATC provided heading to join final and cleared us for a visual approach call the Tower at AJAAY. At this point we continued to slow and configure due to being above glide slope. Before reaching AJAAY, Approach asked our speed and instructed aircraft behind us to slow. I believe that ATC was planning for us to keep our 170 KTS until reaching the marker as stated in Safety Alert [bulletin]. Our clearance was cleared visual approach with no stated speed to the marker. Believe I may have become too conservative in my approach to wake avoidance. With traffic volume into ATL should have done a better job with ATC communication.				A B737-700 pilot reported deviating from ATC assigned speed to increase spacing behind a B757 that was causing some wake turbulence.

We were climbing out of [departure airport] and were accelerating through 250 KTS and 10,000 FT when the aircraft began a consistent, rhythmic shudder. It stopped around 12,500 FT for a short time and began again. We had no ECAM alerts or messages, just the airframe vibration. We decided to level at FL200 and slowed to 250 KTS and began trouble shooting by going through the system pages. We noticed that the right aileron indicator was vibrating at the same rate as the aircraft. We contacted the flight attendants for their input and were told that it could be felt throughout the airplane and passengers were showing signs of concern. We initiated contact with Dispatch and Maintenance through ACARS. The aircraft was always in control, but the vibration was quite uncomfortable. Because the shudder was nauseating, we made the decision to divert [to a nearby airport]. We did not declare an emergency as we were receiving priority handling and the aircraft was responding normally. We did a few normal turns in the descent to see if we could gather additional information for Maintenance, however, the vibration continued to the ground. I exercised emergency authority to execute an overweight landing. The landing, roll out, and taxi in were all normal. Upon deplaning, a couple of passengers mentioned that they could see the aileron 'fluttering in the wind', but didn't want to alarm other passengers by saying anything. We were able to pass this information on to Maintenance.				A320 Captain reported abnormal aileron vibration severe enough they decided to divert to nearest suitable airport.

Earlier in the descent, the Captain and I were (ironically enough) talking about VNAV and altitude restrictions and the programming and proper use of the FMC, VNAV etc. A few miles from HALIE, ATC asked us in a sarcastic tone of voice: 'Do you remember that crossing restriction at HALIE!?' I looked at the FMA and we were in VNAV PATH. I looked at the Descent page on my FMC/CDU and saw HALIE at 6,000 FT. I looked at the MCP and saw 6,000. I looked at the Cruise page and saw 10,000 FT. I cannot explain why the jet did not initiate a descent earlier and on proper descent profile.I disengaged the autothrottles (I believe) and deployed the speedbrakes, and at the same time, both the Captain and I knew we would not make HALIE at 6,000, so I told the Captain to ask for relief. He then asked Approach for a turn, apologized, and Approach quickly gave us a vector and a descent to 4,000. The remainder of the approach and landing was uneventful. What bothers me so much is that we verified the programming, verbalized the callouts, and monitored until we were distracted with our own discussion of VNAV crossing restrictions. All the while this jet was not about to make the restriction even though, I believe, all programming and VNAV functions were done correctly. I'll be the first to admit my mistakes, but I need to know what they were so I (and others) can learn from this! If the jet was not going to make HALIE at 6,000 why did it stay in VNAV PATH and not switch to VNAV SPD like we see a lot of times when we are not going to make the next restriction and further action is required? This is what puzzles me so much!I realize and understand we need to monitor the airplane, and as we get more automation and functionality, it is that much more important. However, it has always bothered me that when the jet drops out of VNAV PATH and switches to VNAV SPD, there needs to be more than just an FMA change; a light, an FMC annunciation, or something. For an action as critical as not making an altitude restriction, we need a better warning system in place for the jet to tell us that it is not going to make an altitude restriction unless action is taken.				Although they believe they programmed the FMS properly to comply with ATC's clearance to cross HALIE at 6,000 MSL the flight crew was surprised to find they had never left 10,000 MSL when ATC queried them about making the restriction. An acknowledged contributing factor was the flight crew's failure to monitor their flight path, anticipating that the FMS would do what they thought they had programmed.

We had selected LNAV before takeoff roll and 7,000 FT selected in altitude window. Clearance limit was FL190 with all the depicted altitude restrictions. Just leaving ROPPR at 7,000 FT (Altitude Hold), Departure told us to delete the ROPPR restriction (we'd already met) and the MDDOG restriction at 9,000 FT. We deleted the MDDOG altitude on the CDU and selected FL190 in the altitude window. We then selected VNAV and VNAV speed was on the scoreboard. The next fix, TARRK, was a magenta BOLD 11,000 FT. Neither one of us caught the aircraft climb through until about 11.4K, at which time ATC asked why we weren't complying with the TAARK restriction. We descended from approximately 11.6K to 11,000 FT. Both of us didn't understand why the aircraft did not level at 11,000 FT. Again, you can't monitor enough in dynamic flight. We could have selected 11K in the altitude window, but we felt we made no system errors. [Should have had] more intensive monitoring of NAV and autopilot systems during dynamic flight by both crew members.		Do not trust the autopilot to level off as commanded. Be careful to only put the most next restrictive altitude in the MCP.		A B737-700 autopilot failed to capture the SNEAD 7 11,000 FT TARRK constraint event though it was in the FMS with FL190 in the MCP.

Because I was a low-time in type pilot, the Captain did the takeoff since it was a special airport, but I became the pilot flying after completing the After Takeoff checklist. We had experienced a 7 hour delay on the ground because the aircraft arrived with a Left Bleed Trip Off write up. The inbound crew had the Left Bleed Trip Off several times, and Maintenance spent a long time troubleshooting. They replaced two parts one of which was the temperature sensor. After they completed an engine run and testing, we were given the aircraft to fly. The flight started uneventful. We noticed during climb out (don't recall altitude) there was a split in duct pressure. Right duct was about 37 PSI and the left duct was about 27 PSI. During our climb up to FL360, we experienced a Left Bleed Trip Off at FL330. We decided to level off at FL340. I flew the aircraft and had the radios and the Captain worked the Bleed Trip Off QRH. We pressed the trip reset per the QRH and the light extinguished. Both ducts pressures were approximately 33 PSI. After maybe 5 seconds, the left duct dropped to about 27 PSI again and then dropped to 22 PSI followed by a Left Bleed Trip Off again. We continued the QRH and turned off the Left Pack. We decided to continue to our filed destination. We were filed at FL380 and decided to stay at FL340 because we had the fuel and felt it would be better in case we needed to descend due to a pressurization problem. The ride was a bit bumpy so we climbed to FL360. A short while later, we climbed to FL380 to get on top of a little layer we could see that was painting mostly green on radar. It was dark out and difficult to determine if we would be able to avoid the layer. As we approached the weather, we flew into a little cloud layer. The temperature I think was -54 C and did not require engine anti-ice. We were almost through the green depicted area on the radar when Center gave us a descent from FL380-360. We were IMC and in a descent so we placed the engine anti-ice on. At this point I don't recall if the incident occurred during the descent or not but I believed we had leveled off at FL360 before the event occurred. I was briefing the arrival and approach because we were about 5 minutes from top of descent. Very shortly thereafter we experienced a Master Caution for air conditioning. I looked up and saw we now had a Right Bleed Trip Off as well. I looked at the cabin altitude indicator and saw the cabin was slowly (about 500 FPM) climbing. The Captain yelled out the memory items and we both donned our oxygen masks and tried to communicate. The seat belt sign was already on. I became distracted initially because the Captain was having difficulty establishing communications and trying to pull out the QRH which he appeared to be fumbling with. At the same time, the flight attendants were in the cabin and were trying to call through the interphone which neither one of us responded to. After my initial distraction, I called Center and stated we needed an emergency descent due to loss of pressurization. We were cleared to 11,000 FT and the Captain dialed 27,400 FT into the altitude window and then went back to trying to communicate with me and do the QRH at the same time. I could see the Captain was struggling with those two tasks so I clicked off the autopilot and autothrottle, pulled the throttles to idle and begin an immediate descent. I dialed in 11,000 in the altitude window and selected level change and ran the speed window up to the barber poll and descended near the barber poll. I missed getting the speedbrakes out and Captain pointed to them and I went to full in flight deployment of speedbrakes. The Captain was working through the QRH but it seemed to be taking a long time. Since we had just run the Bleed Trip Off checklist, I reached up (passing FL260) and pressed the trip reset button. The Right Bleed Trip Off remained illuminated but the Left Bleed Trip Off extinguished. I looked at the cabin altitude indicator and saw the cabin was beginning to descend. The Left Bleed Trip Off tripped again after maybe 30 seconds but it bought us a little more time to get down. The cabin warning horn sounded and I silenced the horn. The aircraft caught up with the cabin at approximately 14,500 FT. We continued the descent to 10,000 FT and at some point during the dive, the Captain declared an emergency with ATC and stated fuel and souls on board. The passenger masks were manually deployed per the QRH procedure. At 10,000 FT we took off our masks and I told the Captain to check on the flight attendants. I also asked for an early descent from ATC because we were unpressurized and I wanted to restrict the descent to 500 FT per minute. We proceeded to a fix on the ILS and landed uneventfully. After taxiing into the gate, the Captain entered the items in the maintenance logbook and we discussed the issue with the mechanics. I was through but the Captain was still scheduled for a delayed flight that night. I advised the Captain to call the Duty Manager and have himself assessed before continuing following our incident.		[Narrative 2 contained no additional information]		A B737-800 with an engine bleed air trip history was at FL330 when the Left Bleed tripped. To get over weather, they climbed to FL380 where there second bleed tripped, so an emergency was declared and the flight descended to 10,000 FT with crew and passenger oxygen in used.

When reviewing it, it show no position fuel reported to Dispatch by showing a dash next to the oceanic position instead of the A next to the position, even though we had passed over the position not abeam it. We were on a re-dispatch release, not a reserve release, so this was not a regulatory issue but in investigating we discovered the ACARS had dumped its initialization page which caused the aircraft not to report or accept ACARS messages. There is no notification to the pilot when/if this occurs other than troubleshooting when not receiving a response for an ACARS request or as I routinely do, look at the update to be sure Dispatch is receiving fuel reports. We had received all ETOPS required information, so the initialization dump had occurred after oceanic entry and after ETOPS weather was received. We did not write this up in aircraft log book as this has happened to me about 4 times in the last 3 weeks, and appears not to be an aircraft specific issue but more of a system systemic issue as it has occurred to me on different 777 aircraft. I sent messages to the Dispatcher telling him I was going to file a report and he indicated this has been an issue recently. The concerns I have is the flight following threat with Dispatch not able to contact the flight via SATCOM ACARS, also the security issues of immediate security messages sent through ACARS, and possible inability to receive ACARS clearances for oceanic entry. I encouraged the Dispatcher to file a report as well, to determine if this is a fleet specific issue to the 777 related to the AUTO INIT function of ACARS, dispatch software, or hardware issue with the flight following equipment.				A B777 Captain reported that at some point after oceanic track entry, the ACARS dropped its initialization which prevented the aircraft from sending and receiving ACARS reports including Dispatch messages, fuel reports, and other critical communications.

We all agreed for safety of flight to return and fix the problem.

The aircraft had a flap history in the logbook and the Captain and I had noted that prior to our departure. We also noted that it had a check flight as well. We tookoff with no problem and noted that the flaps were in the takeoff position on the flap gauge when we ran the checklist. We climbed to altitude without a problem. I did notice the flap indicator showed a slight split and did mention it to the Captain. Now inbound to our destination, and on the arrival, the runway we were planning on was changed. We got our charts out and loaded up the box for that approach and runway and the Captain briefed it. This happened in a fairly short amount of time. The Captain asked for flaps and landing gear down. I was focusing on the approach and stated we were looking a little high and not slowing. The Captain disconnected the autopilot and shallowed the descent and asked for more flaps when we got an aural warning of 'too low flaps'. The Captain immediately added power and we went around. I backed him up on the go-around and noticed on the flap gauge the flaps were up. There were many vectors. ATC finally started to give us longer straight line vectors. The many radio calls that we were getting, while trying to work through the QRH were distracting. I stated to ATC we were trying to get through a checklist and we were not ready for vectors for another approach at that time. We did get longer heading vectors so we could work through the QRH and work on the problem. The Captain elected to transfer control of the aircraft to me while he ran the QRH. We could not get the flaps to come down after running the QRH. We planned on a no flaps landing per the QRH and declared an emergency with ATC. We requested the longest runway. The Captain ran the performance calculations and referenced the QRH for our condition of a flaps up high speed landing. The Captain had notified the flight attendants and passengers of our condition and what our plan was. When the Captain was through talking with the Flight Attendants and did a PA to the passengers, he took back control of the aircraft. I stated to ATC that we were ready for the approach. ATC vectored and cleared us for the approach. We backed up the visual approach with the ILS and were cleared to land by Tower. We made the approach as briefed and the Captain landed without further incident. After exiting the runway and talking with Ground we made sure fire and rescue gave us the all clear to taxi to our gate and they said they would also follow us to the gate.		As we descended on the arrival and VNAV path, I noticed the aircraft speed had not slowed accordingly. I glanced at the flaps indicator and saw the flaps were still in the up position. Just as I was advancing the thrust levers to go around, we received the 'Too Low Flaps' aural annunciator.We informed ATC that we were going around and received vectors to leave the area for a chance to troubleshoot the situation. After completing our checklists and reviewing the procedures for a flaps up landing, we declared an emergency and received vectors for a visual approach. The emergency vehicles were in place. We landed uneventfully. After taxiing off the runway, the emergency personnel visually assessed the condition of the tires. Once on the ramp, we were towed to the gate.		B737-700 flight crew report accepting an aircraft that had a history of flap problems. On the first approach the flaps failed to extend when selected, but this is not detected by the crew until the EGPWS annunciates 'to low, flaps.' A go around is initiated, QRH procedures are complied with, an emergency is declared, and a flaps up landing ensues.

The Captain was in the restroom at this time. When he got back to the cockpit just a few minutes later the vibration indicator was above 8.0, it got up to a high of about 8.5. This was also accompanied by a noticeable airframe rumble or vibration, similar in nature to the vibration or rumble we hear in the Airbus when the landing lights are extended at the higher air speeds, like just before retracting the landing light passing 10,000 FT. I took the aircraft and radios and the Captain handled the checklist and radio/ACARS communication with Maintenance Control and Dispatch, etc. I heard some but not all of that interchange since I was flying and talking with ATC. Other than the vibration indications, all other engine indications were normal throughout the flight. As per the checklist, the throttle in question was pulled back to a setting where the vibration indication dropped below 5.0. On the initial reduction the vibration indication was reduced to about 1.5 or so and the airframe vibration/rumble stopped completely. We descended to about 26,000 FT; maintaining altitude and airspeed was not a problem, and the engine seemed to be operating normally. All indications were normal. While all this was in progress, I checked weather for several possible alternates. I also notified ATC of our possible intent to divert. By the time we finished reviewing the checklist and by the time the Captain had terminated discussions with the aforementioned agencies, we were now much closer to ZZZ and actually in a position to make a near normal profile descent into the ZZZ airport. At this time at the lower altitude the engine was operating fine, within vibration limits, even at higher thrust settings. As a precaution we kept the engine at a lower thrust setting. Also, at this point in time the diverting to one of the possible alternates would have necessitated a course reversal. ZZZ seemed like the most reasonable and closest alternate at this point in time. It also had one of the longer runways. I think this was a comforting thought for us, especially after a very long duty day, over 13 hours I think, and a 2am landing. On the previous leg we had experienced a flap malfunction and we landed in ZZZ1 at high speed with no flaps, slats only. We used quite a bit of runway in that scenario. One note to add here. On the walk around in ZZZ1 I noticed a fluid leak from the number 1 engine drain mast. We wrote it up and notified Maintenance. Maintenance decided to do an engine run up. The passengers were deplaned. Then Maintenance changed its mind and decided a run up was not required. The passengers were re boarded. They told us that they had found the problem. It was, I think, one of those 'acceptable parameter' leaks, possibly around the engine oil cooler, but I am not sure about that; I can't remember exactly. Anyway, the item was signed off. I expressed my doubts to the Captain about the efficacy of this fix since no corrective action was actually taken. I do know that some leakage is acceptable in certain cases. When we experienced the vibration problem in flight I also told the Captain that the drain mast leak and the vibration problem were probably related. I have to state here that this is pure conjecture on my part, with no actual proof, but it was my gut feeling as a pilot. I would like to relate what happened on a previous trip a few weeks prior because it may shed some light or have some bearing on the event now in question. Just a couple of weeks prior, I found a similar drain mast leak. They had only one mechanic there and they wanted us (the pilots) to do an engine run up. We refused to do the run up. The flight cancelled and we stayed over night. The next morning two mechanics were flown in and they found the problem. It was an internal engine O ring, in a critical part of the hot section that was 'fried and hardlike plastic', their words not mine. A part was flown in later that morning and the engine repaired. I asked the mechanics if this problem might have caused an in flight engine failure/loss of oil/possible engine shutdown due to fluid loss, etc. The answer was yes. I also asked them if, doing a run up, the leak would have dissipated, or 'gone away', at least to the naked eye, because a static leak could be blown out the back of a running engine. The answer again was yes. I believe we may have likely averted an in flight problem with this engine by refusing the run up and by essentially mandating that the proper number of qualified mechanics properly address the problem.				A320 First Officer experiences high N1 vibration (5 units) at FL350, which increases to 8 units in the next few minutes. As thrust is reduced for descent and landing at destination the vibration is reduced to 1.5 units and does not return.

I started my clock for wake turbulence avoidance as the B757 started its takeoff roll and taxied onto the runway and to the 'takeoff power point' further down the runway at what I judged to be the appropriate speed to arrive at that takeoff power point at the same time that enough time would have expired to have ensured safe separation between us and the departed B757, to also coincide with an expected takeoff clearance at that time. Instead, the SFO Tower cleared us for takeoff much sooner than that, and indicated with that takeoff clearance that there would be traffic holding in position on 28L. We continued at the same speed to the takeoff power point on 01R and I handed the aircraft to the First Officer for takeoff. Halfway through the takeoff roll I noticed in my scan for the first time an aircraft on final for 28R. I felt an abort at that time would have placed us right in its path and so I decided to continue the takeoff, which seemed to be the right choice because it looked to me like the aircraft would touch down after we would have crossed its runway; just moments later SFO Tower directed that aircraft to go-around. I feel that SFO Tower must have expected us to takeoff without delay, thereby allowing more room for the landing aircraft, even though we had not yet reached the takeoff power point, and ignoring the required separation between us and the departed B757. There was no mention of the landing aircraft when we were given the takeoff clearance, the only mention was that of the aircraft waiting in position on 28L. The word 'immediate' was also not used in the takeoff clearance. SFO Tower should not try to rush or squeeze departures between arrivals while ignoring wake turbulence separation standards. I as Captain should have intervened when the First Officer accepted the early takeoff clearance with a demand for more time between us and the departing B757, rather than just taking the time to taxi to the takeoff point without any mention to the Tower. Again I was not aware of the landing aircraft until halfway down the takeoff roll.				Air Carrier departing Runway 1R at SFO elected to slow the takeoff due to 'wake separation' based upon only time, the delay caused a go-around on Runway 28.

As we leveled we encountered light wake turbulence. I was the pilot not flying and was putting away my charts when I heard the clacker and looked up and saw the speed of .827. The First Officer was already reducing thrust. We both noted the autothrottles had disengaged. Our best reasoning is that it disconnected when we hit the wake turbulence as we leveled at altitude. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance via ACARS to report the event and made a logbook entry. We continued the flight to the final destination. We were met by Maintenance and handed the aircraft over to a new crew.				B737-700 Captain reported an overspeed at FL380 following a wake vortex encounter that could have disconnected the autothrottles.

With all programming confirmed and forecast winds loaded, we were vectored off the arrival three times and assigned different altitudes and airspeeds then directed to rejoin the profile and set up for the River Visual from the north to Runway 19. ATC needs to appreciate that the VNAV system calculates an energy optimized descent profile and when disrupted requires pilot intervention to re-establish. Additionally, the protocols for altitude protection are different when on the VNAV path and when using other descent options. Shifting back and forth between the two is labor intensive and increases the risk of violating an altitude/speed restriction. In our case the weather was VMC but the addition of weather avoidance considerations would have added another challenge to the process. We did a great job complying but found ourselves continuously programming, resetting parameters, and confirming we would be able to comply with the next restriction- two of us fully engaged for 20 minutes. It will only be a matter of time before a ball gets dropped. If cleared for a descent profile this complex, do not mess with it. If an aircraft must be asked to leave the profile, don't ask them to return to it. I will not accept this amount of mixed descent requirements in the future.				B737-800 Captain detailed the problems that arise when VNAV equipped aircraft are vectored off the arrival and subsequently asked to return to the published arrival.

[Center] told us about the 747 and even elaborated that it was a 'brand new' airplane. My First Officer and I mentioned to each other the implications of being behind the 747 and I had read once about its new wing design and wondered what kind of wake the plane might cause. The 747 soon was out of sight and we elected to climb to FL380 for a better ride. First Officer was flying and somewhere around FL375 we encountered the most violent wake turbulence I've ever experienced. I took control of our aircraft and for a brief moment could not stop the roll to the right. I lowered the nose because the airspeed had decrease; I had the stall bar in view (HUD) as well. I elected to descend quickly and told [Center] that we were in 'that guys wake' and they said no problem; descend to whatever we needed and also to offset to the upwind side of our route.Once we regained control of our aircraft, we checked on the flight attendants and passengers. Two or three passengers had bumped their heads and all three of our flight attendants were momentarily airborne/off their feet. We made sure a medical divert was not needed and continued to [destination]. We called Dispatch and informed them that the aircraft would be written up for a severe turbulence encounter. I communicated with the flight attendants and made sure no one needed paramedics upon arrival.Not sure I have an answer. Some of these bigger and newer aircraft (747-800 or whatever it's called and the A380) I really don't want to be anywhere behind them. Incidentally, [Center] said we were 13 miles behind this aircraft when this event took place. It was eye-opening to say the least.		[Narrative 2 had no additional information]		A B737-700 encountered severe wake turbulence in trail of B747-800 that was almost 14 NM ahead of them, resulting in strong roll to the right and loss of altitude.

Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS. We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of right rolling. Autopilot handled it, though I quickly moved my hands to the yoke to be ready to take the aircraft away from the autopilot if necessary. At this point I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900. We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The -900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were. Both aircraft were climbing. No injuries in the back though the flight attendants were up and about preparing to start their service. My concern afterward was that our separation from the lead aircraft at 11 miles was enough that we could just as easily have been following a heavy aircraft with a much stronger wake.				B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop.

The performance computer was on an MEL so all performance data had been received from Dispatch.  When the Vref and target were entered into the FMC, there was only one knot difference from what Dispatch gave us and what the FMC was showing for a Vref speed.  At about 100 feet AGL, we got an automated 'airspeed low' call out.  The First Officer, who was the flying pilot, added power but our airspeed was at 123 knots +/- two knots.  He was right on speed.  At this time I noticed that the 'LE flaps transit' light was illuminated.  I also noted that the MASI speeds looked like they were set for flaps 15 and that the 'speedbrake do not arm' light was illuminated.  As the First Officer added power, the 'airspeed low' automated call out stopped and the MASI speeds looked like they went back to a flaps 30 setting.  Out of reflex, I disarmed the speedbrake knowing that I could manually deploy it at touchdown.  I almost always make sure that the speedbrake has fully deployed by hand anyway.  At about 30 feet AGL the MASI [Mach airspeed indicator] speed went back to what looked like a Flaps 15 setting and we got the automated 'airspeed low' call out again.  Within a second or so we landed and I deployed the speedbrake by hand.  After we landed the LE FLAPS went from amber 'LE flaps transit' to green 'LE flaps ext' and the MASI went back to what looked like a setting for Flaps 30. At the gate I wrote up the LE flaps and notified Maintenance.  They came out and inspected the flaps and did a bite check on the PSEU [proximity sensor electric unit].  The only fault noted was an over voltage on some of the LE flap sensors.  This whole event lasted about four seconds plus or minus one or two seconds.  On reflection, it may have been better for me to command a go-around and try to figure out what the aircraft was doing, but I really believe that by the time we would have reacted and commanded a go-around, we would have touched down anyway.  We were too low, and it all happened too fast with multiple related and unrelated system indications. After talking to Maintenance, I believe that we received some sort of power surge that made the aircraft computers lose track of how it was configured.  One second it thought it was at Flaps 15 and the next second it thought it was back at Flaps 30.  Then back to Flaps 15 and then at touchdown, back to Flaps 30.  The flap indicator indicated Flaps 30 the whole time and I did not have time to look on the overhead panel and see if it was showing the LE Flaps fully extended.  I don't know if this has ever happened to anyone else, but maybe we should get our Safety Department to take a look and see if something like this has ever occurred before.				B737-700 Captain reports 'airspeed low' call out at 100 feet during approach along with a LE flaps transit light.  Power is added by the flying First Officer, although the aircraft is on speed, and the warning silences.  The approach is continued and the cycle repeats once more prior to touch down.

During cruise flight we began to notice an increase in our fuel burn compared to the flight plan. After two hours in flight we were down by 1,000 LBS. After four hours we were down by 3,000 LBS, after six hours we were down by 4,000 LBS. We contacted Dispatch and also contacted our Engine Shop Technicians to determine the possible extra fuel burn. Since the fuel burn was going to burn into my required reserve and alternate fuel required for landing at ZZZZ, I decided to divert into ZZZZ1. We landed at ZZZZ1 and refueled and than continued on to ZZZZ.		Flight from ZZZ to ZZZZ. Entire flight fuel burn was well below flight progress numbers and flight plan even though flight plan profile was flown.

As per the previous ATIS, I had selected the ILS 28R approach in the database, but the current ATIS advised to expect visual approaches to Runway 28L and 28R. I was not familiar with the San Francisco approaches and began reviewing the visual approaches available. I was just asking the Captain which approach he thought we would get when we got a descent assignment as well as an approach assignment. I put the approach into the database and began looking at the approach plate. As we descended through 18,000 FT we set our altimeters to the current altimeter setting and I mentioned the descent checklist, but didn't call for it as I knew it required an approach briefing. I read through the approach plate and began to brief it but was interrupted and distracted several times by step down altitude assignments, speed assignments, and traffic call outs for the parallel runway. My briefing for the approach came late and in a hurried manner. Aircraft configuration for the approach as well as the descent and approach checklists also were called for and completed late. There was a 777 on a parallel approach off to our left, and a B737 aircraft being cleared for takeoff on an intersecting runway. Our landing runway was in sight, but with all the distractions and contributing factors above I descended below 1,000 FT before being fully configured and below the glideslope. Descending through 2,200 FT, I was still above profile, flaps set at two or three, and had the speed brakes extended. The altitude set in the FCU was 1,800 FT, the lowest altitude at the end of the approach. As I didn't want the aircraft to level off at 1,800 FT, I selected 100 FT (field elevation) in the FCU altitude selector for the visual approach. My Captain was just questioning my altitude when we received a low altitude alert from the Controller. This was approximately 2 miles from the threshold and approximately 500 FT AGL. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and arrested the descent. I then re-intercepted the glide slope and continued down it to an uneventful landing. We considered going around but had parallel traffic on the left, departing traffic off to the right, terrain straight ahead, and our long landing runway in sight straight ahead. The best solution would have been to ask for an expected approach long before we finally received it. This would've helped provide the time I needed to review and then brief the approach. Because I am much more familiar with them, if we would've been assigned an ILS approach, probably none of this would ever have happened. I take responsibility and should have been better prepared for an unfamiliar airport and its approaches. There always are and always will be step down altitude assignments and traffic callouts that can be distracting and we must contend with. Thereafter, when I realized the descent and later the approach checklists were going to be delayed I should've asked for vectors around for another approach. Realizing this and requesting it early would have probably minimized any errors. The biggest mistake I actively made was setting the FCU altitude to field elevation instead of 1,000 FT above field elevation. If I would've done this, a 1,000 FT floor would have been set. It would have alerted us that I needed to get fully configured before continuing down, as well as precluded us from getting a low altitude alert. Earlier, more proactive, and more thorough preparation would have prevented the above situation.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information.]		An A320 First Officer, unfamiliar with the SFO FMS Bridge Visual, was not expecting the level of work required to stay on profile and descended to 500 FT on a two mile final before a Low Altitude alert reminded the crew to return to the profile.

As we continued to wait for the final weights from load planning we began approaching the intersection of Taxiway A and Taxiway W. As we approached the above intersection I went 'heads down' to switch the aircraft radio to Tower frequency and to enter the 'address' for Load Planning into ACARS in regards to not receiving the final weights. After performing the two above tasks, I looked up and noticed that we were passing over the hold short line to Runway 10L at Taxiway A and Taxiway J. We traveled a short distance past the line and then the Captain stopped the airplane. We then advised BOI Tower that we had passed the hold short line for Runway 10L.		The A320 stopped well past the hold line. As a result a Cessna on approach was sent around to avoid landing over the top of the Airbus. I was CIC and noticed the event simultaneously with the Controller who was being relieved at the time and prompted the assuming Controller at Local Control to send the Cessna around.		When an A320 flight crew was distracted by receiving their final weight and balance numbers from their company they inadvertently crossed the hold short line of the runway to which they had been cleared. ATC directed a Cessna on final approach to go around due to the incursion.

Starting Number 1 Engine first we got smoke and a very foul odor (smelled like dirty gym socks) in the flight deck. As soon as Number 1 [Engine] was started the smoke and smell begin to decrease. We believed the cause was the start unit and continued with start of Number 2 [Engine]. We made a PA to the passengers indicating it was not the airplane, but the starting unit causing the smoke and smell. We advised Ground Operations to have the ground start unit checked. As we taxied out for takeoff, the flight deck and cabin improved, but did not completely clear of the foul odor. As we raised the landing gear after takeoff, we got a Master Caution, Flt Control and HYD annunciations. There were no lights overhead. Checking hydraulic indications and aircraft handling, everything was normal. Right about 10,000 FT the flight attendants called and said that during the takeoff and climb the cabin had gotten smoky and smelly again. I decided to return to the departure airport and advised Departure Control. The First Officer flew the aircraft and I ran the Smoke in Cabin Checklist, advised airport Ground Operations and passengers before returning to normal flight duties for approach and landing. We requested the fire equipment personnel observe the airplane as we landed for any indications of a problem. After clearing the runway, we checked with the flight attendants as to the cabin condition and were advised that it had gotten better. The smoke was mostly gone, but the bad smell was still there. As there were no indications of a continuing problem, we continued taxi into the gate. Maintenance met the aircraft and said the airplane really smelled bad as did the ground start unit. They also said they could smell an additional smell of hydraulics. We de-planed aircraft at gate and checked on the passengers to see if everyone was OK. No one indicated any problems. We proceeded to a new gate and aircraft and continued on. I am not sure what could be done to prevent this in the future. If the ground start unit was in better condition, we would not have had the original smoke and smell issue. At this time I do not know what caused the return of smoke and smell to the cabin during and after takeoff or if there was any connection between this and the momentary hydraulic lights after raising the gear.	The Reporter reaffirmed the odor but believes that the smell was from the ground start unit which was particularly 'stinky' during preflight and ground start. He did not know why the APU was MEL'ed. At the gate, maintenance personnel thought that a slight hydraulic fluid odor was present in the cabin. The hydraulic system abnormals which illuminated the Master Caution were momentary and all returned to normal during the return to the departure airport. Maintenance found no hydraulic system anomalies.	Masks were donned and I leveled the aircraft at 12,000 FT while the Captain informed ATC that we would need to return to the airport. The Captain initiated checklist items for smoke and fumes as I coordinated with ATC for return to the departure airport. Fumes appeared to dissipate during the approach. Approach, landing, and return to gate were uneventful.		A B737-700 developed a dirty gym socks odor during engine start which cleared somewhat. After takeoff as the landing gear was raised, momentary Master Caution, FLT CTL, and HYD annunciations were seen with no secondary indications. During climb, the odor reoccurred and the aircraft was returned to the departure airport.

Disconnected autopilot and corrected to visual approach. I believe the ILS at MTPP should be tested for accuracy and proper functioning. I fly this [approach] a lot and observe the glide slope and localizer to be erratic constantly. The problem is, it is insidious and if you don't fly this [approach] a lot it can take someone by surprise. It acts like it is working normal then the glideslope slowly drifts up or down slowly. Suggest using only RNAV approaches.				The MTPP Runway 10 ILS glideslope rose slowly then quickly dropped, causing a B737-800 autopilot to chase it at an unacceptable rate down. The autopilot was disconnected and a visual approach completed.

Approach was very gusty and included heavy precipitation at times. About the time of calling for gear down Tower reported a Regional Jet three miles ahead as we went IFR in heavy showers. Pilot flying called for S turns and began maneuvering for spacing while trying to acquire the Regional Jet visually. Rejoining final approach course at approximately 700 FT and made an uneventful landing. On taxi cleanup while First Officer brought flap handle up he noticed flap setting read 10 degrees and suspects that landing was made at 10 degrees setting. Both pilot flying and pilot not flying were so focused on attaining separation on the other aircraft and maintaining course, glide path and proper airspeed that we missed the 1,000 FT call. The approach was challenging with the weather, winds and ATC calls all happening at the same time. Possible solution may be to move the 1,000 FT 'Landing checklist complete' call to 1,500 FT.		Our flight involved extensive holding, a diversion, additional holding en route, and eventual approach to MIA in very windy (crosswind) conditions. The winds were nearly 90 degrees to runway heading and approximately 20 KTS. Light rain was reported, and approach path was turbulent. We acquired the runway several miles out, visual conditions but in rain which required high speed wipers. On final at approximately 1,500 AGL Tower cleared us to land and requested that we slow to final approach speed for Regional Jet traffic ahead. We could not slow any further because we were already at flaps 15 approach speed. I considered changing to a flaps 30 configuration but, ironically, I thought we might not get fully configured by 1,000 AGL and we would either have to go-around or get a FOQA phone call, so I opted to keep flaps 15. First Officer executed an S turn to the south to gain separation from the Regional Jet ahead. Rain increased in intensity as we approached runway, we were very preoccupied with the traffic separation, the huge crab due to the crosswind, the decreasing visibility due to rain, and the turbulence, all of which contributed to our not catching the fact that flaps were not at 15 but at 10. Landing was normal, with a slight bounce and normal rollout. First Officer executed a good approach and landing in very difficult conditions.I cannot stress enough just how aware I am of the seriousness of our error, in spite of the normal outcome. I need to put increased emphasis on monitoring the checklist, even when conditions outside the airplane may be more difficult than normal and requiring more of our attention. Checklist must prevail. Secondly, when conditions are challenging and there is no operational requirement for flaps 15, I will remain with flaps 30/40 which will provide me with a landing flap configuration warning if flaps are not set properly. At flaps 15, we use the 'flap inhibit' switch which disables any warning. While on downwind First Officer called for flaps 2, which is not normally used, I don't remember but if he then called for flaps 10, I might have then gone to flaps 5 (next slot) and so when he called for flaps 15, I might have gone to flaps 10 (next slot). I don't know if this is what happened, but it if did it certainly contributed to the final outcome, of course we should have visually verified the flap position on the gauge and the handle.		B737-800 flight crew reports planning a flaps 15 landing due to strong gusty crosswinds then becoming distracted during the approach and landing with flaps set to 10 degrees.

All were phantom and required a descent and then a climb on final. Finally for sure it was fake and we just had to fly with it on. It went away at 1,500 FT or so.	The Reporter stated that his aircraft type was a B737-800 which he has many flight hours in and has never seen this type event before. They were at 3,300 FT flying downwind and were given a 90 degree turn for a vector crosswind to final when the TCAS alerted TRAFFIC. The Reporter expanded the TCAS range and initially did not see traffic until a RA was displayed directly in front of the aircraft with a DESCEND command. The Reporter, the flying pilot, began a descent but the Captain became alarmed by the airspeed increase and the flaps 5 speed limit. Additional confusion ensued because of the frequency change to Tower. ATC reported helicopter traffic at 300 FT but that could not have been the traffic displayed. The TCAS then commanded CLIMB but both pilots realized at that time the false TCAS commands and continued the approach to a normal landing.	Received TCAS TA followed by an RA turning final to Runway 9. Followed TCAS guidance and reported to ATC. Landed normally. No traffic was observed.		A B737-800 crew reported a TCAS null bus fault with a DESCEND then CLIMB command at 3,300 FT while being vector crosswind to final.

After considerable rolls from side to side and yawing, I clicked off the autopilot and leveled off to stabilize the aircraft and then continued the descent. This caused us to be about 500/700 feet high at CSN. There were no traffic conflicts and ATC did not mention it. We should have had a little more spacing with the aircraft in front due to the quartering tailwind.		[Narrative 2 contained no additional information]		B737-700 reported encountering wake vortex on arrival to BWI, resulting in roll and yaw issues that resulted in their failure to make a crossing restriction.

The First Officer airspeed display was stuck at approximately 235 KIAS/.74 Mach. After minor adjustments to cruise speed and careful cross checks, it was determined that the Captain's airspeed was properly functioning, but the First Officer airspeed was not. The flight used the satphone to call Dispatch and asked for a conference call with Maintenance to see if any additional information was available, solutions or ideas to correct it, or if any additional concerns might be warranted. Nothing was provided by Maintenance and Dispatch provided an updated VFR weather report for [destination]. As the aircraft began the descent the First Officer's indicated airspeed decreased through the red stall range to 45 KIAS (zero), and the First Officer Altitude Disagree Caution also displayed at this time.Shortly after both of the aircraft engine EEC's went to alternate mode and several related VNAV features and displays went blank, while Autopilot A reverted to CWS for pitch. The First Officer's altimeter continued to descend slower than the Captain's, and the First Officer's primary altitude indication at 8,000 FT MSL was approximately 800-900 FT higher than the Captain's. The flight declared an emergency during descent, and landed on a visual approach without further event. During final approach at approximately 1,000 AGL, the First Officer's instruments returned to normal readings. After landing the Maintenance Representative told us that the aircraft had experienced a similar event that occurred earlier in the month, but this information was not relayed until after the flight had landed. In addition the Maintenance Representative at [destination] had not been notified of the inbound aircraft problems. The logbook write up for the previous event was recorded in an older section of the active logbook, and was not mentioned by Maintenance when the flight called [Operations] requesting assistance.				B737-800 First Officer reported a number of Air Data Computer related failures or malfunctions, including First Officer's airspeed indicator, altitude disagree, EEC to alternate mode, and autopilot issues.

The Controller never responded for about 30 seconds, and then assigned us FL370 and to be there in 2 minutes. This didn't give us time any time to decide. We started climbing. I saw an aircraft on TCAS 1,000 FT higher than us, but I couldn't determine if it would conflict with our path and climb. After climbing 1,600 FT in about 1 minute 50 seconds we got a TA on the traffic, a B747 at FL360. He queried the ATC Controller about us. I then reported that we had the traffic in sight. We continued climbing to FL370 and after the 2 minutes had expired, we were 200-300 FT low with no extra energy to increase the climb rate. The ATC Controller never made any comments, but I felt a less than friendly attitude from him. I know that normally, it takes 3 minutes at high altitudes, to climb 2,000 FT typically, when requesting an en route climb; the ATC Controller will ask us how long it will take, if there is conflicting traffic. This Controller didn't ask. If he had, we would have told him that we needed 3 minutes. However, he never gave us any time to discuss this. We should have denied the climb, but we thought that we could make it in time, if we traded speed for altitude. The Controller never should have put us or the other aircraft, in this position. Jet aircraft at high altitude, reach a point that speed decreases to the point that climb is not possible, until energy increases again. I don't think that the Controller, forcing the issue in this case, knows this. I did, and should have refused the climb until clear of any conflict.Always have at least 3 minutes to climb 2,000 FT at cruise altitudes. Don't let an ATC Controller force you into a 'coffin corner' box.				A320 flight crew receceived a TCAS TA while attempting to comply with ATC instruction to climb from FL350 to FL370 in two minutes.

Our conversation included old food in the ovens or coffee that had spilled onto the hot pad. In the cockpit, we only had a faint smell of cheap perfume or a weak solvent. The consensus was that the odor was dissipating after a few minutes, but 5-10 minutes later the Lead Flight Attendant called to say that she and 2 other flight attendants were experiencing respiratory distress (burning throats, irritated nasal passages) as well as irritated eyes. The First Officer and I didn't notice any irritation, but elected to go on oxygen as a precaution and declared an emergency and diverted back to the departure airport. The Lead Flight Attendant was cared for by a paramedic/passenger and then was cared for by paramedics that had met the aircraft at the gate. I don't know what caused the event, but the number one engine had been replaced and this was the first revenue flight for that engine. The IDG oil cooler on that same engine was also replaced during the same maintenance session. When cabin odor reports are submitted, an extensive checklist is followed to try to isolate the source of the odor. Why not use the same checklist to inspect the aircraft any time a piece is replaced that has a direct contact with the pneumatic system or air recirculation. One step further would be a requirement for a test flight.				An A320 Lead Flight Attendant became ill after a strong electrical smell developed in the forward galley during climb, an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

Below is the chain of events. Based on the time stamp in the 'last leg maintenance report.' We first experienced a data hit: 'Invalid Disk/MDDU.' I noticed that the MDDU panel light came on/lit up. I thought it said, 'Ready,' then, 'Invalid Disk.' After obtaining an updated ATIS a little less then a hour before arrival, Captain changed the runway on the Number 1 FMGC, from Runway 1 to Runway 19. After the insert key was pushed, the Captain's map was lost and FMGC Number 1 froze up. The message in scratch pad said to wait. FMGC Number 2 displayed 'Independent Operation' in the scratch pad. The FMA's displayed 1FD2, and remained so for the duration of the flight. We referred to the Flight Manual and the system reset procedures. We then attempted to reset the Number 1 MCDU CB on the overhead Panel 49. This procedure restored the ACARS functions but not the FMGC. It appeared that we could only get the status page for the FMGC. Thus, no other buttons such as RAD/NAV etc would function. Note: We subsequently received a 'GPWS TERR' ECAM and secured it per the ECAM procedure. Later we attempted a second attempt to reset the Number 1 MCDU which also failed. Maintenance was notified via ACARS of the situation. We also briefed the NAV/ILS tuning to ensure we would have the ILS information displayed on both sides. Note: Prior to LOC intercept the First Officer was flying with the autopilot on. When we started to intercept the final approach course the autopilot began to turn right vs. left on the intercept. In other words, our raw data was showing that we needed to turn opposite of the FD course information. We were getting ambiguous information at a critical time on both sides. With the runway visually acquired, the First Officer turned his FD off and followed raw data. On final about 1,500 FT AGL we received a 'landing elevation fault.' The system status panel showed the elevation was zero, Captain elected to wait till after rollout to deal with CAB PR ECAM and focused on the final checklist and SOP call outs. When managed speed selected on final, we did not have a 'speed bug' on the tape. We flew the remainder of the approach without approach speed bug reference and we used the adjusted VLS plus 5 KT speed that was displayed in the MCDU, about 140 KTS. On landing rollout, the pressurization outflow valve failed closed and a CAB PR ECAM was displayed and directed us to manually open the outflow valve, which we did. Once fully open, the ECAM cleared and we taxied to the gate. Upon landing, Maintenance was briefed in detail. Maintenance told me they have received reports of bugs since the last FMGC software update was installed. I was informed that this should be corrected on the next update cycle. Maintenance also said that based on the data he downloaded from our inbound flight; it appeared we actually experienced a dual FMGC failure or full failure of Number 1 and a partial failure of Number 2 FMGC. The multiple failures of cabin pressure, etc compounded our workload at a very critical time and not to mention at the end of a red eye flight. Good review of standby navigation procedures and anomalies.				An A320 crew was notified after flight that the FMGC failure they had experienced in flight is believed caused by a 'bug' in a recent software update.

On approach Purser called cockpit to report electrical odor again in first class cabin area. We declared [an] emergency and made normal landing. Proceeded to gate after fire rescue again checked the aircraft and odor dissipated and offloaded passengers. Three flight attendants complain of headache, nausea, and scratchy throat. All three were treated by paramedics.		[Narrative 2 has no additional information]		After previously diverting en route for an odor and with the Cargo Fan MELed, the flight continued to the filed destination where on approach the odor returned. So an emergency was declared and the crew donned oxygen masks for a short approach. Several flight attendants reported being ill.

Localizer and G/S captured and missed approach altitude set. [We] started to configure the aircraft. Airspeed was approximately 205 KTS. First Officer called for flaps 1, then flaps 5, gear down. After I positioned the gear handle down I looked at the flap indicator to confirm degrees of flaps and noticed that the flaps had not advanced beyond 1/2 to 1 degree. I started to say something was wrong with the flaps when we got a Master Caution Light and we then determined that we had indeed lost the B System hydraulics. There was no oil in the B System. B LOW PRESSURE lights on and yaw damper had kicked off. 6 miles out and runway insight, gear down and on speed and on slope for the no flap configuration. Declared an emergency, requested Crash and Fire and was cleared to land. We got the QRH out and started to run very long System B fail checklist and then discussed landing on this runway with no trailing flaps as opposed to taking this aircraft up again with approximately 6,000 LBS of fuel and maybe even developing more problems than we had. Very quickly we then discussed the systems that had failed such as normal brakes and auto brakes, spoilers and that we still had alternate brakes and the left thrust reverser. We then discussed the fact that we have been trained for no flap maneuver and we knew what to expect as far as the aircraft pitch attitude and to control the rate of decent prior to touchdown. We decided that we wanted to take advantage of this 12,000 FT dry, grooved runway with Crash and Fire available and that was now about 4 miles in front of us and decided to land with flaps in the up position. Stopped the B FAIL checklist and ran the normal landing checklist and the gear was down and locked. [We] maintained a speed of ref 40+40 until touchdown. [We] landed inside the touchdown zone at about 1,000 FT, speedbrakes out and the 1 thrust reverser in operation. Applied manual brakes with constant pressure and the aircraft decelerated at a very comfortable and consistent rate. Alternate brakes worked as advertised. We could have made Intersection N with the braking performance that the alternate braking system provided us but [we] let the aircraft roll out to Intersection P at a very nice rate with minimum braking pressure required. Cleared at P and did the after landing check told Ground that we need to pull off to the side and stop the aircraft because our ability to stop and steer the aircraft in close quarters was in doubt. Ground told us to taxi onto the W line and switch to Ramp frequency. We then asked Ramp to have Crash and Fire drive around the aircraft and assess any damages that they spotted and pass that along to us as that would help us make more sound decisions about taking care of our crew and passengers and aircraft. Crash and Fire reported no fire or smoke and could not see any visible damage to the aircraft. Contacted the cabin crew and briefed them on our situation and they reported that they and our passengers were fine. Contacted Maintenance and Operations and briefed them about the loss of the B System and requested a tow to gate. Made a PA explaining our situation to the passengers and ask for their cooperation in this matter. Started the APU and shut down both engines and was then towed to the gate. All of our passengers deplaned the aircraft saying thanks you and good job as we said good bye to them. We then had a debrief with our cabin crew and they said that they didn't feel anything out of the ordinary on landing. They then went on to work another segment. Put the write up in the book. Maintenance came up to the aircraft and told me that the B System autopilot aileron actuator had failed and that the wheel well was covered with oil. Maintenance took control of aircraft.		[Narrative 2 contained no additional information.]		A B737-800 Aileron Autopilot Actuator failed on final approach at flaps 1 causing the loss of System B Hydraulic Fluid so an emergency was declared, the airspeed adjusted and the flight continued to a normal no flap landing.

We were cruising at FL370 on as planned heading towards DUSAN Intersection. As we exited the Dominican FIR, the Captain contacted Curacao Control, with jurisdiction of Aruba, our destination. Instead of proceeding directly to DUSAN, we were cleared to fly direct to the 10 mile final fix for the ILS 11 and to descend at pilot's discretion to 9,000 FT. That's what we were expecting.As we approached 9,000 FT and in the vicinity of 37 NM from BEA, we were switched to Tower frequency. We knew we were entering a non-radar environment. Tower was overseeing clearance, Ground, Tower and Regional Approach all on one frequency. The Tower frequency was very congested and you could tell the Controller was very busy yet was doing a good job. When he acknowledged our frequency check-in, he informed us that an MD80 had just reported inbound on the ILS and 15 miles out from BEA and that we were number two behind him.We overheard conversation between the Controller and the MD80 but couldn't understand because they were speaking in Spanish. The Controller asked us our groundspeed and DME from BEA VOR and the Captain replied about 35 DME at 330 KTS (I can't remember exactly). At no time was the MD-80 on our Nav Display with the transponder traffic knob in the 'look down' position. The Controller asked us to slow down for separation and I slowed the aircraft to 250 KTS. At this point we were just within 30 miles out from the field. In the meantime, several ATC exchanges with other aircraft occurred. At this point we were getting high so I slowed the aircraft to 150 KIAS with flaps at two. We flew in this configuration for two to three minutes and were approaching the 10 mile final fix on the ILS approach. The Captain repeatedly asked for lower and we were given 6,000 FT. I commanded the gear down and flaps 3. As briefed earlier, I turned all automation off including autothrust and started the descent manually to get a more prompt response and so as not to be too overwhelmed with automation. We were now turning inbound 10 miles from the BEA VOR. Visibility was excellent, there were no clouds in the vicinity of the airport and the airport was in sight the entire time. Although we were high, there was no doubt that we would be stabilized well before 1,000 FT AGL.As we approached 6,000 FT we were cleared to descend first to 4,000 FT, then eventually to 2,000 FT MSL, but were not cleared for the approach. At no time did I have to level off. It was a gradual and stabilized descent intended to capture the glideslope. Between 2,000 and 1,500 FT the Captain--leaning towards his left window as if he was looking down at a boat--suddenly shouted 'break right - break right, now!' while pointing his finger down. I knew right away he meant there was traffic directly below us so I banked aggressively to the right, added significant power, pitched up and leveled off. Immediately, we heard the caution 'TRAFFIC - TRAFFIC.' I was not looking inside so I don't know what the lowest separation was but after my maneuver the TCAS showed -800 FT. At no point did I see the traffic. When I was established in the turn, the Captain advised ATC we just had a near mid-air collision within 200 FT of the MD80 and we were abandoning the approach. ATC cleared us to continue the turn and rejoin the approach after which we were cleared for and landed uneventfully.It was clear to us that the MD80 flight crew clearly lied about their position from the VOR so as to be number one for the approach. There is no way we would have been able to catch them since we were around 30 miles out slowing to 150 KTS indicated and still heading directly to the 10 mile final fix on the ILS. Furthermore, I strongly believe that the pilots of the MD80 intentionally turned off their transponder which would explain why we never had an advisory but then suddenly received a 'Traffic' caution at low altitude (I think the RA was inhibited because of our altitude) so as to disguise their real distance from the VOR and to only turn it back on at the last minute. I am obviously outraged about what happened and believe that it was not merely unsafe but criminal to act like this and jeopardize the lives of more than 300 people in order to shave off three to four minutes of flight time.				An A-320 flight crew experienced an NMAC with an MD-80 during initial approach to TNCA. The reporter alleges the MD-80 flight crew purposely mis-stated their position and shut off their transponder to gain an arrival advantage.

Prior to descent, because of the placarded FMC and the filed GIBBZ1 arrival, I had made the decision--because of safety and crew workload--to not accept a 'descend via' clearance. While on Cleveland Center, the flight was cleared to cross BRNDN at FL290. Upon reaching FL290, we were switched to Washington Center.Immediately upon check-in, I informed the Controller that we were unable to descend via the GIBBZ arrival because of a placarded FMC. The Controller told us he was going to have to vector us for a different arrival. We were given vectors to FINKS for the DOCCS1 arrival at IAD. The Controller questioned why we accepted the RNAV arrival from Cleveland Center. At the time we were with Cleveland Center, I had not made a final decision to not accept a 'descend via' clearance. Cleveland had not cleared us for the approach or to 'descend via' the GIBBZ arrival prior to switching to Washington. While on the DOCCS1 arrival, after a frequency change to Potomac Approach, the Controller was confused by the arrival we were on, apparently because he did not receive information about our arrival change from the GIBBZ1. The remainder of the approach and landing were uneventful.The FMC placard specifies no RNAV (RNP) approaches authorized. Although we were not on an RNP approach, because of only one FMC and the intensive descent profile of the GIBBZ1 arrival, I made the decision to not accept a 'descend via' clearance for safety and crew workload. We told center that we could still fly the lateral navigation. Since the MEL did not preclude RNAV arrivals, we could have flown the approach as filed. We could have also informed one of the center controllers prior to Washington Center to give them a heads up, but the final decision to not accept the descent profile was not made until just prior to the switch to Washington Center.				Although technically legal to do so, B737-800 Captain advised ATC the flight was unable to descend 'via' the GIBBZ RNAV STAR to IAD due to a deferred FMC component and requested an alternative arrival. His decision was based on excessive flight crew workload associated with the complex RNAV STAR's multiple speed and altitude restrictions.

Flight progressed normally until 90 minutes from LAX. At this time we received an abnormal amount of vectors and speed reductions. We questioned ATC and were told due to LAX runway closure LAX wants 30 NM in trail. Sent free text message to Dispatcher and informed him of this. No response from Dispatch. Rechecked our fuel several times and determined we would land LAX with over 6.0 of fuel. As I recall, reserve fuel was about 6.7 with an alternate of ONT. We re-discussed the LAX weather and alternate plans with 45 minutes remaining. Weather was 800 broken and 8 miles visibility at the time. Descent and approach was normal. [We] extended gear early to comply with ATC speed and altitude restrictions. This probably burned a little more fuel, but is not an unusual practice on the 737 fleet. Prior to 1,000 FT, with landing checklist completed, we received landing clearance from LAX Tower for Runway 25R. They were also using 25R for takeoff during this time. We had, at some point, heard an aircraft receiving line up and wait on 25R. At 800 FT we were in the clear and I could see the aircraft clearly on the runway threshold. At 600 FT I queried the Tower if our landing clearance was still valid. There was a slight pause and under 400 FT it was clear the other aircraft would not be off the runway prior to our landing. At this point the Controller told us to 'go around and offset left, maintain 2,000 FT.' We initiated a go-around and were told to fly heading 235, maintain 2,000 and contact SCT Departure. Upon contact with Departure I re-verified our heading and altitude and told Departure we had the other aircraft in sight visually. We were then vectored for the approach at 5,000 FT on downwind. The IOE Captain made a PA and checked with the flight attendants. We briefly discussed our fuel and options and concurred landing LAX was best. During the initial go-around our user defined FMS 'using reserve fuel' warning indicated we would land with less than 4,000 LBS at our alternate. I was aware this could happen in the event of a go around. The IOE Captain suggested we declare minimum fuel during the downwind. We did so, and we're advised we would be landing 25R at LAX, 12 mile final. During final approach inside of 5 miles, fuel low warning came on in number 2 tank.....1.95 on gauge. Landed uneventfully, and taxied to gate. [We] shutdown with 4.0 thousand LBS of fuel, slight imbalance of less than 300 LBS.				B737-800 Check Captain describes a low fuel situation arriving LAX due to delays for a runway closure and a go-around caused by an aircraft departure on the landing runway. Gate arrival fuel is 4,000 LBS.

ATC had taken us off of and back on the arrival a few times for spacing. We were then cleared direct TRUPS Intersection and resume the arrival. After passing TRUPS Intersection we continued the descent to cross FRDMM at 8,000 FT. As we were passing 10,400 FT Controller intervened and advised that we had not been given a new altitude and then cleared us to 9,000 FT. No conflict was noted by the flight crew or indicated by the Controller. I suggest when giving a clearance to resume an RNAV STAR that the Controller verbalize either a maintain altitude or give the clearance to descend via the arrival to avoid any miscommunication.	The reporter confirmed that they had, indeed, originally been cleared 'via' the STAR and then vectored off. He was uncertain, but believed that when they were vectored they had also been cleared to descend to 11,000; which is also the crossing restriction at TRUPS. When ATC cleared them 'direct to TRUPS' and to 'resume the STAR' they interpreted that 'resume' meant they were, again, cleared 'via' the STAR and--lacking a new cleared altitude--could descend 'via' the balance of the arrival as they would have had they not been vectored off it.He also advised their aircraft was a -800 model B737, equipped with fully functional FMS VNAV capability including autothrottles. When allowed to fly even the most complex STARs in their entirety the system routinely performs perfectly and it is only when it is necessary for ATC to interrupt the arrival that errors such as this occur.			After they were vectored off the TRUPS RNAV STAR to DCA for spacing the flight crew of a B737-800 assumed that a clearance 'direct to TRUPS, resume the STAR' included the clearance to resume descent on the arrival. ATC disagreed, believing they should have maintained their last assigned altitude independent of the STAR restrictions.

Later, while in flight, we received an ECAM alert for a pack overheat on the inoperative pack. We were surprised to say the least. We complied with the ECAM procedures and monitored the inoperative pack and the overheat condition. As we were scheduled to continue on with this aircraft we sent a message to Dispatch refusing the aircraft for the next leg. On arrival to our destination, while at approximately 5,000 FT the Duty Flight Manager sent an ACARS message asking me to rescind my refusal and take the broken aircraft [notwithstanding the] inoperative yet overheating pack. As we were in sterile cockpit at the time we disregarded the message until we we're on the ground with the engines off and all checklists completed. I contacted the Dispatcher to see if he had authorized the ACARS message and he said 'no.' I then contacted the Duty Flight Manager to find out why he was pushing me to fly the broken aircraft. Then, as soon as I got off the phone with him, two local flight managers were at the aircraft to tell me to fly the aircraft. I politely spoke to them about the aircraft status and they left. This pilot pushing is unacceptable, especially violating sterile cockpit regulations and having two flight managers come to the aircraft.				An A320 Captain expressed his displeasure at being pushed by three flight managers to accept an aircraft which, on their previous leg, had received an ECAM warning for an overheat condition in the left air conditioning pack which had been previously deferred inoperative. As required by the MEL, the pack was selected off prior to and during the flight on which the overheat warning was received.

On approach with the laser blaring in our faces put the gear down to have a 2 line ECAM. AUTO BRKS on line 1 and NORM BRKS on line 2. Went missed approach at 10,000' and asked for delay vector while trying to relay the position of the laser to the tower and running the ECAM's. Went to the book and found the AUTO BRKS page which said to go to the adjusted landing distance table. Started looking for the NORM BRKS and never could find it in the book. Now running short on time and fuel with the laser still flashing us. Did not have time to call Dispatch or Maintenance and the landing distance says to add multiple failures together to get the correct required landing distance but nothing in the book for the NORM BRKS ECAM. We were WITHOUT guidance on an ECAM from our books. The only book reference was to adjust the landing distance as we have no auto brakes and no normal brakes and it had no guidance for the 2 failures. We are now test pilots. Decided to reset the Antiskid Switch even though there was no procedure calling for it! It worked and the ECAMs cleared off. After landing and talking with Maintenance it took another 20 minutes for them to figure out it was a failure of one of the BSCU computers. We had switched from the bad computer to the good computer by turning OFF and ON the antiskid switch with the gear up on the missed approach. The ECAM was misleading and totally worthless in helping to fix this issue as it said nothing about a BSCU failure. Lately however I have heard of numerous BSCU failures. The Captain had a picture of the number 1 and number 3 tires that he blew on landing with a failed BSCU. I had a total loss of nosewheel steering due to a failed BSCU that was not resettable in flight and had to have a tug at the runway to tow us to the gate just a couple weeks ago. The Mechanic said another 320 just blew some tires in landing a month ago on landing with a failed BSCU. The next day I called the Tower and delivered a street map with the exact streets where the laser was coming from so they stop the laser flasher. The Tower admitted that this was a common problem at this airport and even the Tower was lasered on a different occasion. Never before had anyone given the Tower a map with the street address so they were very happy and surprised because they were thinking it was in a different location.	The Reporter stated that his Company began a series of Airbus upgrades about a year ago which has lead to numerous aircraft systems malfunctions. The BSCU is one component which appears to be malfunctioning with some regularity and the checklist does not consistently correct the problems. One recent BSCU fault which the Reporter experienced at cruise altitude was not corrected after cycling the ANTI SKID AND N/W STRG switch but after landing with no nose wheel steering, setting the parking brake and cycling the switch, the fault was corrected. During the current event cycling the ANTI SKID AND N/W STRG switch with the gear up did work. So even though a BSCU fault was indicated no BSCU FAULT ECAM was given. The Reporter also adamantly discussed the eye discomfort he experienced after the laser illumination. He was amazed at the power and accuracy of the laser beam during the twenty minutes or so as the crew was trouble shooting the anti skid problem. His eye discomfort lasted about two weeks.			An A320 ECAM alerted AUTO BRKS and NORM BRKS when the gear was extended for landing but no corresponding NORM BRKS checklist was found so during the go around the crew cycled the ANTISKID switch as per the AUTO BRKS ECAM which switched to the alternate BSCU and removed the ECAM alerts. During this event the cockpit was illuminated by a green laser which appeared to have a lock on and which caused eye discomfort.

My company requires us to be in the landing configuration by the final approach fix. Tower asked us to maintain 180 KTS to the marker; we declined and offered 160 KTS so that we could be configured, yet allow us to be stabilized by 1,000 FT. ATC not pleased. On landing rollout, with a slight tailwind, wet runway and 3/4 visibility and decelerating through 85 KTS Tower tells us to take H4 Taxiway, then H5 Taxiway. We did not answer until we were slowed to taxi speed. During this same time Tower cleared another carrier to takeoff on Runway 12 which intersects Runway 9, our landing runway. We were able to stop short of Runway 12, and then Tower canceled the takeoff clearance for the other plane. We were never given any land and hold short instructions, which we would have declined, before landing. Tower said that if we wanted to use the whole runway then we need to tell them before hand. My understanding is that the runway is mine until clearing to taxi and don't have to tell them that information. We cleared and taxied to the gate. This was a potentially dangerous situation because of Tower's noncompliance with regulations.				A B737-800 pilot reports being instructed to maintain 180 KTS to the FAF for Runway 9 by ATC and advising unable. Upon landing ATC instructs the crew to turn off at H4 then H5 (no longer exist) then cancels the takeoff clearance of an aircraft departing on Runway 12. The B737 crew is admonished by ATC for not advising that they will be using the whole runway.

The First Officer engaged the DES mode and managed speed after I set the bottom altitude in the MCP. We verified the restrictions on the MCDU and on the ND. After making the first several crossings with no problem, the First Officer and I briefed the approach. At this time the autopilot seemed to 'go dumb' and continued descending below the next crossing altitude. The FMA still indicated DES mode engaged, but the autopilot was descending below profile. The First Officer disengaged the autopilot and climbed the jet to meet the restriction. The doughnut and the PROG page displayed correct information, but the autopilot was not maintaining the profile. We then reverted to the old way of setting the most restrictive altitude and the cockpit workload went through the roof as there are 15 altitude and 5 airspeed restrictions on this arrival. We attempted DES mode again and it made the altitude crossings, but would not make the airspeed restrictions even though we were in managed speed. We used selected speed to comply with the restrictions.Upon landing, we entered an item for the malfunction and called Maintenance Control. A Mechanic reset the FMGCs and we flew the airplane again, but did not have the opportunity to use DES mode on the the following flight. I have seen this problem several times on the Airbus; the autopilot disregards FMGC profiles.	The reporter advised there were no adverse wind or weather effects to complicate the profile.  He stated the initial crossing restrictions were complied with in harmony with the FMGC profile.  He did believe the errors began when they were programming a runway change and speculated that doing so may have overloaded the processing capabilities of the FMGs and suggested the commands to the autoflight system (vertical navigation and authothrottles) may have suffered as a result although they received no ECAM warnings to that effect.  He stressed that the FMGs continued to display appropriate 'descent doughnut' and PROGRESS PAGE predictive altitude displays.  The only computer generated alert was an amber circle around the next waypoint displayed when their actual altitude was below the minimum crossing at that fix.He further speculated on the processing demands of multiple crossing airspeed and altitude windows often spaced only a few miles apart which require the calculations for each approaching window to include computations of what has to be considered for each of the subsequent windows far down stream.  Finally, he stressed his belief that it was the autoflight system, not the FMGs, that erred...with the caveat that the demands on the FMGs may have been such that commands to the autoflight system were compromised.			An A319/20 Captain reported the failure of the aircraft's FMGC and autoflight systems to comply with the altitude and airspeed restrictions while conducting the FRDMM RNAV STAR to DCA.

After [we returned the] bleeds to Normal, both [pneumatic] ducts at 35-right and 40-left, NORMAL. We mulled this over for a few minutes, QRH, checklist, Volume 1 had no information for our situation. I used FMC to contact Dispatch. Passed on info from above and asked to have this relayed to Maintenance Control Technical for an answer. Maintenance Control came back with a Precooler Condition Valve possibly being bad. [I had] never heard of this valve. Looked in MEL and this was addressed, but did not apply once airborne. I asked Maintenance Control, other than this rare instance, how am I supposed to know if this valve failed. He replied that except for this rare instance, I would have no idea. Continued flight [was] uneventful. Dispatch asked for me to write it up as it happened, and she would have Maintenance meet aircraft upon arrival. We arrived, no Maintenance, departed aircraft and went home. Placard Pressure Indicator. I noticed that this aircraft flew [a turn] before late departure. No information about a valve being bad or being placarded. The MEL for this valve (if this was the problem), was not addressed. The MEL said maximum FL250 and no icing. All I can see that was done was placarding the Duct Pressure Gauge. This gauge was working fine. So, was the problem addressed or not. This aircraft was also supposed to fly to [another destination] after a turn. Did Maintenance just push this B737-800 aircraft along without advising the flight crew? This had me a little concerned. As Maintenance Control said, I would not know that there was a problem, especially since they placarded the Duct Pressure Gauge. Provide the Captain with the proper information about the status of aircraft. Read logbook online, [trying] to confirm aircraft was repaired or deferred correctly.	Reporter stated they had the B737-800 in the bleed configuration he describes due to the aircraft's gross weight, high altitude international airport they were departing from and a cool morning.

We learned after the event that Maintenance had had the aircraft 'most of the day,' and had replaced the nose landing gear actuator. Push-back, engine start, taxi out, takeoff, climb, and initial cruise were normal. Approximately one hour into the flight and at level cruise, the Master Caution activated and ECAM indicated a Green Hydraulic System leak. Following our non-normal procedures we turned off the pumps pressurizing the Green System thereby deactivating the Green Hydraulic System. We were in ARTCC airspace at the time and informed the Controller that we had a hydraulic problem, needed to return to our departure airport, were not declaring an emergency at that time but would do so when entering Approach Control airspace. The Controller issued an initial heading, and then subsequently issued a new clearance directly to an intersection on a STAR to the airport. The Captain called the Lead Flight Attendant to the cockpit and briefed her on our situation, time remaining, etc. I made the PA to the passengers that we had a mechanical issue that required our return to our departure airport. When the Relief Pilot returned the Captain directed him to establish SATCOM communications with Dispatch, Maintenance Control and Airport Operations. In addition he was to contact our departure ATC facility by VHF to let them know of our return, that we would be an emergency, and to request CFR to be standing by. As a result of the loss of the Green Hydraulic System, among a lengthy list of inoperative systems, we would not have nose wheel steering or normal brakes, slats/flaps would be slow to extend and we would have to gravity extend the landing gear. Enroute we reviewed and briefed the QRH procedures for the gravity gear extension including field landing length requirements and approach speed increases; developed a plan for when and how we would configure the aircraft for approach and landing; discussed that the gear doors would be open, and whether they would drag on the runway. We also reviewed and briefed our STAR and expected ILS approach. Finally, we planned to stop on the runway, shut the engines down, and be towed to the passenger terminal. The Captain made a PA explaining that we had a hydraulic problem, that they may hear sounds and noises that they may not be accustom to, the landing would be normal, airport emergency vehicles follow and surround our aircraft, and that we would be towed back to the gate. When in communication with our destination Center we were advised the airport had been informed, and that 'they were ready.' When we switched to Approach Control we declared the emergency and received vectors for the ILS. We extended the gear in accordance with QRH procedures so that we were fully configured prior to glide slope intercept. The landing was smooth, in the touch down zone and rollout was normal as we stopped in the first three quarters of the runway. We shut down the engines, and were shortly thereafter towed to gate. The flight was subsequently canceled. While we were waiting for the hookup and tow I selected the Hydraulic page on the System Display (SD). The Green System showed full and normal quantity. Once at the gate a Mechanic came in and said that the system had been 'over-serviced.'				An A330 returned to its departure airport after receiving a Green Hydraulic System Leak ECAM message.

A few minutes later we were taken off the arrival and given 'proceed direct ARVAD' by Approach Control without any new altitude restriction. I queried Approach Control that we were not given a new altitude when taken off the arrival and he said, 'None was required since ARVAD has 12,000 posted on the STAR.' SHOULD WE NOT HAVE BEEN GIVEN A NEW ALTITUDE CROSSING RESTRICTION SINCE WE WERE TAKEN OFF THE ARRIVAL? Again, when I asked this of ATC they said 'no, as long as ARVAD had an altitude associated with it.' He apparently expected me to cross at 12,000 without being told to do so without any other clarification or communication after being removed from the STAR. We then verified to him that we are now cleared to descent to cross ARVAD at 12,000 FT. All else was normal. I write this in order to receive feed back and clarification for standardization and safety sake.

The Captain continued flying while I began running the ECAM sequence. We quickly deduced that we had lost all quantity in the Green Hydraulic System. After a brief analysis and discussion, we informed Tower that we would be going around. After beginning the go around sequence, we were handed off to Approach Control. The Captain instructed me to declare an emergency and inform ATC that we would like vectors to sort out the issue and accomplish appropriate checklists. We also requested an eventual return to [the long runway]. After completing all procedures, communicating with company and cabin crew, we agreed that we were ready to return for landing and were vectored for a visual approach. We informed Tower that there was a good possibility that we would have to stop on the runway due to no steering capabilities. The Captain flew the approach and landing and we touched down without incident. The Captain was able to steer the aircraft clear of the runway on a high speed taxiway. After stopping the aircraft, we shut down the engines allowing inspection by the emergency/fire personnel. They informed us everything appeared normal, and we waited for the arrival of our tow-in vehicle. We were subsequently towed to the gate without incident.				A320 crew experienced a Green Hydraulic System failure during approach when the landing gear was extended.

We were sequenced behind a [Company aircraft]. I was the Pilot Flying. After liftoff, a course of 092 was followed until 400 FT when LNAV was called for and selected. At approximately this same time, we entered some wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft. We continued to climb out and contacted Departure. Very shortly thereafter, the Departure Controller asked us if we were headed to HRSHL which was the first fix we would turn on the departure (69 degrees). A very hurried glance showed that the LNAV was not engaged and we were still following the heading of 092. The Controller immediately issued vectors and said there was a possibility of an aircraft conflict. We immediately replied we were having FMS issues and he said we should have let him know sooner. Since we were unaware of the problem to begin with, there was no way of being able to advise sooner. We continued to receive vectors on course and advised the Controller the FMC was working properly. After a few minutes we were switched to Center and given a phone number to call upon our arrival. I talked with Atlanta Tower and gave them a description of the problem. He said they were documenting it as an RNAV anomaly and that we would not hear from them again. I do not remember verifying that the LNAV had been engaged because, as the pilot flying, that was the time that we started to encounter the wake turbulence and my attention turned to that. It was a big mistake at a very busy airport. We both needed to be more vigilant.		After takeoff, we encountered wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft. The Captain (pilot flying) called for LNAV. I (pilot not flying) pushed the LNAV button but it failed to engage. The Captain noticed we over flew the first turn (to HRSHL). I started to program the FMS when ATC queried why we were not turning. I inadvertently put GEETK as the first fix thus erasing all the previous fixes. Given the circumstances of the event (gear up, wake turbulence, LNAV button and first turn) there was not much room for error. Fortunately, there was no conflict with any other traffic.		On departure from ATL a B737-700 flight crew encountered wake vortex and then failed to engage LNAV which caused a deviation from the departure track.

The cracking appeared to emanate from the lower left corner of the windscreen and we could also see what appeared to be some splattering of something in that same area.  It sure seemed like a bird strike, but at FL390?  We felt the inside of the window and checked the pressurization and determined that it appeared that it was only the outer pane that was shattered.  Within about 30 seconds of the initial sound, an ECAM message came up stating  that the window heat in that window was INOP.  Out of an abundance of caution, and to avoid some potential icing conditions that we could see between our position and the airport, we elected to declare an emergency and start an early descent.  This also allowed us to both reduce the pressure differential in the cabin as well as slow the aircraft speed.  We then proceeded to destination without further incident.  Upon arrival at the gate, and after making a couple of requested calls to the Tower and the company, I was able to look at the damaged area from the outside.  There appeared to be no other damage to the nose of the aircraft or any other sign of a bird strike, so I now doubt that was the cause.  What the splattered material is at the base of the windscreen, and what caused it to shatter, I do not know.				A320 Captain experiences a shattered right forward windshield at FL390.

On departure we were cleared for departure just after a B737 and just in front of a landing aircraft. We were much heavier and required more ground roll than the preceding aircraft and we ended up hitting their wake turbulence on departure. I realize that traffic is tight in SAN; however both of these incidents were too close for me. It would be better to build in a little more buffer between flights and not push so hard on all of us. This practice is an accident waiting to happen.				A B737-800 Captain expressed concern over aircraft spacing in SAN after experiencing wake turbulence on both arrival and departure.

She informed me that Aft Galley Oven #2 was emitting high temperature from the front, side and top of the unit. I immediately went to the aft galley, where I was greeted by approximately three flight attendants. As I entered the galley area, I could feel radiated heat being emitted from the suspect unit. A Flight Attendant told me that he had notified the cockpit that he had expended a bottle of Halon Fire Extinguishing Agent and advised me that he was preparing to have a second bottle standing-by. He described to me that the oven was getting hotter by the minute and explained that it had not cooled in the same manner as the other ovens in the galley which had been deactivated at the same time. I found the circuit breakers serving the ovens and galley were already pulled. Additionally, the pilots in the cockpit had deactivated the Galley Power Switch located on the cockpit upper panel. There should not have been any electrical current serving the unit. All operational lights and indicators on the operating panel located above the front of the oven were extinguished. The front, top and sides of the oven were hot, allowing tactile contact for only a second. We emptied a shelf-cupboard atop the oven which contained only a few plastic drinking cups. I slowly opened the door of the oven with a dry cloth towel to see if the oven contained a fire. The heat was excessive in relation to previous experiences I've had standing in front of open galley-oven doors aboard the A-330. There was no smoke in the galley area; however the smell of an over-heated electrical kitchen appliance was present. I was able to open the oven door enough to see that the oven was empty and clean. It was undoubtedly producing heat. My experience with ovens convinced me that the heat pouring out of the oven was not simply residual heat from a cooling oven. I secured the door and stepped away from the unit for a minute or two and continued to observe the oven. I called the cockpit to ask the pilots to start thinking about the selection of a diversionary landing at the nearest suitable airport. I began emptying the closet area behind the ovens which serves as a cart storage/baggage area to determine if heat was penetrating the storage area. Although the storage space did not extend all the way back to the suspect oven, I could feel that the inner wall closer to the oven was warmer than the outer wall of the aircraft. I deemed this to be a normal condition after consulting assisting flight attendants who were still present in the aft galley area. We had no control of the oven while excessive heat was continually being produced. I advised the flight attendants that I believe we will not be continuing toward our destination and that it is quite probable that we will be diverting to another airport close by. I asked them to keep me advised of the oven's status via intercom and to keep watch over it. We agreed they would treat it as an electrical fire should the situation escalate. Upon returning to the cockpit, I found both pilots had already begun the investigation of some select airports for a landing. I described the situation to them. We displayed and examined pertinent ECAM electrical pages and found no anomalies. We got a status call from the galley that the oven appeared to be getting hotter. It was at this time that I decided to initiate a diversion. The two nearest airports were both behind us. Constant communication and TEST information was exchanged with the Aft Cabin and Lead Flight Attendant. The Relief Pilot communicated with the company over SATCOM, the First Officer flew the aircraft, I communicated with ATC and the Relief Pilot maintained contact with the cabin, both via intercom and in-person. With four pilots working the situation, clear lines of communication, responsibility and duties made the event entirely manageable, however each of us were still very busy. We contacted ATC, declared an emergency, and turned toward our designated en route alternate, approximately 160 miles behind us. We discussed our overweight situation (at that point, perhaps 80,000 LBS overweight) and agreed on a strategy to get a lower altitude, to slow to gear and flap 1 extension speed, and to use 230 KTS as our new cruise speed toward the alternate in order to exhaust as much fuel as we could to reduce the landing weight. We agreed that if at any point the oven-overheat resulted in the production of flames, we would expedite the arrival by cleaning-up the aircraft to resume a higher speed. After consulting the QRH overweight landing charts it was apparent that the 6,000 FT runway at our planned divert airport was inadequate. The next closest airport was approximately 45 miles farther from our present track, with an 8,000 FT runway. We set course for [the airport with the longer runway] with complete ATC coordination and assistance. We were vectored onto the ILS and landed without incident, taxied clear and parked at a ramp assigned to us by Ground Control with fire trucks escorting us to the ramp. No stairs at the airport seemed to be high enough to afford access to firefighters but somehow they boarded and assured us that the oven, while still very hot, was no longer producing heat. Fire crews were unsuccessful at pulling the oven out of its rack whereupon it was agreed to keep the oven installed, but that it should be continually observed as long as there was electrical power on the aircraft. Fire Fighters kept a log of the oven temperatures long after they boarded. They revealed to us that temperatures of the other three ovens were ambient. Oven number two was still hot an hour after we landed. Despite all efforts, crew was unable to stabilize the escalating temperature of the galley oven. All indications from galley and cockpit revealed that the oven should have been deactivated, yet it continued to generate heat in proportions crew deemed threatening.				A330 Captain is awakened from rest break by the Lead Flight Attendant and informed of an overheating oven in the aft galley. The oven circuit breakers had all been pulled and the galley power had been deactivated in the cockpit and all power indicating lights were extinguished, yet the oven appeared to be getting hotter. The Captain elects to divert to a suitable airport where the fire crew determines that the oven is still hot but cooling and unpowered.

With the Tower/ATC permission we executed a 180 degree turn out of traffic followed by additional vectors while we performed the QRH procedures for this problem. The ultimate requirement of this checklist was to perform a flaps 15 landing at a target approach speed of flaps 15+ 15 KTS. In the interim First Officer declared an emergency with ATC due to our flight control problem and our rapidly diminishing fuel state. It was a clear day and we were only minutes away from possible divert to three large airports. I notified Dispatch via phone patch of our problem and they asked if we could go into our destination at flaps 15. Since I was busy with the QRH completion I asked them to send us the data via ACARS. It arrived just in time, because we were now approaching a minimum fuel status and I was just about to divert. The data was good with auto breaks set at 3/ flaps 15, so we continued to a successful/uneventful landing at our destination. Our gross weight at touchdown was about 111k, hence our ability to have the performance necessary for a flaps 15 landing. Emergency response vehicles followed us off the runway until we terminated our emergency status.The cause of the annunciation we had was a #6 slat in transit light on the overhead panel. This precipitated the forward panel annunciation and our airspeed tape lower buffer margin readouts (yellow band) thinking the aircraft did not have proper flap configuration. The top of the band was 20 KTS above flaps 40 target speed. This ended up being a #6 slat sensor problem rather than the slat actually being out of position, but the results were the same.				B737-700 Captain experiences a LE Slat in transit light during approach. QRH procedures are complied with resulting in a flaps 15 landing. Dispatch is asked to do the performance calculations for landing on the relatively short runway with flaps 15 and finds the runway adequate.

Prior to departure, the Captain related to the First Officer a conversation he just had via phone at the departure gate with the Chief Pilot. The Chief inquired as to what was going on with the broken airplane and specifically if the First Officer [me] was reporting 'bogus' and invalid write ups. Captain stated that all write ups were valid, reviewed and personally verified by him. On approach to landing, flaps remained at 2 degrees after being commanded past 2 degrees.

Pilot monitoring noted that the LE FLAPS TRANSIT light remained illuminated and the trailing edge flaps had stopped between the up and flaps 1 position (flap handle was in the flaps 1 detent). Captain coordinated vectors with approach to sort out the problem. After recognizing that we had a trailing edge flaps disagree abnormal, we declared an emergency with ATC and opted to divert to [a longer runway]. Dispatch was notified via ACARS, and a call was made to operations. Captain coordinated with the flight attendants, and made a PA to our passengers. The QRH Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree abnormal procedure was completed (alternate flap extension) and we took vectors for an uneventful landing. Landed flaps 15 per the QRH, made a logbook entry, and debriefed Maintenance personnel at the gate.		On approach, flaps jammed prior to reaching the 1 position. After verifying condition we asked ATC for vectors to evaluate issue. During initial review of QRH condition it became apparent we would not be able to fully deploy the flaps and would be unable to land at destination. We declared an emergency with ATC and asked for continued vectors to troubleshoot and configure aircraft for landing at ZZZ. Deployed flaps via the alternate system to 15 and landed without issue. First Officer did a superlative job as pilot flying. He coordinated with ATC, prepared for approach, and provided helpful analysis with a rather complex QRH procedure.		B737-800 flight crew experiences a flap anomaly during approach and after complying with QRH procedures elects to divert to an airport with a longer runway.

Had traffic, A319, called in the descent for 28R. Traffic went below cloud deck so he was not in sight. Controller stepped us down until below the cloud deck. Had traffic in sight. As we came down to capture the glide path from above we caught up with the A319. We were LOC capture on 28L. We were dead abeam with the A319 and he was CLOSE! I do not know if he overshot 28R center line or not. I decided too close for me and as I went for the TOGA, the TCAS RA 'Climb Climb Climb.' We executed a normal go around. Went around for left downwind and made a normal approach and landing on 28R. The passengers on the right side of the aircraft were grateful, as they saw the whole thing quite clearly. Suggestions, SFO operates on the edge of safety with simultaneous double parallel and intersecting runways operations (28L/R for landing and 1R/L for take-off) I am quite surprised that it is authorized to operate TCAS in the TA only mode (note on 10-7 page). Having had friends killed after silencing a safety system, I would never operate in TA only mode. In the future, I will be sure to have longitudinal separation of any parallel traffic. A kudos to the training department on the debrief with the FO, I asked him if I did the go around correctly. He said it was textbook. It all happened so fast, we just did it and I didn't remember. Relaxed and controlled.				SFO Air Carrier landing Runway 28L experienced a TCAS RA with traffic on the parallel runway and executed a go around.

ATC had slowed us to 160 KTS approximately 10 miles from the runway to keep our spacing from the B767. Inbound from the San Mateo Bridge, we slowed to our final approach speed (approximately 130 KIAS), and we were on the localizer and glide slope. We were fully stabilized approximately 1,300 feet AGL, due to our slow speed crossing the outer marker. A B737 was approaching behind us on the Quiet Bridge visual approach to the parallel 28R. It is intended that aircraft stay staggered on these close parallel approaches. When we were around 1,000 feet AGL we got a TCAS Resolution Advisory which said 'descend', and displayed command bars. I followed the command bars while my First Officer looked for the aircraft. He immediately saw it, and said it appeared he was going around. I was slightly below the glide slope and began to correct, now that we had the intruding aircraft visually. I also moved slightly left of my localizer to increase lateral separation. Then that aircraft lowered his nose rapidly to recapture his glide slope at which point he overtook us rapidly. I just made sure we maintained lateral separation while he passed us. He touched down well in front of us on the parallel Runway 28R. We landed normally on 28L. I have never had another aircraft overtake and pass me on this or any other close parallel approach. It was shocking to say the least. Any passengers looking out the window must have been stunned to see how close the other aircraft was to us. I can't control what other aircraft are going to do in any given situation. In this case I cannot go-around with a descend command from TCAS. Even when we had him visually going around would have been more dangerous in terms of collision. Any lateral movement during the go-around procedure could have been disastrous.  I felt it best to just maintain position and let him pass us. Once he was clear, we were still well within the parameters of a stabilized approach, so we continued for a normal landing.				Air carrier landing SFO during side by visual approaches to Runway 28L/R described a passing event, expressing concern regarding the procedure.

A heavy had just landed and was rolling out long and we were taking our position on the runway as cleared. Additionally, there was an inbound aircraft on an approximately 4 mile final at this time, and it was obvious the Controller was attempting to speed our departure along in an effort to prevent a go-around by the inbound aircraft. Next, the Controller issued departure instructions to us while we were in position, which we believe included a heading and something regarding contacting Departure Control. Unfortunately, the aforementioned instructions were very hurried, mumbled and quite ambiguous. Both the Captain and I were unsure of what the Tower Controller had just said; although we were certain no takeoff clearance had been issued. The landing aircraft was still on the runway. The Captain, who was the pilot not flying, queried the Controller on the aforementioned instructions. In fact, the instructions were so vague and confusing that we asked the Tower Controller if he wanted us to contact Departure at that time while we were in position. No reply was received, instead several seconds later we were cleared for takeoff as the heavy aircraft was exiting the runway. During the initial climb out, the Captain again asked the Controller to verify the heading at 250 degrees and the response we received was '150' with no turn direction included. As a result, he turned the heading indicator to 150 and we initiated a turn to the right, absent any directional instructions. We turned right since this was the shortest direction to that heading (runway heading 335). We were approximately 30 degrees into the turn and approaching acceleration altitude when the Captain asked the Tower Controller to switch to Departure frequency. The response from the Tower was to inform us the 150 degrees heading was to be a left turn. As a result, we immediately initiated a turn direction back to the left. Shortly thereafter we contacted Departure Control. We received no traffic alerts and nothing extraordinary was said on the Departure frequency regarding our initial turn to the right. The flight continued to our destination without incident. ATC Controller should issue clear, appropriate departure instructions at the appropriate time. Flight crew should not begin takeoff roll without being 100% certain of departure instructions, regardless of proximity of inbound aircraft.				An Air Carrier issued a hurried takeoff clearance from BWI was not given a clear departure vector heading and after a takeoff track deviation were given a new heading by the TRACON.

We were put 2.5 miles behind a 747-400 who was on the ILS 28L. The winds below 4,000 FT were 180 at 15 KTS and surface winds were 250 at 10 KTS. I asked to slow due to the 747's close proximity on the approach given the southerly winds that would blow the 747's wake into our path. The Controller seemed upset that we were concerned about the possible wake encounter and said that we could go missed if we had a problem. We broke out at 1,700 FT and stayed high and flew over the wake that we could clearly see due to the moisture in the air! My issue is with the Controller not having any situational awareness in regards to the 747 and the winds aloft considering the close proximity of the aircraft and these dangerous approaches. Smaller aircraft should be still given 5 miles behind a heavy on this approach considering how close the 2 runways are (750 FT)! This is an accident waiting to happen!				A320 pilot reported he was upset with SFO Controller's technique in not providing enough margin to a preceding B747 wake turbulence.

After 10,000 FT the flight attendants called and said they were experiencing a very strong odor that was causing breathing problems and eye discomfort especially in the aft cabin. We donned our oxygen masks and immediately the Flight Attendant called back reported that one flight attendant had been involved in a previous situation with the same smell. At this time I elected to return to the departure airport. We proceeded with our checklist and returned for an overweight landing. The flight attendants said that unless we had not returned we would have had a lot of sick people. I asked for medical staff to meet the aircraft to check our flight attendants and any passengers that may require assistance. I do not know how to prevent this from reoccurring as this is an ongoing problem. I do have some comments as to issues we had dealing with this situation. 1- We had a lot of trouble with our oxygen masks. We all had trouble with the mask hitting our reading glasses. I tried taking mine off but this did not work as I did need them. My mask had smudges on the shield which made reading checklists and seeing the PFD very hard. During landing I had to remove my mask so I could see to land. Not good if heavy smoke had been present. 2- Communication with ATC, Flight Attendant, [and] Dispatch was very hard. We were confused by the toggle switch that is used for talking while using the masks. This took several minutes before we correctly used the switch. Having to turn your head to find the switch did not help. Boeing's switch on the yoke is better in that looking for switch is not required. 3- When using the oxygen mask all communication comes over the cockpit speakers. This made it very hard to hear. At times ATC was blocked by other communications with flight attendants and Dispatch. We found the only way to deal with this was to don our headsets over our masks. We adapted but this took time and caused confusion. 4- I feel we need more training using the oxygen masks. The simulator scenarios we have previously used did not simulate all the calls from ATC, flight attendants, and Dispatch simultaneously. It is very hard to create a scenario in the simulator with real life confusion. Communication was the biggest problem!	The Reporter stated that the oil leak was serious enough that the pilots were feeling physical effects exhibited as a tight feeling throat. He was unable to describe the odor except to say it was like no other odor he has experience before. It was not the typical dirty socks smell but none the less, very distinctive. He was told by a Mechanic several days later that the aircraft was test flown and grounded by test pilots for the same odor which forced a maintenance examination of the aircraft where the worn engine bearing was found.			An A330 returned to the departure airport after the pilots and flight attendants detected a strange odor. Maintenance determined that oil leaking around a worn engine bearing was entering the compressor section and then the air conditioning. The flight crew had great difficulty with ATC and other communications because of the oxygen masks.

Passing GRAMM we still had not been handed off to SoCal Approach. Approaching RUSTT we were handed off to Approach and cleared for RIIVR2 Arrival and ILS 24R approach. This left us high and briefed for the wrong runway. Because we would not be able to satisfy RIIVR crossing restriction, we requested and received relief. While setting up and briefing ILS 24R we passed RIIVR and realized we were navigating to LUVYN still on the ILS 25L approach track. We had insufficient time to enter the ILS 24R procedure in to the FMS and complete the approach briefing for the new runway prior to the IAF due to the late ATC clearance. We requested and received a heading to intercept the ILS 24R approach and were then cleared for the approach. The approach and landing were uneventful. Approach Control did not advise of any loss of separation.		Light traffic into LAX, so ATC allowed us to keep our speed up but then they seemed behind the ball on issuing clearances. We were issued step-down descent clearances initially and were told to expect GRAMM at FL180. I was already in the [mental] 'get the plane down to VNAV PATH' mode. I normally brief my non-flying partner that 'if we get a different runway, you do the FMS while I make sure we comply with altitude, speed and course,' but I did not say that this time. I was still in altitude-chasing mode when the CA noticed we hadn't changed the FMS to 24R.  There was no time to re-brief the new approach and I failed to change the FMS or ask the CA to do it.Stop issuing late runway changes at LAX. This is something that happens over and over. 90% of the time there is plenty of time to make the changes, but 10% of the time it's one of those 'where are we going' moments.		Late descent clearances and an unexpected runway change inbound to LAX on the RIIVR2 STAR overtaxed the flight crew of a B737-800 and required Approach Control vectors while the newly assigned ILS was programmed and activated.

The First Officer loaded new route and I verified the new route was loaded correctly. After departure, flight was given direct LAS. The First Officer inserted direct LAS, which I verified, and engaged with 'abeam points'. The First Officer loaded en route winds into flight plan. During loading, the First Officer remembers seeing the route with J100 from LAS to SNY while loading BCE winds. Shortly after passing LAS, Center asked if we were on J100. We responded we were supposed to be and checked the FMGC route. The route now showed LAS direct to SNY with no 'abeam points'. We corrected it and got back on course. We do not know how the route got changed. Less than two minutes later, the same thing happened to another air carrier flight behind us. The most likely explanation would be that one of us mistakenly inputted a 'direct SNY'. However, the First Officer's technique would be to program such a change including 'abeam pts'. They were not there. The First Officer does not remember making that input and I did not verify any such input. This makes that mistaken input somewhat less likely. I did not make any inputs. We are at a loss to explain what actually happened. Since the same thing happened to the next flight, at the same point, on the same route, on the same day, at almost the same time, there is a small possibility that there is a database or other FMGC glitch. This is worthy of further investigation.				An A320 flight crew received a reroute clearance prior to takeoff and programmed the FMGC accordingly. Inexplicably, after takeoff when ATC inquired as to their deviation from that route they found the programmed 'airways' route between LAS and SNY had vanished and was now showing a 'direct' route. Strangely enough, another air carrier A320 flight crew flying the same route shortly behind them reported what appeared to be an identical anomaly.

[We] briefed on ground during departure briefing. [We] used Level Change 250 on MCP until 11,000 FT MSL to avoid VNAV exceeding 250-KT restriction. [We] encountered wake turbulence from preceding aircraft while on departure climb vectors from Center around 10,000 FT MSL. On climb from 11,000 FT to 12,000 FT announced and selected VNAV, which accelerated climb speed to 270 KIAS. A few minutes later, ATC asked if we were at 250 KTS. We replied, 'Slowing.' TCAS distance from the preceding aircraft was in excess of five miles and the Controller never mentioned a possible deviation. We were assigned FL230 and normal speed leaving 14,000 FT.I simply forgot the speed restriction since it had been so long before that we briefed it due to ground congestion leading to departure delays. Additionally, numerous altitude assignments, heading changes, and frequency changes departing MDW made for a very busy departure. Furthermore, we encountered wake turbulence around 10,000 FT MSL, which added another threat to the departure. I announced the change of speed profile (VNAV), but the pilot not flying didn't challenge my mistake. It might be prudent in the future to change the Econ VNAV speed to the SID assignment of 250 KIAS in case the assignment is forgotten. Also, it would be helpful if the pilot not flying checked in on each new frequency above 10,000 FT MSL with the speed restriction just to serve as a reminder to the flight crew as well as ATC.		The wake turbulence incident switched our attention from airspeed control to position of the wake turbulence aircraft. We should have paid closer attention to airspeed and MCP selection during the evolution.		B737-700 flight crew departing MDW reported exceeding charted 250 KT restriction in part because of distraction from wake vortex encounter.

Captain called for QRH and stated that he had the aircraft and the ATC communications. I worked checklist while Captain advised ATC that we were working a problem. Captain advised ATC that he wanted to return and requested ARF standby. I worked checklists and was able to determine that the reason the gear did not come up was most likely the manual gear access door not contacting switch under door. On preflight the door appeared closed. Landed uneventfully, cleared runway and taxied back to gate. At gate Captain wrote up incident in logbook and called Dispatch to advise. Also debriefed Maintenance Representative after maintenance action was complete and logbook signed off we were dispatched without incident.Manual gear access door appeared to have dirt and grime which seemed to foul the latch. I could pop the door open with my finger nails even though it appeared fully closed. Flight Manual calls to check door closed on preflight. I checked door and it appeared closed. There is no way that I know to check if the switch under the access door is depressed until you raise the gear handle and find out your hydraulics have been deactivated due to the door not being fully seated. I don't know what the maintenance cycle is on this door or the switch but it should be routinely cleaned and lubricated to prevent future incidents of this nature.		Gear failed to retract after take off. First Officer worked the QRH, initially to no availability. The First Officer noticed that the manual gear extension door would not seat properly as directed by the QRH. As he worked the door, it finally seated and the gear retracted. I had all ready informed ATC that we would be returning. We returned where Maintenance lubed and removed debris from the manual gear extension door area. As a precaution, an emergency was declared and rescue team was requested, [we] landed uneventfully. Spilled liquid and crumbs accumulate in and around the manual gear extension door making it difficult operate the door. Regular periodic maintenance to clean the finger grab and door area would prevent this from being an issue.		B737-800 flight crew reports failure of the landing gear to retract after takeoff. During QRH procedures it is determined that the manual gear extension door is not seated properly and not contacting the switch below. The gear retracts when the door is properly seated but the crew elects to return for maintenance.

The Captain again applied the QRH procedure while I flew the airplane and talked with ATC. I requested a level off at 8,000 FT and informed them of the possibility of a return to the departure airport. The decision was made to return and we landed without incident. As we taxied in, I contacted Operations and they assigned us a gate and requested we contact Dispatch since they were unaware of our return. Since I was flying and monitoring ATC, I did not hear all the coordinating the Captain did. I assumed Dispatch was contacted since an emergency was not declared. I feel as a Crew, we handled the situation well.				B737-700 First Officer experiences a pressurization controller failure on the takeoff roll. Climbing through 6,000 FT the alternate pressurization controller fails and cabin altitude is noted below sea level. Crew elects to return to departure airport.

At least six other air carriers reported the same. ATC explained that military operations in the area were responsible. We never recovered GPS data but were able to continue normally as both IRS platforms were tight and FMS position keeping was steady. Checked NOTAMs and saw nothing about military exercises that could affect GPS signals. Our GPS system never returned. It was completely shut off. The only subsystem that was affected was the terrain database that stopped functioning when the GPS signal was lost. Whatever hit us and the other aircraft in the area was very powerful and serves to illustrate how vulnerable our type of GPS system is to interference. I'm sure these military exercises were classified but the Department Of Defense (DOD) needs to be careful with whatever they were doing, especially if the weather in the area is bad. The FAA needs to consult with DOD on this matter because it affected so many aircraft at once.				B737 Captain reports loss of all GPS information during descent into ELP and indicated that other aircraft were affected also. ATC explained that military operations in the area were responsible.

As per MEL, we could fly with one GPS inoperative. We also had MAP display failures on both pilot displays. Numerous calls were made to Maintenance Control, Dispatch and Maintenance to find out if the MAP malfunction was a result of the GPS being placarded inoperative. There was never a consensus on why there was a MAP display malfunction. Without Maintenance ever arriving at the aircraft the MAP function on both displays started working. Again we called Dispatch and Maintenance and concluded that we were good to takeoff. On takeoff both flight directors disappeared. We turned the flight director switches off and then on and were able to regain our flight directors. The First Officer was unable to engage the autopilot on either side and was having to hand-fly the aircraft. Passing thru 15,000 FT, we noticed a smell in the cockpit like something was burning. At the same time the flight attendants called up that they smelled something like it was burning. (They had not turned on the ovens or the coffee makers when we got the smell). Not knowing where the smell was coming from we decided to declare an emergency and return to the airport. We accomplished the 'Smoke, Fire or Fumes' QRH checklist. The flight attendants turned off the power ports and wifi and immediately searched the cabin to look for what might be causing the smell. The smell subsided as rapidly as it came without any indication of where it came from. During the return to the airport the First Officer was getting what we determined to be unreliable inputs from the flight directors. Because of declaring an emergency we requested that ARFF trucks meet us on landing and check us over before taxiing. The landing was an uneventful normal landing. Excellent job by all crewmembers and should be commended for their expertise and job well done. Crew coordination between the cabin crew and flight crew was outstanding.		[Narrative 2 contained no additional information.]		A B737-800 with the right GPS inoperative during preflight then had both MAP displays indicate failed. Unable to get maintenance and after the MAPs returned to normal, the flight departed only to declare an emergency and return to land because of an electrical burning smell.

We had already passed ZZZZZ1, which is the first fix on the ZZZZZ TWO and has a crossing restriction of FL230. The next fix is ZZZZZ2 which has a crossing restriction of FL220. We were between ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ2 at FL220 and selected 6,000 for the south transition and started a managed descent.I was anticipating the FMS would have a constraint of 220 until ZZZZZ2 but the FMS started descending before ZZZZZ2. We were both discussing the ZZZZZ  charting and we noticed the descent at about FL212 at which point we climbed back up to 220 just about the time that we crossed ZZZZZ2. Center reported no traffic conflicts but did provide a landline number to call which the Captain did after landing. He also spoke with Approach.Both the Captain and I have been on the Airbus for many years so we are well familiar with the aircraft's systems and behaviors. Neither of us can figure out why there wasn't a constraint at ZZZZZ2 for FL220. Perhaps it was because we 'cleared via' the ZZZZZ TWO while at a cruise altitude 'below' the initial [restricted] fix (ZZZZZ1)? Neither of us could recall starting a 'Descend Via' STAR at such a low altitude before so perhaps that is an issue with the FMS. If it can be determined that the FMS cannot accept starting a 'Descend Via' STAR at an altitude below the initial one then there needs to be a software modification to allow it to do so or Airbus pilots will have to manually perform the descent.		I selected 6,000 FT for the lowest altitude on the arrival and selected managed descent past ZZZZZ1 and prior to ZZZZZ2 Intersections.Upon reverifying the altitude constraints it was noted that that ZZZZZ2 constraint of FL220 had been deleted.		The flight crew of an A320 was cleared via the ZZZZZ RNAV STAR while in cruise flight at a Flight Level (FL220) below that of the initial altitude restriction on the STAR (FL230). When Managed Descent was engaged the FMGC initiated a descent from FL220 despite not yet crossing the next waypoint, which requires crossing at FL220. When advised by ATC the crew noted that the FL220 restriction had not been processed by the FMGC.

Accomplished BLEED TRIP checklist and BLEED TRIP reset (light extinguished).   Continued climb to destination discussing with First Officer further actions.  Contacted Maintenance Control for any further info.  This flight departure was delayed 3 hours to Maintenance replacing number two PRSOV after the previous flight came in with a BLEED TRIP light (number two) above FL 350 maintenance writeup.  Since we were flight planned at FL400 and left with slightly more fuel than minimum required for trip, I considered a lower altitude (FL330 or 320) to complete trip and wanted to make sure we had enough fuel for the lower altitude, consulting with Dispatch.  Climbing through FL180, the BLEED TRIP illuminated again.  I elected not to try another reset, referred again to the checklist which then required to shut off the associated air conditioning pack (right side).  The end of the checklist for that flow indicated 'Avoid icing conditions.'   About that time we entered a thick overcast at about FL240 with temperatures at negative 30 degrees.   Given the note, inflight conditions, lack of an air conditioning pack and limited fuel state, I elected to return to the departure airport.  Notified Operations and Dispatch I was returning to departure airport. A malfunction somewhere in the bleed system or sensing system, unknown by me at this writing.				A B737-700 number two engine bleed, which tripped on takeoff, was reset during climb but tripped again as the aircraft entered possible icing so the flight returned to the departure airport for the second BLEED trip maintenance of the day.

At the same time, we were given directions from Departure Control. Plane rolled right and then left winding up in 30-degree left bank. Autopilot remained engaged as did LNAV and VNAV, but the plane continued turning left. Departure Control's instruction was, 'Delete the altitude at ROPPR but maintain current speed.' I had to ask for a retransmit due to radio congestion. We were in a left turn and were probably about 30 degrees left of a heading that would have taken us to ROPPR, the next SID fix. Began the correction at which time Departure Control queried whether we were proceeding to ROPPR, They said, 'Appeared you turned early.' I confirmed our clearance and that we were proceeding to ROPPR. Five to ten seconds later, he asked if we had traffic (arrival traffic) at '10 o'clock, 1,000 high'. I responded affirmatively and he came back with, 'Proceed on course, maintain visual on the traffic.' I responded and we continued toward ROPPR turning short of it so as to proceed as quickly as possible to the SID course's next fix of CESAR. No further problems and no TCAS alerts. Note; Autopilot and LNAV/VNAV remained engaged but the aircraft did not correct to course, almost as if it went to CWS. [I] discussed at length with First Officer after reaching altitude. Perhaps a more aggressive correction to course but that's obvious. We just got set up with the simultaneous radio call/congestion and the turbulence induced heading change/automation error which neither of us caught quickly enough to avoid the course deviation to the extent that it occurred. [We] should have disengaged autopilot sooner than we did. It just appeared that the auto pilot was correcting or was set up to do so but did not come back to course.

The Number 1 engine instruments immediately indicated an engine failure. At the time, the First Officer was flying the aircraft and did an excellent job continuing to fly the aircraft while I accomplished the checklist items. First, the boxed items for the Engine Fire/Severe Damage/Separation/Seizure Checklist was accomplished from memory because of the loud bang that occurred and the vibration that initially occurred. After the engine was shut down and while reviewing the checklist, I realized that we had an engine failure instead of the Engine Fire/Severe Damage/Separation/Seizure condition. I then accomplished the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist. Step 9 states to evaluate an engine restart attempt. We had good RPM on the Number 1 and Number 2 RPM gages, so we elected to attempt a crossbleed start. The In-flight Engine Start Checklist was then accomplished. The engine did not start after 30 seconds so the start was aborted and no further attempt was made to start the engine. At that point, the One Engine Inoperative Checklist was accomplished. The First Officer then transferred control of the aircraft to me and I accomplished the single engine landing.		Suddenly, approximately 12 miles from the airport, we heard a very loud bang and experienced a moderate roll to the left. After establishing firm control of the aircraft, as the pilot flying, I ask the Captain what he saw as the problem. We then received vectors for the ILS. It was not the longest runway but, with strong winds out of the north and very good landing margins, we felt secure in using it. The flight attendants were kept in the loop by the Captain during the whole event and did a very good job in reassuring the passengers that everything was going to be fine. Landing was an overweight, but the touchdown was extremely smooth with almost no sink at touchdown. Upon completion of a short landing roll, we called off the emergency personnel and taxied to the gate uneventfully.		A B737-700's left engine failed during climbout with a loud bang, so an emergency was declared, the Checklist completed and the flight returned to land overweight.

I insisted that they provide a manual count with accurate Souls On Board (SOB) count. (I explained that in case of an emergency, ATC will need an accurate SOB count. This becomes important later!) In cruise, Master Caution illuminated with HYD on '6 pack.' Verified Number 2 Engine driven hydraulic pump illuminated and zero fluid quantity in System B. Made decision to run QRH, declare emergency and divert to alternate airport. Captain was pilot not flying and performed QRH. He started running the loss of all hydraulics checklist and exacerbated problems. Autopilot failed as a result increasing my workload and I fortunately stopped him from completing wrong checklist. He started performing correct checklist while I flew aircraft, pulled up the divert airport ATIS, sent ACARS message to Maintenance and Dispatch and setup FMC for diversion. Once emergency was declared we were given priority handling and given vectors direct. I advised Captain we should advise ATC we needed longest available runway. Captain was not assertive when communicating with ATC. I advised Captain that I would like to configure aircraft early. Upon selection of Flaps 1, System B Electric Pump failed due to low quality at stand pipe. We requested radar vectors off of localizer to perform manual flap extension checklist. Captain performed checklist. I requested that he not go beyond flaps 10 until we lowered the gear in order to prevent gear warning horn 35 miles out. He manually extended flaps beyond 10 and gear horn began continuously. I called gear down flaps 15 Landing Checklist and somewhere between flaps 10 and 15, the Captain decided he wanted to land the aircraft. This left me to complete the checklist with no idea of where he left off or time to review what had been done up until that point. Even though I had been hand flying the aircraft for the preceding 30 minutes, a transfer of control took place. Pilot induced oscillations and dutch roll were extreme, but a safe landing was made. We taxied to the gate with emergency aircraft following and terminated the flight.				A B737-800 Master Caution Light and Master Warning HYD illuminated in cruise with the System B quantity indicating zero so the QRH was completed, an emergency declared and the flight diverted. CRM and crew coordination issues developed on final.

He was able to reach a Controller on 121.5, however when instructed to contact ATC on another frequency, we received nothing. After continuous effort for several minutes to reach ATC, our ECAM messages cleared and our radios were normal for the duration of the flight. The QRH assumes there will only be one radio inoperative. My suggestion would be to make a note in the QRH regarding the transponder procedure if there happens to be a total loss of communication. It would also be nice to have a reference page for the lost comm procedure that is found in the Flight Operations Manual.				A320 Captain experiences lost communication on departure due to a stuck mic that is annunciated by ECAM as 'VHF1 EMITTING'. The problem transfers to VHF2 when that radio is selected and eventually clears on its' own.

The Pilot Monitoring secured the PTU and the engine pump as per ECAM, but the System Display indicated a total loss of fluid. We continued climb out to cruise. We discussed the problem with Dispatch and Maintenance Control, during which we decided to divert to a nearby airport. An emergency was declared. We selected the diversion airport based on its long runway, good weather, pilot familiarity, excellent facilities, and available Company Maintenance. We debated whether an overweight landing should be accomplished, but considered doing so prudent and the safest course of action. We configured early and had to use the landing gear gravity extension procedure. The overweight landing at 154,000 pounds was uneventful. We stopped straight ahead on the runway and were towed to the gate. A deadheading pilot, who was invited to the flight deck for the remainder of the flight for possible additional input, reported loud squealing sounds on takeoff during gear and flap retraction. The passengers and cabin crew were briefed several times en route to our diversion airport.				After suffering a Green Hydraulic System failure after gear and flap retraction the flight crew of an Airbus, after consultation with Dispatch and Maintenance, elected to divert to a nearby airport where an emergency was declared and an uneventful overweight landing resulted.

We felt a 'mushy' yaw/roll/pitch change followed by a more pronounced yaw in the opposite direction. I noticed the number one engine had rolled back significantly to the mid 60% range. I assumed the number one engine had failed and disconnected the autothrottle and autopilot. I retarded the number one throttle toward idle and the engine appeared to stabilize. When the engine stabilized, no further abnormal indications were noted. The flight attendants reported hearing a 'pop' just before the event. We ran all checklists and returned to the departure airport. We elected to use flaps 15 for the landing. The remainder of the flight was uneventful. Upon shutdown, a red box appeared around the digital readout of the number one engine N1 indicating an exceedence. Dispatch, Maintenance, and the Chief Pilot were notified. A logbook entry was made.				A B737-700 engine rolled back in flight then stabilized, but after that the flight attendants reported a pop. The flight returned to the departure airport where engine instruments indicated an N1 exceedence.

We cleared the runway and were told by ATC, 'Sorry , there was a false indication of a runway incursion.' We contacted the Company and Maintenance for further assistance.  The runway incursion system should be fixed.

Three attempts were made to close the discontinuity before it closed. We remained on the LNAV course throughout departure. Preflight route/departure briefing verified all correct points for procedure, and no discontinuities existed. There is a Safety Alert in our chart manuals, along with a note on the cover page of the trip weather package, drawing attention to route discontinuities occurring from Runways 15R and 22L/R between points BRRRO and CHWDH and a warning to not accept these procedures with a discontinuity. The purpose of this report is to alert Flight Operations that this anomaly is occurring on other runways not included in the Safety Alert or weather package cover note. Dispatch was contacted once we got to cruise altitude to pass this information along to flight crews departing BOS. My Chief Pilot and Union Safety Representative were also given a courtesy call to inform them of the issue.I believe the company should suspend RNAV departures out of BOS until the cause for these discontinuities is discovered.		This problem is not runway specific, as it happened to us as well on Runway 4R. We attempted to close the discontinuity three times to no avail. The aircraft would no longer fly the route and eventually entered bypass on the fix in question.		The flight crew of a B737-700 encountered an unexpected route discontinuity between BUOYY and BSQUE on the line selected BLZZR RNAV SID off Runway 4R at BOS.

Good crew rest, briefs, and all pre-departure items normal. Passing 13,000 FT at approximately 290 KTS with autothrottles/autopilot, LNAV, and VNAV, aircraft experienced three bangs/pops with noticeable associated yaws. Captain (PF) disengaged autothrottles/autopilot and established level flight. First Officer (PM) noted more noise from Number 2 which sounded like metal in a blender. Number 2 had pegged out EGT with complete red dial, but other engine indications were similar to Number 1. Captain and First Officer agreed to apply memory items for engine limit. Autothrottles were already disengaged so Captain guarded Number 1 and First Officer reduced/closed Number 2. Engine still had thrust with no aircraft vibrations, but crew agreed indications from the bangs and metal noise were not normal, and decided to shut the engine down. Captain guarded Number 1 and First Officer cut off Number 2. First Officer declared emergency and requested vectors for immediate landing while Captain continued flying. ATC did a nice job giving a base turn and pilot discretion descent to runway and giving time to get souls on board and fuel. First Officer ran clean up checklists while coordinating with ATC while Captain let flight attendants know we had the engine secured and were returning so they should secure the cabin. Crew had completed Engine Limit/Surge/Stall memory items and since engine was shut down ran the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist. After completing that, we ran the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist. Crew noted the landing would not be overweight and calculated landing speeds to use flap 15 speeds and programmed FMC. ATC changed runway's so First Officer setup FMC and navaids appropriately while Captain got plane down on profile. ATC switched to unified Tower frequency with Fire Chief monitoring, which was helpful to coordinate their inspection of the aircraft after an uneventful southeast landing with autobrake 2. While Captain coordinated with Fire Chief, First Officer briefed passengers and flight attendants about engine problem and safe landing, why the fire trucks were inspecting, and finally that all was well so we were returning to the gate. First Officer called Operations to coordinate gate and CSR for transfers while Captain coordinated with ATC for taxi since cleared by Fire Chief. Passengers seemed fine, Flight Attendant Supervisor, Captain and Assistant Chief Pilot checked with flight attendants to make sure they were okay (which they determined they were) and returned to their Base. Maintenance notified Crew Number 2 engine turbine blades were toast. In hindsight knowing the extent of the damage, we might have followed the Engine Fire/Severe Damage/Separation Checklist, but other than the three pops/bangs we did not have excessive aircraft vibrations and other engine indicators were about the same other than high EGT, which went in limits once the throttle was closed. This would have resulted in pulling the fire handle, and maximizing SE GA thrust as opposed to our path, which we determined we did not need it given our light weight in the One Engine Inoperative Checklist.		During climb out at approximately 13,000 FT and 290 KTS, the aircraft experienced three very loud pops/bangs accompanied by noticeable yaw. The aircraft was in LNAV/VNAV with the autothrottles on. A quick look at the engine instruments showed the Number 2 EGT basically totally highlighted in red. The autopilot and autothrottles were disconnected and after a discussion we decided to shutdown the engine. After reducing the power to idle, the engine appeared to be producing some power but due to the severity of the initial pops/bangs we decided to continue with the shutdown and positioned the start lever to cutoff.We declared an emergency and requested vectors back for landing. We contacted our flight attendants and quickly explained we were returning to the field and instructed them to secure the cabin. The Engine Failure Shutdown Checklist as well as the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist were accomplished and followed by an uneventful landing. ATC was very helpful and, although a couple of runway changes occurred, they rendered all assistance possible. At some point on final, we were assigned a 'common' ATC/emergency vehicle frequency, which proved beneficial. Upon exiting the runway, we had direct communication with rescue crews who confirmed that to all appearances the Number 2 engine looked normal showing no visible signs of damage or leakage.Things happened so rapidly it was not until this time we were able to make a PA to our passengers and give a brief explanation of what had happened. Armed with the information from the emergency crews, we decided to taxi to the gate where assistance was provided for both passengers and crew. I'd just like to say that the crew was fantastic. The training we've received paid off. The First Officer and I were on the same page all throughout and not until later in the day while Monday morning second guessing ourselves did we decide that we could have done some things differently (perhaps running the Engine Severe Damage Checklist). But, with the information available at the time we are still confident we acted prudently. The Flight Operations support to us was more than adequate encouraging us to not continue our pairing if not 100% ready.		B737-700 flight crew experiences an engine failure during climb out indicated by banging and high EGT. The engine is shut down and the flight returns to the departure airport.

Upon examination, it appeared that the outer panel was primarily affected. While I don't believe that anything struck the airplane, however, the place from where the cracks emanated looked like a bullet impact and was located right where the electrical lead attached to the power source for the window heat. There was no loss of pressurization. While the load bearing panel of the windscreen appeared to be intact, Dispatch was contacted and the we expressed our concern that we felt the aircraft had become un-airworthy and we reached a unanimous consensus with Dispatch that a return to our departure airport would be the most prudent action. The QRH actually guides the crew to continue normal operations if no differential restrictions apply. I will tell you this went counter to some common sense perspectives both the First Officer and I discussed. To our reasoning, there was no question that once the aircraft was on the ground, it would be considered un-airworthy and the damage not covered by an MEL. Furthermore, it just went counter to common sense to climb from FL230 to FL390 staring at a cracked and broken windscreen even though, from an engineering point of view, that may have been possible. Furthermore, if we felt the aircraft was in any way un-airworthy, continuing for another hour to a destination made no sense since we were 15 minutes away from a major Maintenance and pilot base. I also had some concerns as to what had caused the explosive force that had cracked the windscreen and did not feel comfortable not understanding why it happened. We relayed our thoughts to our Dispatcher who concurred. With the three of us on the same page, we elected to be more cautious than the QRH and divert to the nearest suitable airport which was our departure airport. We returned uneventfully, entered the discrepancy into the logbook, spoke with Dispatch, and were transferred to another aircraft. The passengers were all transferred to the new jet and we flew the remainder of the schedule without incident.				When the outer pane of First Officer's windshield shattered as they were at FL230 on their way to FL390 the flight crew of a B737-700 elected to return to their departure airport for maintenance and a fresh jet.

Number 2 engine vibrations had been at .4 and vibration went to 1.7 accompanied by a slight grinding type noise from Number 2 engine. After about 45 seconds the noise stopped, vibrations stayed at 1.7, and all indications remained normal until about 180 miles east of our destination. ATC gave us a descent to FL360. When power was retarded, the vibrations went to 3.5 accompanied by a grinding noise from Number 2 engine. Shortly thereafter, the Number 2 engine oil filter bypass light illuminated. Per the QRH, we retarded the power slowly. The oil filter bypass light remained on even after power had been at idle for a short time. We shut down the engine and diverted to a nearby airport. An emergency was declared and the divert and landing were uneventful. After exiting the runway, CFR personnel examined the exterior of the Number 2 engine and the aircraft in general and advised there was no visible damage. We taxied to the gate and deplaned the passengers. A subsequent inspection discovered obvious internal engine damage.				A B737-700 experienced significant vibration in the right engine which became excessive and illuminated the oil filter bypass light when thrust was reduced to idle per the vibration checklist. The flight crew declared an emergency, shut down the engine and diverted to a nearby airport.

We were issued a heading and a decent from 6,000 feet to 5,000 feet. ATC advised traffic at one o'clock and five miles. We advised traffic was not in sight due to being in and out of IMC. ATC issued another vector and advised traffic appeared to be descending and at one mile. As we broke out of the clouds, the traffic was in front of us (moving right to left) in a rapid descending left turn. Immediately the TCAS called Traffic and Descend. The Captain kicked off the autopilot and pitched down and turned hard right to avoid the traffic. We estimate that we came within 200 feet vertical and 500 feet horizontal from the other aircraft. We leveled off at 4,000 feet and 10-20 degrees from our assigned heading. I advised ATC that we maneuvered in response to an RA and remained at 4000 feet. We continued and landed in BUR with no further issues. Hard to say what could have prevented this incident. The other aircraft was not talking to ATC and made several rapid maneuvers, apparently to avoid clouds. The TCAS system worked. We responded in a timely manner to avoid a collision.		Our aircraft was on a 170 degree heading at 5,000 feet MSL. We were IMC and on a vector off of the LYNXX 8 STAR into BUR. We had previously received a TCAS TA from traffic that had leveled off at 6,000 feet MSL. Our heading had placed us over terrain that peaked at 3,800 feet MSL (Oat Mountain), which was about 13 NM NW of BUR. Simultaneously, SoCal issued a Traffic Alert for that same traffic, we entered VMC conditions and spotted the traffic (appeared to be a Stearman), a TCAS RA 'Descend, Descend,' which was followed immediately by an 'Increase Descent.' I disengaged the autopilot and autothrust and began a descent, but immediately increased descent rate with the 'Increase Descent' call from the TCAS. The non-communicating traffic appeared to be 'scud running' by starting a sharp descending turn in front of us and heading southeast. I descended to 4,000 feet MSL with an avoidance turn to a heading of 190. In the commotion, my First Officer and I never heard the 'Clear of Conflict' call, but the display was clear. We advised SoCal of the deviation and our heading/altitude. The Controller cleared us to maintain 4,000 feet MSL with a vector to intercept the ILS to Runway 8. The Controller advised us that the traffic was inbound to VNY and was going to get a talking to by the Tower. We continued the approach and landing without further incident.		B737 flight crew reports taking evasive action for a TCAS RA during descent into BUR. Clouds obscured visual contact with the other aircraft until the first TCAS resolution had been enunciated.

I concluded that it was probably wake turbulence from an aircraft that had crossed sometime above us. After ensuring that the cabin crew and passengers were all okay, I called ATC (I believe it was MSP Center) to inquire what type of aircraft that had crossed above us. She told us that it was an A380 and it had crossed our path 6 minutes before. The First Officer stated that it was only 1,000 FT above us, but I can't swear to the actual crossing altitude as we had several aircraft crossing along our route at that time. It's my understanding that separation from A380 aircraft is supposed to be 2,000 FT and 5 minutes. Perhaps this should be reconsidered as the turbulence we encountered could have caused injuries to anyone up in the aisle or galley. We were fortunate that no one was injured. The incident happened at night so we were completely unaware that we were in the vicinity of an A380 and were not expecting any turbulence wake-related or otherwise. We were flying a B-737-800.				A B737-800 pilot experienced wake vortices from an A380 while en route.

I then observed the cabin climb rate was in excess of 1,000 feet per minute. At that time I also got a chime from the Lead Flight Attendant informing me that the L-1 door had a gap and was not completely closed. The Lead stated that the gap was big enough to slide his fingers through the gap. At the time of departure the aircraft weighed approximately 134,000 lbs. We contacted Dispatch and notified them of our situation and intentions to burn fuel down to landing weight of 128,000 lbs and return for landing. We ran the Weight Balance for 128,000 lb landing and determined that we needed less than 5,000 feet of runway. Operations also concurred and supported our decision to reduce our landing weight and return to field. Declared emergency. Notified Operations. Circled over the airport at 180 knots with the gear down flaps 15 at 4,000 feet MSL for 40 minutes. Returned to departure airport. Have gate agent verify that the door is completely sealed when door is shut. My understanding is that is common problem mechanically for the L-1 door.		During initial climb, the aircraft failed to pressurize properly. No door annunciators were illuminated, but the pressurization gauge confirmed the lack of pressurization. No pressurization annunciators were illuminated. The Captain was PF, and I was PNF. We coordinated with Tower to level off in our initial climb at 3,500 feet. Our Lead Flight Attendant contacted us on the flight deck, stating that the L1 door was making a lot of noise, and that he could put his fingers through the open space surrounding the door. Due to the noise, he was unable to hear our responses well. We stated that we were working on the problem and would get back to him shortly. We discussed the problem and options available. We contacted ATC, declaring an emergency condition. A second Flight Attendant attempted to communicate with us, but could not hear us over the cabin noise near the L1 door. Later we established communications with the aft Flight Attendant and exchanged information and stated that we would likely return due to the pressurization problem. We accepted vectors from Tower, and later Departure to stay near the airport. The Captain maintained control of the aircraft and managed ATC communications, while I contacted Dispatch/Maintenance. We again reviewed our options, came up with an initial plan to return to the airport, and notified the FA's of our plan. After burning fuel to meet landing weight, the Captain landed the aircraft without any further complication. A normal landing was accomplished at a landing weight of 127,100 lbs. (no overweight landing). Passengers were deplaned and Maintenance met the aircraft. Good crew coordination during this irregular situation.Although the cabin door handle was confirmed fully closed by the flight attendants, the door failed to seal properly. Maintenance later inspected the door for defects and found no discrepancies in it's' operation. It was reported by Maintenance that this may happen occasionally with the 737 due to the door's cam lock design. The aircraft was later returned to service and no further problems with the pressurization system were noted on the subsequent flight.		B737-700 flight crew reports failure of the aircraft to pressurize after takeoff and is informed shortly by the Lead Flight Attendant that the forward entry door is not sealed properly with a gap along the bottom of the door. Crew elects to return to the departure airport after burning down to landing weight.

It was VMC the whole flight so we anticipated a straight in to BNA. After passing ATL we were in our descent and had leveled off at FL240. Center mentioned he needed us back on the SWFFT RNAV STAR and we were cleared direct SWFFT for the SWFFT ONE North Transition. We loaded the arrival and headed direct to SWFFT. We were trying to determine the North transition which is not mentioned on the plates. That created confusion. I called Center to confirm the waypoints he wanted us to fly, but he was not responsive. We were not cleared to descend 'via' the SWFFT ONE arrival and Center did not have us descend to a lower altitude that would have been consistent with crossing altitudes at SWFFT. Center handed us off to Approach Control who then asked why we were still at FL240. We advised we had not been cleared to descend below FL240. There was a short delay and he cleared us down to 5,000 FT and we then began a descent to land with vectors to get down. We landed uneventfully. The First Officer and I discussed the fact we needed to descend to cross SWFFT but there were no instructions from Center to make that happen.I have not flown this RNAV arrival before and it is not in the company's current safety report data base so maybe it is new. There was precious time spent trying to determine the North Transition as requested by Center. I still cannot determine what the North Transition is. The PF noted a descent was needed and had we been given a timely clearance we would have been able make the altitudes per the arrival. I will be far more proactive in a scenario like this in the future. I was expecting a clearance from either Center or Approach.	The reporter advised the reason they had failed to request a lower altitude in a timely fashion was because he and the First Officer were distracted trying to find the North 'transition' they were given by the Center. He surmised the Controller may have used the word 'transition' in a generic fashion inasmuch as the 'Ball noted' tracks after ADAAY appear to have no 'ATC approved' descriptive nomenclature depicted on the chart. He agreed the use of the 'Landing North/South' language flight crews are advised will be advised to expect in the notes at the top of the chart would have been more appropriate and would not have distracted them to the same degree. He continued to be distressed that the Approach Controller was not more forthcoming when asked for clarification of their route after ADAAY.			A B737-800 flight crew inbound to Nashville was cleared to fly the SWFFT RNAV STAR, but because they were not 'cleared via' and had not received an 'independent' descent clearance, did not descend to cross SWFFT as charted. Approach Control ultimately provided descent clearance and vectors as necessary.

Fortunately seat belt sign was on and no injury to the passengers, however it did throw flight attendant into her aft jump seat area. We immediately contacted the all flight attendants after the event and learned she had injury to her shoulder and neck area, but not critical and no need for medical priority handling. Within several minutes we encountered a second event of light wake turbulence behind the same airplane. At this point we elected to slow our airspeed to 210, creating greater spacing. Made comments to ATC for reference, based on TCAS we already had approximately 5 miles or greater of separation when this took place. Landed on Runway 26L without incident and the other aircraft arrived on Runway 26R.				A320 Captain reported a wake vortex encounter following a B737-900 on arrival to IAH that resulted in a slight injury to a flight attendant.

The Captain lowered the landing gear handle and we both noticed the left main landing gear light did not illuminate. After a very brief discussion we both decided not to attempt a landing. At approximately 1,000 feet we executed a normal go around and were cleared to 4,000 feet. At 4,000 feet we were vectored by ATC allowing time to declare an emergency, execute the Gear Disagree [checklist] and review the Partial Gear Landing checklist. After executing the appropriate checklists we were vectored to final, executed an uneventful landing and stopped straight ahead on runway.		[On final, after placing gear handle down] left main gear light did not illuminate. Pressed the light fixture and light did illuminate while being held in. Test switch on overhead panel would NOT illuminate the light. Between 1,000 feet and 500 feet we elected to go missed approach. Did a normal go around and accepted 4,000 feet and vectors. Advised flight attendants what was happening. Prior to downwind gear lever placed down with same results. Pressed light fixture numerous times with same results. Accomplished the Gear Disagree checklist including alternate gear extension with no improvement in the condition. Declared an emergency, asked company be notified and equipment standing by. Said we would stop straight ahead on the runway. Flight attendants told to prep for emergency landing with possible left gear collapse. Inside 500 feet I advised BRACE over the PA. Landed without incident. Advised [passengers] over PA to remain seated. Stopped on the runway. Met by crash equipment and awaited for Maintenance to arrive and pin all three gear. Taxied to gate without incident.		A320 flight crew reported left main gear light remained out after gear extension. They ran appropriate checklists, declared an emergency, and landed normally.

Briefed flight attendants to remain seated due to expected turbulence in climbout, and turbulence box was shown on weather sheet.  Light to moderate chop/turbulence on climbout, which was more intense after 10,000 feet.  Slowed from 250 KTS and selected 225 KTS to expedite climb.  Heading Select/Level Change engaged.  Number two thrust lever retarded, then advanced, retarded, advanced to overspeed.  Number one thrust lever automatically moved opposite of #2 until A/T disconnect.  By then we had overspeed and overtemp on #2 followed shortly by [overspeed and overtemp on] #1.  Right turn back toward [departure airport] for return to field.  Declared emergency.  Started Overtemp checklist and #2 engine insidiously failed.  Aircraft had moderate yaw and pitch oscillation.  Took a long time to stabilize aircraft.   Talked to flight attendants: engine surges, return to field, and I did not expect to evacuate upon landing.  Single Engine Landing Checklist for Flaps 15.  Fire equipment requested.  Uneventful landing, cleared runway, and fire crew checked both right and left engines and aircraft.  Taxied back to gate, gave aircraft to Maintenance, debriefed fire department, Ops, Inflight, Flight Ops, and police.  Conducted 15-minute debrief of entire Crew with Chief Pilot, Inflight Recurrent Trainer, and Inflight representative present.  Important to note: crew functioned exceptionally well, managing aircraft, passengers, also, those assisting after return to gate to accommodate passengers and their needs of travel.  The insidious, rapidly changing situation and high speed development of this incident is something I have never seen in 32 years of flying.  Flight duration was 13 minutes from takeoff to landing.		Climbing through approximately 12,000 feet, the power seemed to reduce and the autothrottles commanded the thrust levers back. As this is not normal with a Level Change autothrottle climb, the Captain put his hand on the thrust levers as to correct the situation, but momentarily thereafter the engines began to surge and the Captain disengaged the autothrottles. Within a matter of seconds, the engine surges resulted in alternating overspeed/overtemp conditions on both engines. The Captain positioned the thrust levers in the mid-range, disconnected the autopilot, and began a level out. I called Departure and told them we needed to stop the climb, that we were working an engine issue.I reached for the QRH and began to turn to the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall Checklist when I noticed the #2 Engine had failed with ENG FAIL displayed on the display. I then turned to the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist and began reading off the items. We completed the checklist following the steps to shut down engine #2. We quickly discussed restart potential once established on downwind and decided against it considering the overspeed/overtemp condition and proximity to the landing runway.		B737-700 flight crew experienced surging/overspeed/overtemp on both engines on climbout from a high altitude airport. Number 2 engine spontaneously failed, so after running the checklists the flight declared an emergency and returned to departure airport.

The 'A' Flight Attendant also smelled it, while the 'C' Flight Attendant did not. At that time, the Captain spoke with the flight attendants via the inter-phone to get more information, and he determined that a diversion was necessary and we agreed on an alternate airport. We coordinated with ATC informing them of our intentions and the emergency was declared. We complied with the Smoke/Fire/Fumes QRH Checklist. The Captain was the pilot flying and I communicated with ATC during the descent, spoke with the flight attendants per the abnormal checklist, and retrieved the airport charts from the alternate binder. I completed all of the abnormal and normal checklists as we were on final approach, and we landed overweight at 129.4 LBS and stopped on the runway. The Tower asked if we could clear the runway, and we did so. At this time, the fire crews pulled up next to the aircraft and asked what our area of concern was: we reported over-wing/ mid-cabin. Fire crews completed a visual exterior and thermal imaging inspection with no defects noted, and we then taxied to the gate. After coordinating with Maintenance, Dispatch, and local Customer Service, the customers were deplaned.		[The Flight Attendant] described that the fumes could be from a possible electrical fire in the cabin overhead. He indicated that the fumes were not dissipating.		B737-800 flight crew had a Flight Attendant notify them of an acrid electric smell at mid-cabin. Flight crew declared an emergency and diverted.

The phraseology used was 'intercept the approach course, maintain 180 KTS'. At this point, we were still restricted to 4,000 and not cleared the approach. Pilot not flying queried ATC asking, 'Are we cleared the RNAV RNP 13C approach?' ATC stated that we were cleared the RNAV RNP 13C approach. ATC should have cleared us initially to the IAF with subsequent clearance for the approach. Instead, we received confusing instructions and a speed restriction which was counter to the speeds directed in the RNP system. We missed the 2,500 altitude restriction because of the confusion of the ATC instruction. Unfortunately, we see Approach Control too often attempt to use the RNP approaches but use improper terminology, add additional non-standard altitude and speed instructions overlapping the directives of the published RNP approaches. These approaches do not work if ATC insists on overriding the details of the approaches.				A B737-700 flight crew took exception to the phraseology utilized by Approach Control when clearing their flight to intercept and fly the RNAV (GPS) Z Runway 13C approach to MDW.

As we were climbing through FL230 I heard loud, rapid, snapping sounds. I asked the First Officer if he also heard it? He replied that he did. We tried to figure out its cause when I noticed a strong electrical burning smell. I asked him if also could smell it which initially he replied no. Then a resounding yes! He quickly donned his mask while I declared an emergency with an immediate turn back to the airfield. The First Officer turned toward the departure airport while I ran the Smoke, Fire and Fumes Checklist. The First Officer told me that he had momentarily seen smoke coming from the glareshield. At this time the smoke and snapping sound had stopped. And the fumes had dissipated. I called the flight attendants and gave then the emergency landing signal. We continued our precautionary landing with the emergency equipment standing by. We landed and arrived at the gate without further incident.		Continuing the climb with Engine Anti-Ice on, at approximately FL240 we heard a series of pops coming from behind the instrument panel. This was followed by a strong electrical odor. As I was looking around, I saw a momentary wisp of white/grey-ish smoke coming from up from the area between the windshield and the glare shield. I immediately donned my mask, while the Captain declared an emergency requesting lower and a turn. We executed a turn back to the airport and an emergency descent. The fumes did subside as we made our way back.		A B737-700 climbing through FL230 developed an electrical burning smell accompanied by a momentary bluish/grey smoke near the windshield, so an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

Neither the pilots nor flight attendants reported any abnormalities. I called Maintenance Operational Control (MOC) to clarify a date on an MEL item listed on the Flight Release to confirm it was correct, and was advised it was. Upon completion of the cockpit setup and preflight walk around by the First Officer, we completed the Preflight Checklist; I briefed the flight attendants, and then waited for the completion of boarding. Completion of boarding, pushback, engine start and taxi to the assigned departure Runway 28 was uneventful. Our position in the takeoff line up was number 3 behind two air carrier aircraft. After both departed, Tower cleared us for takeoff; I transferred control to the First Officer, who was the Pilot Flying (PF), he powered up as appropriate with a pause at 1.05 to allow the engines to spool, then proceeded to apply power to the Flex Thrust setting. No abnormalities were noted during this phase until, in retrospect, the aircraft reached the speed of 80 KIAS and the '80 Knots - Power Set' callout. I was the Pilot Monitoring (PM) and made the callout but noticed that the right engine (Engine 2) was slightly hunting for the correct power setting of approximately 1.35 EPR while the left engine had locked onto the appropriate setting. The fluctuation in the right engine was minimal, around 0.005 EPR and seemed to stabilize by 90-95 KIAS. This appeared insignificant at the time. The rest of the takeoff throughout the initial climb to 10,000 MSL was uneventful. Upon climbing past 10,000 MSL to an assigned altitude of Flight Level 230 (FL230) the aircraft was about to enter possible icing conditions therefore Engine Anti-Ice was turned ON in preparation. No abnormalities were noted and climb-out continued uneventfully until approximately 20,000 MSL where icing conditions no longer existed and the Engine Anti-Ice was turned OFF. Shortly thereafter, we were alerted by a single chime to the ECAM display indicating the following message: 'ENG 2 FUEL CTL FAULT' and subsequent action items below the title line. ATC directed us to climb to FL300, to which I responded our need to maintain this altitude because we were working a problem and would advise when able. The First Officer remained as PF, maintaining control of the aircraft and assuming communications. I began executing the ECAM actions the first of which, if I remember correctly, commanded the Thrust Lever on the affected engine be reduced to idle for 30 seconds. As we confirmed and slowly reduced the ENG 2 thrust lever, I noticed the trend arrows on the EPR gauge displayed the commanded power reduction to the new EPR TLA position (idle). I further noticed the engine initially had not spooled down completely on its own but was at a reduced power setting as compared to ENG 1. The engine then proceeded to match the idle thrust lever setting, after the 30 seconds had expired, the next ECAM Action Line commanded to return the thrust lever to the Climb Detent to presumably check the ability to control the engine. This action had no effect and ENG 2 remained at IDLE thrust. Subsequent ECAM Action command lines included placing the Engine Mode Selector to IGN/START and then shutting down the affected engine. I continued performing subsequent additional ECAM Actions of 'ENG 2 FAIL' thereby securing the engine, and confirming failed systems on the ECAM display. It was at this time the APU was started. A plan of action was devised to return to the departure airport since it was both the closest airport and closest Company airport. I re-assumed control of communications and declared an emergency to ATC and requested vectors to return to the departure airport. ATC immediately complied as did we with a turn back to the departure airport. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch stating our condition and returning. I notified the Lead Flight Attendant ofthe aircraft status, time remaining to landing, my intent not to evacuate unless other indications led to an evacuation decision and finally that I would be making an announcement to the passengers. I then calmly made the PA announcement to the passengers informing them of what had occurred, emphasizing that the aircraft was still very safe to continue flight, and that we would be landing in 15 minutes. I finally added that the flight attendants would be giving them further instructions. After completion of all the immediate action items, the First Officer and I reviewed and completed the appropriate COM items while continuing to the airport. Descending through 10,000 MSL, I informed the flight attendants over the PA then shortly thereafter called the Lead Flight Attendant via the intercom to confirm they were indeed ready for landing and obtained an update as to the status of the passenger cabin. The lead informed me they were ready, the cabin was prepared and the passengers were calm. We finished our duties and prepared for the landing, selected Flaps 3 on the MCDU and GPWS Mode Panel on the overhead, then performed a quick review of what we had accomplished to this point. The remainder of the approach and landing occurred without incident. The landing was 'on target/on speed' and under MGLW. Fire trucks followed us down the runway as we decelerated toward the exit. We queried Ground Control regarding any other signs of damage, smoke or fire to which the reply was negative; this was also confirmed by the Fire Marshall. I announced 'Flight Attendants Stations' to keep the crew informed of my decision not to evacuate the aircraft. We continued to the gate uneventfully. Once parked and all checklist were completed.				An A320 ECAM alerted ENG 2 FUEL CTL FAULT, so as the ECAM checklist was accomplished, the engine shutdown as directed, an emergency declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

When we placed the switch in STBY RUD, the Feel Diff Press, Stby Rud On and Yaw Damp lights illuminated, which seemed appropriate for the procedure but were not mentioned in the QRH. I consulted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. Maintenance Control advised that flight control operation would be normal; however we would not have use of 2 flight spoilers. This is not mentioned in the QRH. Based upon this information and the increased yaw oscillation, we declared an emergency and diverted. With the anticipation of possible extra braking being needed, we requested ARFF meet the aircraft. Landed without incident. When ARFF advised that the brakes appeared normal, we terminated the emergency and taxied to the gate without further incident.		AT cruise (FL 310) B system flight control low pressure light came on. Completed flight control low pressure light checklist and diverted to ZZZ1 (Destination was ZZZ).Checklist provided no guidance regarding degradation of systems.

As cabin altitude continues to climb cabin altitude displays red followed by CAB PR EXCESS CAB ALT ECAM (my recollection). Donned masks and requested lower from ATC. First Officer flying and Captain runs through ECAM checklist. Recall 3 or 4 steps. CREW OXY MASK - ON, ATC - NOTIFY, PAX OXY MASKS - MAN ON. Followed ECAM. ATC asks if we are declaring an emergency and at that point we state affirmative. They give us direct to destination as we decide on alternates. First Officer continues to step down. Recall at one point Safety Valve Position drives open then closes. Feel a cool refreshing air flow. At approximately 16,000 feet enter into FM and this suggests trying CABIN PRESS MODE SEL to MAN. Doesn't appear to respond. Continue our descent and request a phone patch to Dispatch. Also ACARS Dispatch stating that we have declared an emergency and request possible alternate airports if necessary. Response from Dispatch is that destination looks good. Once through 10,000 feet, remove oxygen masks and then level off at 8,000 feet. Notice cabin altitude is equal to aircraft altitude. Establish communications with Purser, passengers and Dispatch. Decide not to Maintenance as we are closing in on destination and everything is under control. First Officer briefs approach and lands uneventfully.		We were getting step down descents, FL380, FL360, and was now level at FL320. ECAM for Cabin Pressure. Saw cabin pressure rising over 8,000 feet, both pilots donned O2 masks, Captain worked ECAM, [and] I continued to fly. Cabin pressure continued to rise, we declared emergency and requested lower. Aircraft continued to slowly depressurize. Captain continued with ECAM (including passenger mask deployment), QRC, and into the FM. Captain commented that Manual Pressurization did not seem to be working well either. I was working with ATC to get lower as [soon as] possible, we were over the mountains so step downs came in intervals, first FL200, then 16,000 feet, then 14,000 feet, and eventually down to 8,000 feet. Captain was working with Purser and Dispatch, we agreed on continuing to destination as the aircraft was now able to be flown de-pressurized. At one point during descent, aircraft began to over pressurize and safety valve opened. At 8,000 feet we removed O2 masks, Captain and I got back on the same page, reviewed approach, finished checklists, conferred and confirmed everything that needed to be done had been done, and concluded with an uneventful ILS in VMC conditions. Autopilot was engaged until the outer marker. On taxi in, ECAM calling to make sure cabin was depressurized, I was able to manually open outflow valve at this point.		A320 flight crew experiences a gradual loss of cabin pressurization during initial descent for landing with the First Officer the pilot flying. ECAM actions are complied with when cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 feet and manual pressurization is attempted. At one point during descent, aircraft began to over pressurize and safety valve opens. Flight continues to destination for normal landing and during taxi in ECAM alerts to cabin being pressurized on the ground.

We coordinated with ATC for a lower altitude while running the Drive Light QRH procedures. While running the QRH, we noticed an acrid smell in the cockpit followed by notification from the flight attendants of the same smell throughout the cabin. We then accomplished the QRH items for fumes in the cockpit and began to coordinate with ATC for an even lower altitude and request for diversion to a nearby airport. We also declared an emergency at this point and notified Dispatch and the flight attendants as well as getting the divert airport weather and getting performance calculations and getting out the appropriate approach plates and keeping the passengers informed as well as running the Descent and Before Landing Checklists. We coordinated for emergency response vehicles to meet us after clearing the runway to confirm there was no fire and that it would be safe to taxi to the gate. They cleared us to the gate and then the Captain contacted Dispatch/Maintenance Control/and Chief Pilot on Call after debriefing the emergency response crew. A logbook entry was made.		The next day, I followed up with Maintenance and they reported that the #2 GCU in the E&E bay was fried and the #2 Generator had also been replaced.Sometimes mechanical things break. I am not sure how to prevent that. The amount of time between the event, the decision to divert, and the actual landing was not long. Communication between the pilots, the flight attendants, and ATC was critical. We train in the simulator on a regular basis. The amount of information to process in terms of communication/coordination and checklists is dynamic and hard to accurately re-create for a time critical event in the real world. We were able to accomplish all required normal and non-normal tasks before landing. I can see how something like a fire immediately after takeoff would further complicate this scenario further reducing the time to respond to the event. In some situations, priorities will likely need to be decided and only the very essential tasks may be accomplished prior to landing the airplane. Please re-emphasize this in our training program.		A B737-700 #2 Generator Control Unit (GCU) and Generator malfunctioned in flight illuminating the #2 Transfer Bus Off and Generator Drive Lights as well as creating electrical fumes in the aircraft so an emergency was declared and the flight diverted safely to a nearby airport.

The Captain (pilot flying) immediately accomplished the engine limit/surge/stall immediate action items by disengaging the autothrottle and pulling back the affected thrust lever to maintain limits. After several more surges, the engine stabilized at a normal power and thrust setting. Pilot not flying ran the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall Checklist in conjunction with the pilot flying. The Captain conferred with Dispatch to determine an appropriate landing location. Dispatch mutually agreed upon a divert to a nearby airport, which was accomplished without further incident.No Crew actions could have prevented this event as it was an engine-related malfunction. The crew performed admirably and safely recovered the aircraft and all persons onboard.				A B737-700 #2 Engine surged to well over 100% at climb power so the Captain immediately completed the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall QRH procedure and the flight diverted to a nearby airport.

Received a call from the Lead [Flight Attendant] telling me there was a strong burning plastic smell from the aft galley. He briefed me on the actions he and the other two flight attendants took to locate the source and mitigate it. They were unable to locate the source and asked if one of us could come back and take a look. My initial concern was someone might be trying to breach the cockpit. I don't like the cart being moved or a pilot going into the cabin during flight. We established security was normal and decided the First Officer would go to the aft galley. I got the weather for an airport (we were less than 100 NM from it) and other airports along our route. I fully expected the First Officer to return and tell me he found the problem and it was nothing of note. Upon his return, the First Officer expressed concern about the burning smell. I told the Lead that at that time we might be diverting. I'd let him know in a few minutes. At the same time, I sent an ACARS to Dispatch to call me with Maintenance Control. After the Lead left the flight deck, the First Officer further briefed me as to his opinion. He then told me 'Captain, in my best crew resource management, I strongly recommend divert.' Dispatch was on the radio at this time. Dispatch was breaking up and hard to understand, Maintenance was impossible to understand. I gave the radios and aircraft to the First Officer, told him to declare an emergency. We donned our oxygen masks, established communications. I told the flight attendants we were diverting, made an announcement that we were making a precautionary landing, sent an ACARS to Dispatch in case he didn't copy while on the radio, got the ATIS, loaded the box for the arrival to divert city. I turned off the Galley/CAB switch then inquired the cabin crew about the burning smell. I have to admit, Swissair accident was going through my mind, the speed of that fire. I was informed that after I turned off the power, the smell went away. We landed on the runway. Almost the entire event went smooth, no additional threats, just as trained at the training center. Great CRM between pilots and cabin, the only real problem I saw was our new Flight Manual format. It took too long to find information and checklists. We need tabs in it. I wanted to review the Smoke/Fumes checklist in case it was needed later, took too long to find. I would have liked a little systems review, took too long to find. Since my iPad was off, I didn't try it. It would take too long to boot up and too many sign-ins.				An A320 Lead Flight Attendant notified the Captain of an aft galley burning plastic smell. After the First Officer investigated, an emergency was declared and the flight diverted to an enroute airport.

I was hand-flying the aircraft, so I smoothly leveled the aircraft off at 12,000 FT while my First Officer donned his oxygen mask. I notified ATC that we were going to stop our climb at 12,000 FT then I donned my oxygen mask. In the meantime, my First Officer realized that the engine bleeds were off and the APU bleed was turned on. He turned on the left engine bleed air, turned off the APU bleed air (the APU was off), and the cabin slowly began to descend. Once the cabin began to descend, we turned on the remaining engine bleed air. The cabin altitude descended below 10,000 FT within a minute, so we removed our oxygen masks and checked the QRH Cabin Altitude Warning Checklist. We then resumed a normal climb.		The new engine start procedures are still very uncomfortable to accomplish after numerous repetitions. Whether true or not, I feel pressure to rush engine starts and after engine start flows from several captains.		B737-700 flight crew reported getting the cabin altitude warning horn on climbout, at which point they realized the engine bleeds were off.

All altitude/speed constraints were verified to be correct in the FMS prior to the Descend Via clearance, and all constraints were met by the PF using selected modes because we noticed ahead of time that the FMS was in error. We were at FL360 (ALT CRZ) and were given Descend Via the KOHOE ONE. The pilot flying put 9,000 FT in the Altitude Selector. We also increased the Cost Index to 35 to make sure the descent speed was at least 280 KTS. At this time, the FMS showed a proper Top of Descent (TOD) to meet HMRHD at FL340 and the FMS indicated this. However, the FMS also showed HERNG with a planned altitude of FL340 (with an orange asterisk). KOHOE, SAYGE, and MOKME all also had incorrect high planned altitudes with orange asterisks.We began a managed descent (DES) at the TOD and it went into ALT CST mode at HMRHD at FL340. When this happened, a new TOD appeared but it was past HERNG (which was supposed to be at or below FL320). At this point the PF selected V/S [Vertical Speed mode] to meet the restriction at HERNG. When we crossed HERNG at FL320, the PROG page showed us 2,000 FT below the managed/planned glide path. Throughout the arrival we continued to meet the constraints in V/S mode even though the managed/planned glide path and altitudes still indicated high (with orange asterisks). We remained in managed speed at 280 KTS, until approximately 2 NM prior to KOHOE when the FMS speed changed to 250 KTS, so the pilot flying went into selected speed at 280 KTS (per the arrival). Nearly every constraint on this arrival was calculated incorrectly in Managed Descent mode, except the 'hard' constraint at DOGGG. Inbound from SAYGE it looked like managed DES (with selected speed) would work, so the PF managed DES. However, the FMS still planned FL173 at MOKME (even after we pushed the correct altimeter setting). The pilot flying selected V/S again to meet the restriction yet when we crossed MOKME at exactly 17,000 the PROG page showed that we were 350 FT below the managed/planned glide path. Lastly, several miles prior to DOGGG when the FMS should have reduced managed speed to 210 KTS (per the arrival), it actually went into Approach mode and reduced to green dot. This arrival would have caused violations of altitude and/or speed at almost every waypoint had we not been closely watching its every move.The FMS needs to be tested and corrected on this (and all) of the arrivals to ensure it is working properly. I have had the same problems (to a lesser extent) on the EAGUL FIVE RNAV ARRIVAL (landing east) into PHX, where the FMS will do an ALT CST at TINIZ (at FL330 even though the restriction is 'At or below FL330'), and then begin a descent too late to meet the restriction at PAYSO. Also, on the JAGGR arrival (DEN), the FMS 'dives' to FL270 at LYNKN even though this constraint is 'At or above FL270', then shallows into a very shallow descent to CLPTN. This is not needed and not efficient. When the constraint at LYNKN is deleted it calculates a much better crossing altitude of FL302 with a THR IDLE descent all the way down. The FMS seems to work correctly when there is a hard altitude/speed constraint. But something is not working properly in the FMS when it calculates these descent profiles when there is an 'At or above/below' or a 'Between' constraint.				A-320 fails to comply with the complex altitude and airspeed restrictions on the KOHOE RNAV STAR to DEN. The reporter believes the problems to be systemic to the A-320 autoflight systems and backs that opinion up by citing previous similar problems when attempting to comply with similar RNAV STAR arrivals at PHX and DEN.

When the aircraft was ready for departure, it was determined that 28 connecting passengers would miss our already late flight. At that time, the Agents realized that the flight wasn't properly loaded for departure without those 28 passengers, so Ramp was directed to redistribute our bags to accommodate CG considerations since this was an -800 series aircraft. By the time that had been completed and paperwork was complete, it was determined by the Agents that we would then wait for the connecting passengers from two other inbound flights after all. Once those passengers and bags arrived (27 additional passengers with baggage), a new load closeout sheet was sent to the flightdeck and the performance was calculated. We set stabilizer trim as calculated and proceeded to start engines, taxi, and takeoff. At the rotate call, I applied aft stick pressure to the yoke and noted that forces were considerably higher than anticipated, especially as I neared the aft stop. At nearly full aft stick travel of the yoke I was about to call for emergency thrust when nose strut extension finally occurred. I estimate that several hundred feet of additional takeoff roll was required to unstick from the runway. Aircraft loading and CG was clearly not what the paperwork reflected as the stick forces and elevator displacement were unacceptably high and the rotation significantly delayed as a result. I doubt the aircraft would have been flyable if an engine failure had occurred after V1 in this case. We may want to consider return to the [original] loading schedule on -800 aircraft to more clearly articulate to all parties how the aircraft is actually loaded. Additional oversight should be instituted when multiple changes to passengers, baggage, or cargo configuration have been performed on -800 series aircraft. Stabilizer trim setting incorrect due to aircraft weight and balance issue.		The aircraft was loaded using recently instituted loading procedures. During the loading process, the first Agent told me he had directed the ramp to move bags from one cargo bin to another. I wasn't told how many bags or how they were moved. I was then told by the Agent that since we were delayed by bag loading, the Company decided to have us wait for connecting Passengers. We originally had approximately 80 Passengers onboard, and we finally took off with 107. During the wait, a new Agent took over the flight. After the plane was boarded, the Agent determined that approximately 20 bags needed to be moved from the forward cargo compartment to the aft compartment. We recomputed the takeoff data using the new weight and balance sheet and conducted the Checklist. The aircraft trim was set in accordance with the calculations. This flight was the First Officer's leg. When I called rotation, I noticed the nose of the aircraft did not rotate normally. The aircraft was late to rotate and the First Officer was unable to establish the normal takeoff pitch. I told the First Officer to get the nose up, to which he replied that he was trying. He was able to establish a normal takeoff/climbout pitch as the airspeed increased and he added nose up trim. The aircraft loading and weight and balance computations for this flight resulted in a takeoff configuration that had less than desired controllability for rotation and takeoff. The loading computations should be reviewed to determine if there were any errors made. If there were no errors made, it may be prudent to return to the [original] boarding procedure. If I were to fly a partially loaded -800 again using single-zone loading, I will ask the Flight Attendants to provide me with a zone-by-zone passenger count. I would use this count to determine whether or not to direct the Agent to use the [original] procedure.		B737-800 flight crew describe last minute changes to the passenger count and bag loading that results in an inaccurate load sheet and an incorrect takeoff trim setting.

Consulted all aircraft checklists, FM Normal, non-normal, emergencies and found no relevant info or guidance. Conference call with Maintenance Control, Dispatch, and Duty Manager. I expressed great concern over a fuel pump running that I could not shut off, in an empty fuel tank that has not been modified with an inerting system. Concern over dry fuel pump overheating was indicated by all crew members. Maintenance Control advised that ...PULLING...the L2P210 CB would remove power from the switch, the ARINC629 bus that controls the cards for fuel pump control and the pump would shut off. The FOM was consulted. The Flight Manual Limits page did not prohibit...PULLING...of the P21o L2 CB. I advised Maintenance Control and Dispatch, that I would use 'CAPT EMERGENCY AUTHORITY' to pull the CB. Relief pilot and flying First Officer were briefed and Flying First Officer designated Captain. I entered E+E bay and pulled CB. Fuel synoptic, FMC Maintenance page and MAT all confirmed pump was now deactivated. The aircraft was now operationally normal. Maintenance, Dispatch and Duty Manager were all consulted and it was agreed to continue to our planned destination. Thirty minutes later the Duty Manager called and ordered divert to an enroute station per 'FLEET' and an EMERGENCY was declared. Dumped fuel landed. Refilled, fueled, and pushed. Ramp called to return to gate. The Chief Pilot advised crew removed from trip and deadhead home tomorrow.		[Narrative 2 contains no additional information.]		A B777 EICAS alerted CTR TANKS LOW, but the right center tank would not turn off. The circuit breaker was pulled but because that procedure was not authorized, the Duty Manager diverted the aircraft and removed the crew.

I deleted the speed restriction from MNSTR, which also removed the altitude restriction to cross between 15,000 and 16,000. I then selected Speed Intervention 280 KIAS. The CDU showed that we would cross MNSTR at about 15,500, so I didn't bother reentering the restriction. The increased speed, however, caused us to descend faster and we actually crossed MNSTR at about 14,200. There was no traffic conflict, nor did ATC mention the deviation.I should have entered an altitude at MNSTR after deleting the speed. Also, I think returning to VNAV PATH would have had us crossing MNSTR at a correct altitude. A limitation of the FMC is that one cannot remove a speed without also deleting the associated altitude.		We discussed the best way to delete the speed [at MNSTR] while keeping the altitude restriction (I don't think there is one!). We selected delete without executing and it showed us crossing fix at 15,600 (small font [which identifies a predicted altitude, not a hard one]) if we were on profile for subsequent fixes.I'm still not sure of the best way to delete a speed restriction on a fix that also has a crossing altitude 'window' (below and above altitudes). But we know that we shouldn't have selected Speed Intervention and we should have stayed in [VNAV] PATH. At the very least, if we had entered the 'floor' altitude of the fix in the page, we wouldn't have descended below it. Obviously better coordination and monitoring also would've prevented this error.		When ATC deleted their speed restriction at MNSTR on the GEELA RNAV STAR to PHX the flight crew of a B737-700 was uncertain of how to do so in the FMC while retaining the crossing window above 15,000 and below 16,000. They opted to exit VNAV PATH and continue their descent in speed intervene mode in anticipation the FMC predicted crossing would comply with the restriction.

I stopped the descent and climbed back to 10,000. I looked at the MCP and VNAV was no longer engaged. Re-engaged VNAV and continued an uneventful approach and landing.		Just prior to MINZA the pilot flying used CWS pitch to stop the aircraft from continuing to descend when he observed it passing 10,000. The lowest altitude I saw was approximately 9,650.At that time we noticed VNAV was no longer engaged. We re-engaged VNAV and completed the approach and landing.		For reasons unknown the FMS on their B737-700 dropped out of VNAV while descending on the RIIVR RNAV STAR, Runway 24R at LAX. The aircraft descended about 400 FT below the crossing restriction at MINZA.

That was followed by G HYD RSV LO. At the time we were operating in a high workload environment; on vectors and communicating with Departure about an altitude change. When the ECAM annunciated, we requested a level-off and vectors while we worked the problem. The Captain declared an emergency, and we prepared the aircraft for a return. We completed the checklists and requested vectors for a visual approach. The landing was uneventful. The Captain stopped on the runway. Airport fire services were on hand to inspect the exterior. Maintenance towed us in to the gate.		Passing 10,000 feet the Green Low Pressure and Green Reservoir ECAMS activated. Leveled off at 11,000 feet and asked for spacing vectors. After determining the Green System was lost and ECAM actions were complete, we called Dispatch and Maintenance to review the problem. The crew elected to return and Maintenance and Dispatch concurred. An emergency was declared and ATC was advised of the situation and the need to stop on the runway for a tow-in due to loss of nose wheel steering. Landing was uneventful and the aircraft was brought to a stop on the centerline. Fire trucks reviewed the aircraft and advised that hydraulic fluid was leaking onto the runway. The tug was connected and the aircraft towed to gate.		A320 flight crew experiences a Green Hydraulic system low pressure followed by a reservoir low level ECAM climbing out of 10,000 feet. An emergency is declared and the flight returns to the departure airport.

We completed the ECAM steps, referenced the Flight Manual, conferred with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and evaluated our landing performance. With their inputs included we determined the appropriate course of action was to continue to destination. Flight attendants and passengers were advised. We used the gravity gear extension procedure as per the Flight Manual and executed a normal landing. We taxied clear of runway and were towed to the gate.		In cruise flight, Green Hydraulic System began to lose fluid. We first noticed this during routine periodic system review and got to watch it drain before our eyes. Fluid depleted and ECAM triggered. ECAM procedure was followed, Flight Handbook procedure was reviewed, Dispatch and Maintenance Control were conferenced, and we discussed our options, deciding that proceeding to destination was the best available choice. Remainder of flight was uneventful and routine. Flight attendants were briefed, ATC and destination airport were advised, and passengers were informed. Approach and landing were normal, with consideration of unique requirements of the procedure. We landed, taxied clear of the runway, shut down the engines, and were towed to the gate by company Maintenance personnel. Flight concluded without any further occurrences.		A320 flight crew reports loss of Green Hydraulic System pressure at FL340 due to loss of Green System fluid. Crew elects to continue to destination and lands normally after using alternate means of landing gear extension.

Recognized engine failure and Captain assumed control of aircraft. Declared emergency with Center and began drift down descent to FL290. Executed Engine Fail Checklist from QRH. Started APU. Attempted engine in flight start; which failed. Noticed spar valve was not opening and no indication of fuel flow on start attempt. Attempted second start attempt at FL220 with same result. Secured engine per checklist. Notified cabin crew to perform emergency briefing for divert into [a nearby airport], maintained FL200. Decided nearest suitable airport to be ZZZ based on longer runway, better breaking action report, lower landing weight, better familiarity. Obtained weather and performance numbers from Dispatch for [the divert airport], all within flaps 15 limits. Planned and briefed flaps 15 landing and executed Single Engine Descent checklist. Notified passengers of divert. Executed Single Engine Approach checklist and again obtained current weather and breaking action reports, still within limits. Executed Single Engine Landing checklist for RNAV approach autobrake max. Landed overweight by approximately 1,500 LBS breaking action good. Clear of runway requested exterior inspection from emergency response personnel, who reported no abnormalities. Taxied to gate.		LNAV/VNAV engaged with autopilot/autothrottle engaged. The Number 2 Engine flamed out and rolled back. This caused a slight yawing motion and the AT disengaged. No fuel flow or EGT was indicated. The engine was wind milling with no vibration noted. I was the pilot not flying, and recognized the failure first as my First Officer had his dinner on his lap. I took control of the aircraft, applied rudder to control yaw and switched the autopilot to my side. I remained in control/pilot flying until arrival at divert airport. An in flight emergency was declared with Center, and lower altitude was obtained for drift down. The Engine Failure and Shutdown Checklist was started, and we did attempt an inflight start with no fuel flow or EGT indicated. We also noticed the Spar Valve remained in the closed position after the start lever was raised to idle. We were still outside the in-flight start envelope. We then contacted Dispatch and filled them in on the details and received weather and braking action reports for [two nearby airports]. Analyzing this information, we decided to proceed to ZZZ/Re-Dispatch as the weather was about the same (VFR), but the breaking action reports was better, runway longer, lower weight due fuel burn, more familiar with Airport, and a bigger fire/rescue infrastructure in place. We were cleared direct [a nearby] VOR to maintain at or above 14,000 FT by Center. By now, drift down stabilized at FL200, and we ran the above mentioned checklist again as we were within the in-flight start envelope with the same results. Cabin crew was notified about our situation and plan and was told to prepare the cabin and do another safety briefing. A cabin PA was also completed at this time to complement/explain the additional flight attendant briefing and the planned landing in ZZZ. At that time we had about 35 minutes to landing. Decent Checklist was completed; the RNAV Flaps 15/autobrake maximum was briefed as well as the expected (737-900 flaps 15) over-weight landing at 145.5K. Approach Checklist was completed per QRH. We were cleared for the requested approach and landed without incident. Updated weather and performance was provided by Dispatch. The runway environment was in sight at the FAF with some very light snow. Braking action was good. After exiting the runway, we asked the Fire/Rescue Crew to check our brakes due to the maximum braking effort with no adverse findings. Another PA was completed explaining the event in more detail while this was being completed. Taxi to gate without incident.		B737NG flight crew experiences an engine failure at FL340. Indications are that the spar fuel valve has closed uncommanded. Attempts to restart the engine during descent are unsuccessful and the flight diverts to a suitable airport.

Immediately, in search of a smoother altitude, we requested lower and found FL360 to be a better ride. As I was doing my cruise flow, I noticed we had a fuel imbalance of around 500 LBS. This alerted us to examine the possibility of a fuel leak. As per the QRH, verifying fuel load and calculated as per the flight plan's anticipated burn, we established the correct FROB and both engine's FF to be correct at around 2,500 LBS. We continued to closely monitor the burn and found the imbalance increasing rapidly with no logical explanation. To prevent the imbalance exceeding any limitations, we tried to opening the crossfeed, which turned out not to be working because of a tripped crossfeed valve circuit breaker. At this point, we agreed to get Maintenance and Dispatch in the loop and my First Officer tried to establish communication. Unfortunately this took about 10 to 15 minutes and by this point the imbalance had reached over 1,000 LBS. The left tank was by now below 2,800 pounds. We were still well over 220 miles from [destination] with [another suitable airport] on the other hand in clear sight only about 120 miles away.During the lengthy attempt to contact Maintenance, we tried to reduce the fuel burn by starting a slow descent. We reduced the left engine to idle and made small thrust adjustments with the right engine to maintain a descent rate of about 1,000 FPM to slow down the increase of the imbalance. According to our calculations, if we were to continue to [destination], we were going to burn the left tank well below the 2,000 LBS or we were considering an idle descent into [the nearby airport] keeping the fuel level in the left tank above emergency fuel level.Additionally, we had to consider that [destination] was landing north with gusty conditions, which would have required an additional fuel burn. After finally getting everyone in the loop, we had reached an altitude of about FL240 and were just about 80 miles out of [diversion airport]. The mutual decision was made to divert. An emergency was declared and we pulled up to the gate with 2,400 LBS in the left tank and 3,700 LBS in the right tank.				B737-700 Captain reported apparent fuel leak in the left tank that led to a decision to declare an emergency and divert to nearest suitable airport.

The visibility was good and there was light precipitation falling; rain with a few snowflakes. The outside air temperature was above freezing. The First Officer and I were very diligent about whether any precipitation was adhering to the aircraft and it most definitely was not. As we were sitting in position, Tower stated 'Company XXX, new ATIS calling light snow pellets. Fly heading 081, cleared for takeoff.' I released brakes and we took off uneventfully. The question that arose is whether we should have declined takeoff clearance and de-iced or if we were okay to press on with the takeoff. It is not a question of safety, because there was minimal precipitation and we most definitely had a clean aircraft. Since we were in position on the runway, we did not bring up the new ATIS on ACARS because it would have been inappropriate at that time.... Our concern is not whether our actions were safe, because we definitely had a clean aircraft. Our question is whether at the time with the limited information we had, should we have taken off or de-iced? It was obvious looking out the windows that the precipitation was light and not adhering to the aircraft or any outside structures. It was a very light mist falling and the OAT was above freezing. I believe if it was stated by ATC as 'ice pellets' and I hadn't yet started pushing up the power, the correct action would have been to clear the runway and have Type 1 and Type 4 sprayed on the clean aircraft. While commencing the takeoff and getting the short, verbal ATIS from Tower about 'light snow pellets,' I believe we were correct in our actions.				When cleared for takeoff, B737-700 flight crew was informed by Tower of an ATIS change to 'light snow pellets.' After an uneventful takeoff, flight crew questioned the legality of taking off without applying Type 1 and Type 4 fluid to the aircraft.

They asked if we had the field in sight and we confirmed that we did have it in sight and they cleared us direct SHAND and the visual 25L. The First Officer asked for 5,000 FT, the published altitude for SHAND. He continued his gradual descent to 5,000 FT and maintained 250 KTS, intending to slow down at 5,000 FT to help expedite our late arrival into LAS. It was a clear night with a half moon, I believe. At no point did I consider terrain separation an issue. However, on our dog leg to final, I noticed after we landed that on the [Commercial chart] page it does show a rising terrain with a top elevation of 3,738 FT just south of LARRE. I believe this is what we flew over and my guess is that the rapidly rising terrain is what caused the EGPWS to activate the 'Too Low, Terrain' call. He disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles and climbed to approximately 5,600 FT, again with everything in sight (airport, city lights, terrain). I do believe the long day we had, being 2 hours late and it being after XA00am also played a factor.				A320 Captain reported receiving a EGPWS Terrain alert on night visual approach into LAS while being vectored off arrival routing. Fatigue was mentioned as a factor.

We were originally cleared to MCO via the PIGLT4 RNAV STAR, direct [to] OCF [thence via the OCF] transition. Shortly thereafter, we were re-cleared direct OTK and remainder of PIGLT 4 arrival. After about 2-3 minutes, the Controller inquired if we were direct to OTK. Initially I replied we were but after review of our course, it did not quite make sense. The Captain reprogrammed direct to OTK which required a 15-20 degree heading change and resulted with OTK as the only active waypoint. We had followed the normal verification process before the original execution, however, somehow the selection of several abeam points between our present position and OTK resulted in a course error that went unnoticed.Sometimes the selection of abeam points are so close together, it can cloud the actual 'cleared to' fix. A more thorough and careful review and verification on my part is essential!		Next time I would expand the map to a larger scale to verify the new course change in addition to checking the course in our normal procedures.		When ATC changed their clearance from direct to OCF, cleared for the PIGLT RNAV STAR to cleared to OTK for the STAR the flight crew of a B737-800 failed to confirm their reprogramming of the FMC and a track deviation, caught by ATC, resulted.

After several minutes of level flight, the oil quantity remained low, fluctuating between two to three quarts. Other engine parameters were within limits. We decided to return to our departure airport. We declared an emergency with ATC and requested an ILS to Runway XX. I briefed the flight attendants and informed the passengers. Our jumpseat rider was very helpful. I asked him to notify the company and request an arrival gate. During this time, the engine oil quantity went to zero followed by the oil pressure going out of limits. Following the QRH, we shut down the left engine. Completed appropriate checklists and flew an uneventful ILS, landing and rollout on Runway XX. We had CFR personnel scan our left engine after landing, then taxied to the gate. Single engine flight time was approximately 10 minutes.		The Captain flew an ILS to Runway XX in VFR conditions. During the approach, the flight director steering bars were not working correctly, but the localizer and glideslope pointers were displaying correct information and we were VFR with the runway in sight, so we disregarded the flight director and continued the approach. Maintenance subsequently reported finding the Fuel-Oil Heat Exchanger leaking from the drain.		The flight crew of a B737-800 shut down the left engine shortly after takeoff due to loss of oil and oil pressure.  They declared an emergency and returned uneventfully to their departure airport.

Some choppiness and minor airspeed deviations had occurred when feet dry over North Carolina - suspected mountain wave activity. Conditions smoothed when feet wet. Wind from the west at 190+/- KTS; then sudden windshear +/- 30 KTS. Had to throttle right back (<50 percent N1) to keep from over speed, needed to descend. Declared emergency to descend to FL380 because I could not maintain altitude and airspeed. During the descent the wind speed fluctuated wildly between 120 and 190 KTS. This caused 'coffin corner ' to be observed about 3 times during the extreme wind speed fluctuations; the min spread was about 5 KTS and the wide spread was about 50 KTS on the airspeed tape. I was busy locked onto the 'ball and needle' while coaxing the plane down to FL380 and while waiting for the engines to spool back up to the normal N1 range for cruise. After 3 to 4 minutes, regained complete control of altitude, airspeed, and N1. Continued toward OZENA fix. Then contacted Dispatch/Maintenance after clearing the emergency condition with ATC. Concurrence between PIC, MC, and Dispatch that extreme turbulence was not encountered which would have required an inspection of the aircraft by MC. Upon later debrief with the lead F/A while enroute after the discussion with Dispatch and MC, learned that the passengers experienced nothing more than the choppiness of the occurrence, and didn't seem concerned, but that the flight attendants had recognized something unusual had occurred. Then continued to destination without further incident.				B737-700 Captain reports encountering mountain wave like conditions at FL400 over the western Atlantic. Large airspeed excursions are reported and altitude cannot be maintained. An emergency is declared until clear of the conditions then canceled.

Waiting on the runway for takeoff clearance, Captain set the parking brake and transferred control of aircraft. Takeoff clearance was given, parking brake released, power set to 50 percent N1. As the aircraft started to roll and needed ground directional control, both First Officer rudder pedals pushed all the way to their full travel together with no directional or braking control. Checked that the adjustment handle was in the stowed/locked position. Pedals still failed. Transferred aircraft control to Captain, he rejected the takeoff, slowed the aircraft to exit at the first taxiway. Speed at occurrence was approximately 30 knots. Stopped on the taxiway, confirmed that the locking mechanism had failed and returned to gate. Mechanical failure of the First Officer's rudder pedals. Other than a personal setting adjustment at the gate, there is no procedure to check First Officer's rudder pedals for proper movement and use. Failure was not found until actual use for ground directional/flight is required. I would suggest adding a procedure to check First Officer rudder pedals for proper movement and use.				An A320 series First Officer rudder pedals traveled full forward together with the handle in the stowed/locked position so the Captain rejected the takeoff and returned to the gate.

When cleared by Albuquerque Center to 'Descend via the EAGUL FIVE RNAV arrival, Runway 08 transition, Phoenix Sky Harbor altimeter three zero two six,' I verified that the pilot flying had set 7,000 in the FCU after which I received an arrival briefing. I monitored the aircraft's compliance with the arrival routing, altitude constraints and airspeed restrictions while acknowledging comments from the pilot flying. I had preset each anticipated radio frequency and responded promptly to each radio call addressed to us; however, my attention was diverted from monitoring tasks within the flight deck due to traffic vigilance. Unbeknownst to me, perhaps between EAGUL and HOMRR, the FMGC had been modified from Runway 08 to Runway 26, perhaps while I was communicating with Albuquerque Center and Phoenix Approach Control during the handoff. The first indication that we were off course occurred when the approach controller asked if we were on the Runway 08 transition. I acknowledged in the affirmative, however, when I saw that Runway 26 was, in fact, displayed in the FMGC and determined that we had passed the HOMRR Intersection, I endeavored to communicate to the Controller that we were now aware of the error. The aircraft was descending through 8,800 FT in the managed mode as verified by the FMA. Immediately prior to keying the side stick 'push-to-talk' comm switch in order to convey my urgent message, the Controller instructed us to turn right to a heading of two one zero and maintain nine thousand. I acknowledged the clearance while the PF set the heading on the FCU to 210, however, when the pilot flying did not also promptly reset the FCU altitude from 7,000 to 9,000, I immediately alerted the pilot flying. When the pilot flying did not respond to my second alert, I ensured that the FCU altitude hold selector had commanded the aircraft to maintain the present altitude and advised the pilot flying that we must immediately climb to 9,000. I then advised the Controller that we could proceed directly to GEENO and resume the arrival. He immediately and very politely responded by clearing us to 'proceed direct GEENO, maintain 9,000 and resume the EAGUL FIVE arrival.' I thanked him and reminded myself to remain 'in the green.' I informed the pilot flying to reset the FCU altitude to 7,000 and, now fully aware of the adrenaline rushing through my circulatory system, easily maintained an elevated level of situational awareness.I believe the cause of the event to have been poor CRM.				An A320 flight crew descending on the EAGUL RNAV STAR to PHX discovered the wrong runway transition inside of HOMRR was programmed in their active route.

I was pilot flying and the Captain the pilot not flying. We had been cleared and descended to cross FUZZY at 16,000 FT and 250 KTS when I noticed, several miles outside of IPUMY, that we hadn't heard from ATC in a while and were rapidly becoming too high to comply with the 11,000 FT and 230 KTS crossing at IPUMY (we still had not yet been given the 'descend via' clearance). When we received no response to our inquiry to ATC we went back to the last assigned frequency and were told to switch to another frequency. When the Captain checked in and advised of our altitude we were cleared to descend to 10,000 FT and to delete the restriction at IPUMY. I selected open descent but, before we leveled off at 10,000 FT, ATC cleared us to 'descend via' the SUNST RNAV arrival. I selected 8,000 FT in the altitude but forgot to push 'altitude' for a managed descent. I announced the next crossing, which was NIPZO at 9,000 FT, but neither of us realized we were still in Open descent. Shortly after passing 9,000 FT we received traffic advisory and both of us focused on this. The traffic was 2,500 FT below us, but this also contributed to our not noticing the altitude deviation. We realized we had gone approximately 500 FT below the NIPZO crossing when ATC advised us. I deselected the autopilot and climbed back up to 9,000 FT and no other disruptions occurred. Several factors led to this event: the confusion and distraction from the lost communications, receiving a non-standard/out-of-the-ordinary clearance to descend to 10,000 FT rather than to 'descend via the SUNST RNAV arrival,' and being distracted with a traffic advisory, all which took place during a high workload environment.To prevent this from happening again, I will be more alert and prepared to confirm automation when a change in descent clearance is given other than what we are used to receive in a multiple crossing RNAV arrival. I would also be quicker to query ATC when I notice approaching our next descent point rather than waiting to query after well crossing it and being further behind and being put in a catch up mode.		[No substantive additional information was provided by the secondary narrative.]		A temporary loss of communication with ATC and non standard clearances while flying the SUNST RNAV STAR to LAS resulted in two deviations from charted crossing restrictions for the reporting A320 flight crew.

The ECL [Electronic Check List] for LANDING ELEVATION UNKNOWN appeared and we complied with this short checklist. This was NOT the problem. We got one autopilot working and both FMSs came back on so we reloaded the flight plan and [when complete] were a maximum of 5 NM to the right of course. We aggressively returned to course while we used SATCOM to call Maintenance Control and Operations. Maintenance advised they had already noted that we appeared to have lost our AIMS [integrated Airplane Information Management System] which controlled all/most of the lost items. I determined we were safely flying and navigating [well enough] to continue the mission. Gander SELCAL'd us and asked for a position report as one of the many things we lost was the CPDLC. We explained we were experiencing MINOR electrical problems and to please give us one minute to compile and provide the report.		This caused us to lose our magenta line on our Navigation Display (ND). We saw we initially had a loss of VNAV and LNAV flight director commands as the autopilot basically went to a pitch and power setting.We tried changing autopilots as well as changing our FMC control (from left to right), and this got us our magenta line up and running. We determined we got no more than 3.5 miles off course centerline while this took place, and there were no traffic conflicts near us. We continued on with the flight as we were now back with full navigational capability.		A B777-200 flight crew suffered the partial loss of one AMIS (Aircraft Management Information System) enroute over the Atlantic and a minor track deviation resulted before they could re-establish navigation and control functions.

We looked at the cabin pressure gauge and noticed the cabin rate was climbing at approximately 1,800 fpm and the cabin altitude was slowly climbing as well. At about that time, the Flight Attendant called the flight deck to ask if we heard a noise. Over the interphone we could hear a whining noise and could still feel our ears popping with the cabin climb rate still climbing at 1,800 fpm. We donned our oxygen masks, established communications with each other, and pulled out the QRH and referenced the Cabin Altitude Warning/Abnormal Pressurization Checklist. We declared an emergency with Center and coordinated an emergency descent down to 11,000 feet MSL and requested routing back to [departure airport]. As we descended, we continued in the checklist to completion. We requested a descent to 10,000 feet MSL so that we could remove our oxygen masks and continue to assess our situation. At 10,000 feet MSL, cabin pressurization had returned to normal so we removed our oxygen masks and discussed our options including returning to [departure airport]. The Captain communicated with the flight attendants and passengers. We concluded that since the pressurization was under control and after confirming with the flight attendants that there was no obvious damage in the cabin that caused the depressurization that the best course of action would be to return while burning off fuel to avoid an overweight landing. We notified Dispatch of our intentions, ensured that all checklists were completed, and communications were covered. After approximately one hour of holding, we returned and landed uneventfully and conducted a normal taxi to the gate. As we are still unclear what actually caused the depressurization, we can't speculate if there was anyone responsible for the incident or determine if there was any way to prevent it.		Approximately three minutes after level off, the First Officer and I heard and felt what sounded to me like a loud lavatory flush (kind of a muffled bang and flutter). We also felt a slight bump in cabin pressurization. So we looked at the pressurization panel and noticed the cabin climb rate indicator reading approximately 1,200 fpm climb, the cabin altitude indicator reading 8,000 feet and climbing slowly, and the cabin differential pressure indicator reading normal. The AUTO FAIL and ALTN lights never illuminated throughout this event. The outflow valve indicator indicated full closed until descent for landing (normal indications).Given the pressurization loss we experienced, I suspected the seal around the forward entry door. I told Maintenance at the gate that the forward entry door would be a good thing to check out.		B737-700 flight crew reported loss of cabin pressure shortly after reaching cruise altitude of FL370. They declared an emergency, descended, and returned to departure airport.

Initially cleared for PURRL RNAV STAR to DEN, we set up for Runway 35R since they didn't give us a runway and we had used 35R on an earlier trip. We briefed the arrival and approach to 35R and then had following changes:1) Slow to 250 from published 280.2) Given Runway 35L (changed box and briefed).3) Given ZPLYN1 Arrival and 35L (changed box and briefed).4) Told to accelerate to 280.5) Switched controllers and told to hold 210.Several of these changes required total [reprogramming of our route on the FMS]. Still a ways out the RVR dropped to 1,400 for blowing fog. The minimums for our CAT I aircraft (no HUD) were RVR 1,800. However, we had had 35R in sight for 40 miles so we asked for a visual to 35R with the field in sight. Approach Control said he couldn't do it because the field was IFR, but he gave us a heading and cleared us for the ILS 35R. (We were way out as all this was happening.) He said RVR for 35R was 2500/6000/6000. Tower then recleared us to land 35R. We flew the ILS 35R as previously briefed to an uneventful visual landing. As we cleared the runway, Tower told the guy behind us RVR has dropped to 1,400 approach end. He said he needed 1,800 and Tower said to wait as it just came up to 1,800 and then quickly to 6,000. My concern is whether we had the reported visibility required for the ILS even though we were visual the whole way. My First Officer said Tower told us RVR was 2500/6000/6000. He did not file a report because he is sure of this and is positive we stayed within the rules.I don't like the new RNAV arrivals that are very complex. It takes a long time to load and check them. The many restrictions--accompanied by numerous airspeed, arrival and runway changes--make them extremely challenging. We commented that they should attach a company safety form to the flight plan. Tower and Approach Control guys were very helpful.				Great coordination between ATC and the flight crew of a B737-700 salvaged an uneventful landing at DEN during rapidly changing airport weather due to blowing fog. Programming changes to complex RNAV STARs was cited as a contributing factor to the flight crew's workload.

I directed the First Officer to run the QRH. After the read-respond-do process, the #2 Generator switch was bussed back on. Instead of coming back on the attempt actually tripped off the #1 Generator, leaving no generator powering the electrical system (down to battery power). The crew then ran the Dual Generator Failure checklist and started the APU, however, initially it would not bus to the L or R side. After some delay and ATC vectors, the crew was able to get APU to bus to the left side. Upon regaining sufficient systems and instruments. We ceased checklists and troubleshooting and elected to land with the Captain flying the ILS. An emergency was declared with Approach Control and some priority vectors were offered to final. After landing, the flight was uneventful.I suggest that we look at QRH Electrical SOURCE OFF procedures and possibly add a bullet to check volts/amps on the disconnected circuit prior to attempting to re-bus the generator. If out of tolerance readings are found, consideration should be given to 'NOT' attempt to bus the failed system. As in our case, it made a minor problem major in nature. It appeared that the tripped generator actually kicked the good generator off-line as well when we tried to re-bus it.		[No substantive additional information was provided in the secondary narrative.]		A B737-700 flight crew ended up on battery power only when one bus failed and the second tripped off when the crew attempted to return the failed system to the bus.  They ultimately were able to regain one functional bus and made and uneventful landing.

We were cleared for takeoff prior to reaching the runway hold short line.  The Before Takeoff checklist was completed and the takeoff was initiated without stopping on the runway.  After the '80 Knots' call out, the master warning illuminated.  First Officer alerted then of a ELEC1 HYD OVRHT annunciator illuminated on the forward overhead panel.  I proceeded to abort the takeoff using the new procedure except no thrust reverse was activated due to the length of the runway and the extremely effective and immediate response of the RTO braking system.  The rejected takeoff was initiated at approximately 95 knots and a TOW of approximately 143,000 lbs.  We requested to be directed to a holding place on the airport, for brake cooling and time to troubleshoot the problem.  After QRH was accomplished and brake cooling chart was verified, we requested a gate/ramp spot to allow for Maintenance to reach the aircraft as well as to establish communication with Maintenance Control via cellphone.  The issue was MEL'd by me with Maintenance Control via cellphone and the aircraft inspection completed by a local Maintenance representative.				B737-700 Captain reports rejecting a takeoff at 95 knots after a master warning illuminated indicating a ELEC1 HYD OVRHT annunciator illuminated.

We looked at our pressurization panel and noticed that the cabin was around 9,000 feet and the vertical rate on the cabin was above 500 feet per minute. We had no indication on the Flight Deck that the cabin was indeed rising. We decided to put the packs in high mode while we reviewed the checklist. It took just a few seconds with the packs in high mode for the cabin to start coming back down and stabilizing. We decided to leave the packs in high mode until FL180 when we performed our descent checklist. The aircraft was taken out of service upon our arrival. Hopefully they can find out what the issue is with the pressurization system on this aircraft.				B737-700 Captain reported cabin climbed to 9,000 feet, so packs were put in high flow mode to control pressurization.

Captain was flying, descending via Tyssn 3 arrival into LAS... Captain said it was his first leg into LAS after many years.... Descending in VNAV between CEJAY and KADDY, aircraft started to get high on the profile after transition altitude, which I called out. At some point the Captain switched to Level Change to catch up. I dialed in 12,000 in the Altitude Alert window, the next restriction. We both were using iPads per new procedures, though I did have paper charts out as backup. While this was going on, Captain's iPad auto locked, blanking his chart screen. I called out that we needed to level at 12,000. It started to overshoot and we may have gone up to two hundred feet below 12,000 (11,800) and returned to 12,000 in only seconds. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The LA Center Controller did not mention it and subsequently switched us to approach.While late night flying and the Captain's first trip into LAS may have been contributing factors, his iPad blanking at just the right time seemed to unsettle him a bit as he mentioned in later discussion. Better awareness among the pilots about ways to prevent the iPad from doing this may help the iPad transition to be more successful. If the iPad requires a passcode to show the charts again, it can be nearly impossible to quickly bring the screen back up, especially in turbulence. That segment of the star doesn't allow a lot of room for error due to a 'get down and slow down' requirement. I felt like I was aware of what was going on and thought 12,000 would be captured without overshoot, but we did go slightly below.				B737-800 flight crew momentarily descended 200 FT below altitude restriction on LAS Arrival while in Level Change mode. Loss of chart display on Captain's Ipad cited as a factor.

One hour later Maintenance decided to MEL the lav waste level indicator and we began boarding again. With doors closed and ready to push 'A' Flight Attendant reported seat 9E slowly reclined and would not stay upright. With Maintenance back on board and unable to fix seat, another MEL was added resulting in the nonrev mother and her three children being forced off the full flight. Pushed 2:25 hours late. 1 hour 29 into flight, 3:40 from our destination. Flight attendants reported Lav Inop Light illuminated on Aft Flight Attendant Panel and all lavs would not flush. Dispatcher wanted us to press on to our destination. With lines to the lavs and urine and feces filling all lav bowls we turned back and preferred our departure airport as it was closer, but Dispatch said go to an airport with more maintenance. Landed after 4:18 block hours with all lavs filled to the brim with urine and feces. I had to urinate in an aft lav sink prior to top of descent. We were put up at the hotel on a reduced rest with all the irate passengers from our flight after their 2:25 delayed flight with toilets filled to the brim with urine and fecal matter and the subsequent divert back taking 4:18. Once inside the terminal an irate passenger started yelling at the Captain, 'Shame on you! Shame on you for promising to get us to our destination and that we were in a good working airplane!' Upon arriving at the hotel there were passengers lined up in the lobby and we could not get to our rooms without being questioned in the elevators about the last awful six plus hours. There was no food available at the hotel after 9pm 'due to the economy' and the air conditioning system in room could not keep a constant temperature resulting in me waking up three times throughout the shortened time I had in my hotel room. A Flight Attendant complained to me that there was no way she was walking to the only open establishment for food (a sushi restaurant) three blocks away after dark with the homicide that occurred there three months ago only to be grilled by irate passengers. Three things really need to be addressed here. One, dispatchers need to realize that we are not in a nice warm room with a spacious and clean working bathroom right down the hall, and there are over 150 of us up here for hours at a time. Also, they need to realize we do not have SATCOM, so when they send a release via ACARS it can take up to an hour, sometimes more, for us to receive it, if at all. Second, it is totally unacceptable to be lodged in the same hotel as irate passengers from the same flight and having to be confined to your room without room service when so many more hotel options are available, actually offer food and are sanitary and safe. Recommend creating a contingency plan for canceled flights that ensures the mob and flight crew are not staying at the same hotel. This will help diffuse the tension during check-in, not upset the passengers (further) and not put the crew in an even more stressful situation. And finally, it is absolutely disgraceful that we are still forced to stay in such an unsanitary, unsafe hotel with three strip clubs, transients, dumpsters, syringes, liquor stores all on the same block less than 150 yards from the front door, add to that a homicide three months ago, no food available in the evening in the hotel, continued noise complaints and rooms consistently having hair and dirt in the sheets. While this hotel property and the surrounding area were probably nice in the 80's, neighborhoods do change and with it comes decay. Simple, it is undeniably low rent, strip clubs, pawn shops, massage parlors, smoke shops, liquor stores, filthy alleys and the people that frequent these types of businesses. These are not job perks I am addressing, but duties, requirements and conditions that impact how wesafely perform our job.				A B737-800's lavatory flush system failed in flight so the Captain elected to divert because the lavatories were overflowing and they were over three hours from their destination. The Crew was put into a hotel with irate passengers.

Shortly thereafter we got a Master Caution and Engine light, and I noticed both EECs were in the alternate mode. The First Officer continued flying as he had good instruments, but we had discrepancies between airspeed IVSI and altimeter indications and the IAS disagree light was on. The QRH was accomplished for EEC in the alternate mode, and we returned to the departure airport for an overweight landing. Landing was uneventful except as we configured for landing we got intermittent stick shaker indications with the Captain's airspeed tape reading approximately 45 KIAS. The cause was an Aircraft Component Malfunction.				A B737-900 EECs, Master Caution, Speed Tape, IVSI, altimeters and engine light showed malfunctioning systems so the Captain transferred control to the First Officer whose instruments were more accurate and the flight returned to land.

First Officer and I began final approach segment from 3,000 feet and 10 miles from runway to assure long stable approach.With auto brakes set at MAX, touch down was firm but not hard. Auto brakes gradually applied MAX brake pressure, and stopped aircraft on center line. Requested AARF personnel to inspect aircraft, paying particular attention to wheels, brakes and tires. Approach speed target was 180 KTS. No problems found, preceded to gate. First Officer and I inspected exterior of aircraft and found left flap up and right flap down approximately 2' down from flush with wing, as indicated on flap gauge. Inspected brakes and wheels and temperatures seemed to be normal.We had communication with AARF only through relay from Tower staff. Spoke with airport safety coordinator after this event and he said they would solve that issue.				B737-800 flight crew experienced a flap asymmetry, ran the checklist and landed without incident.

Initially, we were at FL320, in and out of turbulence. We descended to FL280 for a better ride. Shortly after level cruise, we felt a jolt, like wake turbulence. I saw no aircraft on TCAS that could have been the cause. So we didn't think anything more about it. A little while thereafter, we heard a banging noise, and we looked at the engine gauges but could not determine which engine might have been the cause. I turned the right throttle off, thinking that might have been it. We retarded the throttle slightly to see if that would identify the cause. It ran smoothly, so we re-engaged the right autothrottle. As the engine was coming up, we got the bang again and noticed the fluctuation on the left engine. At that point, we turned off the left autothrottle and retarded the left engine. At that point, we decided we needed to run the checklist for that engine. We declared an emergency and asked for vectors to destination. We thought that was the best option because thunderstorms were at the field at our alternate and also between us and the alternate. We followed all checklists and accomplished a safe landing. We asked for fire trucks to meet us on landing, they checked out the aircraft, and we continued our taxi to the gate.		We were approximately 120 NM northeast of destination at FL280 when we heard an unidentified rumbling noise followed shortly thereafter by a second one. We suspected it was a compressor stall be didn't know for sure which engine. After another short descent and thrust addition another stall occurred and a rise in EGT was identified on the left engine. The Captain ran the appropriate non-normal checklist and elected to leave the engine running at idle power, the First Officer flew the aircraft and I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to advise them of our situation. Maintenance checked the down link information from the aircraft but did not notice any exceeded limits. Dispatch advised of some thunderstorm activity passing through and suggested we vector around to the northwest for an approach to the southeast. I informed the flight attendants and passengers that we had an engine problem that was now stable and we would be landing shortly. The Captain declared an emergency, we completed all our checklists, and I reviewed the landing distance required with a single engine. We deviated around some moderate rain and were vectored for an approach. After landing we taxied off the runway and were inspected by emergency crew. No visible damage or indication of fire was noted and so we shut the engine down and taxied to the gate.		B777 flight crew experiences compressor stalls in the left engine during initial descent for landing. The engine is allowed to continue running and an uneventful landing at destination ensues.

We asked her to keep us posted and report if it gets any worse. Approximately 15 minutes later, we had another call from a Flight Attendant reporting 'excessive pressure leak sound' coming from both doors 1L and 1R! We checked the pressurization system and everything was operating normally. Contacted Maintenance Control and were told there is no history of that problem on this aircraft and suggested we put some wet towels around the door to see if that helps with the hissing sound. We then received numerous calls from the flight attendants complaining about 'dizziness and bad air quality.' At this time I decided to go back and have a look at the situation, since it seemed to be escalating. I found only door 1L making an extremely loud pressure leak noise. The rest of the doors were normal. Walking back to the cabin, I found one of the flight attendants using O2 and most of them were complaining about the air quality. Two of them were complaining about a popping sensation in their ears and dizziness. I tried to reassure them that after talking to Maintenance Control and inspecting the doors personally, other than the loud hissing noise coming from the door seal, there was no other safety concerns and all the aircraft systems were operating normally and that I, myself after having spent about ten minutes in the cabin, did not feel any abnormalities in the cabin air quality, and informed them that at this point our decision is to continue to destination. I returned to the cockpit. We tried to climb in an attempt to reduce door 1L's hissing sound and also turned the recirc fans off to improve the cabin air quality. we were about an hour 30 minutes into the flight when the Lead Flight Attendant, called the cockpit and said that among the few flight attendants still complaining of dizziness, one of them was also complaining about chest pain. I asked her to come to the cockpit and we called Dispatch. We explained our situation to them and asked for a phone patch to our contract medical service. I asked the Lead to describe the Flight Attendant's symptoms to the to the medical service personnel. At this point we were certain that continuing to our filed destination was not the best course of action and depending on how bad the Flight Attendant was feeling we either would have to land at the nearest suitable airport or return to the departure airport. I asked the Lead to go back and ask the Flight Attendant if he felt his situation required a [diver] landing, or he felt OK enough to return and the difference would be about an hour. The Lead Flight Attendant said that his condition was not bad enough to require an immediate landing, but that he could not continue all the way to the destination. So, after consulting with the medical personnel, we decided to return and requested paramedics and an in-flight supervisor to meet the flight. We contacted Maintenance Control again to see if we should land over weight or dump. We were advised to dump, so we dumped. Fuel at the start of dumping +/- 135,000 LBS, landed with 51,000 LBS dumped +/- 80,000 LBS I would also like to mention the following two points: 1) Once we were heading back, we advised the Lead Flight Attendant that paramedics will be meeting the Flight Attendant that was complaining of chest pain. To our surprise, her response was that he is feeling fine now and that won't be necessary! But we told her to instruct that Flight Attendant not to disembark without the OK of the paramedics. After arrival paramedics examined the Flight Attendant, gave him an all OK and asked him if he wanted an EKG. The Flight Attendant said he felt OK. He was reminded he had to make a decision on taking the EKG and if he did not feel that he needed it, he would have to sign a form for them. He decided to sign the form. This was all in presence of the In-flight Supervisor. 2) The next day, coming back to our base, the First Officer was sitting next to a passenger who happened to have been on our previous flight and was a medical doctor. The passenger indicated that since she had seen one of the Flight Attendants on O2, she had informed one of the Flight Attendants that she was a medical doctor and asked if she could be of any help. The response to her had been: 'no thank you!'		[Narrative 2 contained no additional information.]		A B777's L1 and R1 doors produced a loud hissing noise in flight while indicating normal pressurization. One Flight Attendant temporarily complained of chest pain but recovered after the flight returned to the departure station.

Captain notified Maintenance Control (MOC) through early alert, and we landed without incident. On arrival at the gate, we did notice an odor and the Captain then proceeded to write it up. I then left the aircraft as the Captain was finishing the paperwork, and told the oncoming First Officer about the incident. While waiting for the van and Captain curbside, I was called from Dispatch (OCC) to ask the Captain to call MOC, and told them he wasn't there yet, but I would. I notified him to call MOC, he said he would. Then during the van ride I called Crew Scheduling to see about a later DH, and once again I was asked to have the Captain call MOC. I told the individual that we were in the van with civilians and it might be better to talk to the Captain at the hotel instead of in front of the flying public. I then passed on the second request to the Captain and he said he would call them at the hotel.				A320 flight attendants reported an odor during descent for landing which the flight crew also detected after parking at the gate, resulting in a maintenance log entry.

ATC directed maintain 3,000 FT until localizer capture. Got LOC capture outside OTSEE (3000A). At OTSEE, Captain rolled altitude to 2,400 FT, which was for ZATAR (2400A). At approximately 2,500 FT and one to two miles from ZATAR just about to capture 2,400 FT, we received a Caution Obstacle. Executed a go-around and then back to an ILS to same runway. This time we captured glideslope at 3,000 FT. It was an uneventful approach and landing. There is a Tower at just under 400 FT AGL, 1,352 FT MSL, just short of ZATAR. Even though we complied with the approach altitude requirements, the combination of our altitude and descent rate must have caused the Caution Obstacle alert. This is my best guess. Next time around we captured the glideslope at 3,000 FT and the approach went fine.		We received a Caution Obstacle alert on approach into OMA Runway 14R. We were IMC and descending to 2,400 FT which was the next altitude on the approach. We had VOR LOC capture and had been cleared for the approach. The previous fix altitude was 3,000 FT and we had crossed at or above that before continuing our descent. The autothrottles were engaged and we were in level change with landing gear and flaps 15. At about 2,500 FT we got the alert and executed a missed approach. We reviewed the chart again, noted the obstacle, but did not know why we got the alert. We were vectored around for a second approach. This time we intercepted the glideslope at 3,000 FT and descended on that. We landed uneventfully from the second approach. I don't have an answer for this because I am still not sure why we got the alert. I made sure we had the right altimeter setting, reviewed any applicable notes, and had no concerns from ATC. Not sure what I'm missing on this one.		B737 flight crew experiences an EGPWS caution during descent to 2,400 FT on the ILS 14R at OMA and a go around is initiated. On the second approach the glideslope is captured at 3,000 FT and the approach is completed without difficulty.

Airspeed during the climb was 320 KIAS due to overtaking traffic. Moderate airframe vibration of about 90-120 hertz was felt throughout the aircraft. Autopilot and auto-throttles were manually disconnected during the event. Decreasing both engine power and airspeed had little effect on the severity of the vibration. (All engine parameters were normal during the event and flight.) The event ceased about 45 seconds after it began. The flight attendants called the cockpit shortly after the event to report same. We leveled at FL330 and continued to troubleshoot the event. ECAM reports viewed via the FMGC maintenance reports, showed malfunctions on the THS and the right blue elevator servo. Dispatch was contacted through ACARS and then a phone patch. Maintenance Control input was also requested. The connection to Maintenance Control was never established. The First Officer and I decided with the unknown vibration and the flight control abnormality a prudent course of action would be a return to the nearest airport. (A divert airport was chosen due to known good weather [VMC and light winds], long runway configuration, maintainer support and passenger support.) We informed the flight attendants of the divert and declared an emergency with ATC and received expedited vectors to the airport. At 10,000 FT and 25 NM from the airport we configured and performed a modified controllability check. Landing was uneventful. CFR inspected the aircraft prior to taxi to the gate. At arrival aircraft Maintenance was debriefed on the event. Areas of concern: While the connection to Dispatch went well, the follow on connection to Maintenance Control was unsuccessful. As such we, the flight crew, were on our own in making the decision to divert. This lack of communication with Maintenance Control needs to be corrected as soon as possible.		While climbing out, we were told to keep our speed up. We were climbing out of 25,000 FT at 320 KTS when the aircraft started a very strong, fast rhythm vibration, shaking the entire airplane and lasting for about 20-30 seconds. It was unlike anything I had ever encountered. We immediately slowed and after a few seconds the vibration stopped. We had no ECAM's and all engine parameters were normal. We initially thought high speed buffet, or gear door, but it was a much different and stronger vibration than that. The flight attendants immediately called with concern and we told them we felt it too and were working on the problem. The Captain said he encountered something like this before and it was elevator buffet. The Captain then accessed the ECAM reports via the FMGC maintenance reports. He noted there were two elevator related faults. The Captain informed Dispatch that we had a flight control problem with two recorded errors and that without further information, we were considering returning to the nearest airport. We were unable to connect with Maintenance Control for further evaluation. With an unknown problem with a primary flight control, we elected to declare an emergency and return to the airport.		A320 flight crew climbing out of FL250 at 320 KTS experiences a very strong, fast rhythmic vibration, shaking the entire airplane and lasting for about 20-30 seconds. The vibration stops after the aircraft is slowed and the crew elects to divert to a suitable airport.

We were able to get nose wheel steering and normal brakes back through ECAM follow-up using the QRH. We briefed the flight attendants for a precautionary landing and made a PA to the passengers to explain our return. Finally, we advised ATC we would be able to land with normal braking, clear the runway and taxi to the gate.

We confirmed on the GEAR SYNOPTIC page the number 6 main gear tire was slowly losing pressure. It continued to lose pressure during the flight and stopped at 20 PSI. We completed all required checklists, and referenced all performance charts and limitations that were applicable to the condition. [Maintenance] was contacted to see if they could provide any history on other tire failures on the B777, and advise us on what to expect on landing and rollout. We were told the tire would most likely fail on the rollout. We planned our approach to this landing with that in mind. Dispatch was notified of the situation, and we requested they contact [destination ops] to plan for a possible 'aircraft unable to taxi' situation that would need stairs, buses, and a tug. I briefed the number 1 Flight Attendant on the situation, and the possible scenarios we might encounter on landing. We checked the weather along our route of flight; it was clear and forecast to remain VFR. I elected to increase our fuel burn above the flight plan figure to arrive with R+A fuel of 13,000 lbs, adding that to the 405,381 lbs gave us a landing weight of 418,400 lbs. At that landing weight with the current aircraft configuration, weight, weather, and performance penalties for 1 and possibly 2 brake failures provided a substantial safety margin. When Center was contacted we declared an emergency providing them with the required information, and briefed them on the situation and requested emergency equipment meet the plane. We flew a normal approach and landing, and rolled out using only reverse thrust down to turnoff speed, and then only minimal braking to bring the plane to a stop. A visual inspection of the gear and tire showed it to be intact, we slowly taxied to the gate. The cabin crew did an outstanding job of preparing the passengers and cabin for what turned out to be a very normal landing. I cannot say enough good things about my First Officer and relief pilot who made this scenario look easy with the way they handled it. This freed my time up to talk with the flight attendants, [Maintenance], Dispatch, ATC and keep the big picture in view allowing me to analyze the situation and make changes as needed.				B777-200 Captain reported receiving EICAS message TIRE PRESSURE after takeoff, alerting the flight crew of low pressure in a main gear tire. They coordinated with all applicable parties and landed normally at destination.

We stopped on the runway to have the ARFF personnel check the aircraft and then continued taxi to the gate.I had added additional fuel prior to departure, so we had sufficient fuel to properly accomplish a fairly complicated procedure, which required reference to sources outside of the QRH. If we had arrived with the originally scheduled fuel, we would have been very rushed trying to accomplish the emergency procedures. This underscores the fact that company arrival fuel is often marginal, leaving little room if the unexpected should occur.				B737-800 flaps stuck during extension. An emergency was declared and the flight landed uneventfully.

The initial filed portion of our route was for the MNZNO ONE Departure with the TXO transition. ABQ was departing Runway 8. The PDC matched our flight plan and cleared us to climb and maintain 9,000 feet MSL expecting our filed altitude within five minutes. We armed LNAV on the ground and took off with autothrottles. We were switched to Departure shortly after takeoff. On initial contact with departure we were cleared to climb via the MNZNO ONE. After engaging the autopilot and cleaning up, we armed VNAV and initially set 11,500 feet MSL in the altitude window. We then further reviewed the chart and set FL200 in the altitude window to comply with the routing instructions which are spelled out after initial climb but not visually depicted on the plan view of the departure.Just after we figured all that out we were given a vector off the SID at Center request. At that point we confirmed the vector and the altitude we were climbing to. The Controller verified the altitude and said, 'Hey, did your Company brief you guys on this new procedure?' We got into a bit of discussion and the Controller said some of our Crews (given the climb via clearance) are stopping the climb at 9,000 feet MSL which is bad since there is terrain to the east. Most of our Crews are stopping the climb at 11,500 feet MSL (the next depicted altitude on the plan view). He said very few Crews make it to FL200 without prompting. I feel like we briefed this procedure pretty well on the ground, but I must admit we missed briefing the top of the climb at FL200. We caught it in the air after setting 11,500 feet MSL in the altitude window and rereading the chart because we felt 11,500 feet MSL was a strange altitude. I realize RNAV climbs are going to be 'procedures of the future' and this exercise made me even more [aware of the need] to read the procedure all the way to the bottom. I know that we emphasize briefing the departure procedure and we did this on this departure. The thing that sticks out about this event is the rarity of the final altitude on the SID for the climb via NOT being visually depicted on the plan view. You must read all the way to the bottom of the procedure after the initial climb to see ATC expects FL200 in the Routing section. I think this is the first time I have seen this kind of clearance. It is extremely rare to actually fly the entire initial climb and routing description without an intervening clearance of some type. I am not used to doing it. On this SID there is the real possibility of impacting terrain if you screw up the altitudes. I think there is a teaching point here that can be made to Pilots in Flight Ops. I also believe there could be better visual depiction on the plan view of what ATC wants like a climb and maintain flag after MNZNO. Our Crew managed to make it through this procedure without prompting or actual ATC error but the potential did exist for us to screw it up.				A B737-700 First Officer reported confusion regarding the waypoint altitude restrictions on the MNZNO RNAV SID out of ABQ.  Departure advised that other flight crews had failed to comply with the restrictions and wondered if there had been adequate communication from their company as to the procedures requirements.

While the internal pane appeared to be holding, the outer pane had completely shattered and it was impossible to tell if the middle pane was damaged. We immediately leveled off and informed ATC. We completed the appropriate QRH procedure. The Captain coordinated with Dispatch and decided to divert to a nearby 	Maintenance station. All normal checklists were completed and a normal landing was made on Runway 24. The gross weight of the landing was 138,400 pounds which resulted in an overweight landing. We touched down at 129 knots in the touchdown zone and normal brake application began at 60 knots. During the arrival, we received a Dispatch message advising us to declare an emergency due to the overweight landing, which we did. However, after arrival at the gate, we reviewed the AOM, which indicates that an overweight landing by itself does not require an emergency to be declared.				A B737-700 Captain's siding window outer panel shattered during climb. After completing the QRH procedure the crew diverted to a nearby Maintenance station where a normal overweight landing was completed.

As we continued to climb and began to comply with procedures, BRAKE: AUTO BRAKE FAULT appeared. The captain elected to remain in US air space and hold as we began discussing problem with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The Captain kept flight attendants informed. Of particular interest was the status page which indicated the following 4 inoperative items: CAT 3 DUAL, Normal Brakes, Auto Brakes and Brake Sys 2. We were puzzled by Normal Brakes being inoperative given that only Brake Sys Fault 2 was on the upper ECAM. Maintenance Control could not decipher why we had that indication. If normal brakes were inoperative, shouldn't we also have a BRAKE SYS 1 FAULT? We elected to return, declare an emergency and operate under the assumption that we would decelerate with ALTERNATE brakes. We landed without incident using ALTERNATE brakes. I monitored and called out pressures from the triple brake indicator as the Captain decelerated. NWS worked so we taxied to the gate.		After printing paperwork for flight, reviewed maintenance history and Open Inbound Defect Reports. Received call from Dispatcher stating that he turned down aircraft for brake history. Waited in operations until notified that Maintenance replaced BSCU and cleared aircraft for departure. Completed normal preflight and pre-departure checks. On climb passing 7,000 feet BRK SYS 2 FAULT and BRK AUTO BRK Failure Ecams annunciated. Completed ECAM procedures and reviewed Status page indicating Inop Systems: CAT 3 DUAL, NORM BRK, AUTO BRK, BRK SYS 2. After brief discussion and review of maintenance history, contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control through ACARS and voice. It was determined and agreed that continuing to destination with current aircraft status was not feasible. Requested delaying vectors and holding from Center. Maintenance Control stated that the ECAM/Status information did not make sense and with current fault information, could not determine the exact aircraft failures/condition. Declared an emergency, briefed the flight attendants on aircraft status and divert plans, and announced to passengers the plan for a return. After consultation with Dispatch and Maintenance Control, it was determined that the worst case scenario for landing would be alternate brakes, no anti skid, and no nose wheel steering. Landing performance and procedures for landing with alternate brakes and possible failure of nose wheel steering was reviewed and briefed. A normal ILS approach was flown by the Captain in visual conditions. At touchdown it was determined that braking was alternate yellow system braking with fluctuating pressure indicated on Brake Pressure Gauge. First Officer called pressures during rollout and remained below 500 psi during rollout. After determining nose wheel steering availability exited runway and stopped on taxiway for systems status check. Normal taxi and shutdown.		A320 flight crew accepts an aircraft after a BSCU change and during climb passing 7,000 feet BRK SYS 2 FAULT and BRK AUTO BRK Failure ECAM's annunciated.  Status Page indicates NORM BRK, AUTO BRK, BRK SYS 2 have faults and the crew elects to return to the departure airport. After landing braking is via Alternate Brakes and the nose wheel steering is functional.

Nearing FL300, we noticed that the pressurization page had popped up on the systems display. The systems page showed the cabin altitude pulsating green and indicating a cabin altitude of 8,900 feet. The cabin vertical speed was showing a climb of about 500 fpm. There were no other system faults indicated. We decided to expedite our descent in case the situation deteriorated further. We asked for and received an immediate clearance to 12,000 feet initially and then 10,000 feet shortly thereafter from Center. As we descended, the cabin altitude continued to drift higher at 700-800 fpm. When the indicated cabin altitude reached 10,000 feet we put our oxygen masks on and established communications. This was followed shortly thereafter by the master warning and ECAM CAB PR EXCESS CAB ALT around FL250. We completed the ECAM and also did the Emergency Descent QRH. Since we already had our clearance to 10,000 feet and were quite busy at the time, we did not declare an emergency or squawk 7700. We still had no indications of any other systems anomalies or faults at this point. The pressurization page showed the outflow valve to be in a normal position and CPC SYS1 showed green. I checked the bleed system display page and everything indicated normal outputs on it. Nevertheless, the indicated cabin altitude continued to drift higher as we descended. Passing below FL200, I selected the pressurization control to manual and tried moving the outflow valve towards closed. The outflow valve was near the first tick mark on the displayed range of movement. As I moved the outflow valve towards the closed position, the cabin vertical speed spiked downward to a 2,000 fpm descent rate and the display turned amber. Also, the safety valve indication became amber and the safety valve opened. I then moved the outflow valve back towards its original position near the first tick mark and the safety valve closed. At this point, I selected the auto mode again which brought CPC SYS2 on line with a green indication. CPC SYS2 did not appear to react any differently than CPC SYS1 did. The indicated cabin altitude peaked at about 14,500 feet which caused the passenger oxygen masks in the cabin to automatically drop. Upon reaching 10,000 feet we were able to brief the flight attendants on our status as well as make a PA to the passengers. We were then able to continue with a normal approach and landing.		On our arrival, approximately 30 minutes from landing, after an uneventful flight, Center had cleared us to descend from FL300 to FL 240. The pressurization page appeared on the lower center screen soon after that, and the cabin altitude was flashing and green, indicating approximately 8,900 feet, and the cabin rate of climb was indicating a 500-600 fpm ROC, with no associated ECAM's, or fault light on the auto pressurization switch. We donned our O2 masks, established communications, and I began an expedited descent, after accessing that there was no apparent damage to the aircraft indicated, and asked the FO to inform center we had a pressurization problem, and to request a descent to 10,000 feet, which they approved. The cabin pressure continued this climb at a rate of 500-700 fpm. The FO switched the pressurization control to manual to arrest the climbing cabin altitude, and at one point saw the cabin overpressure safety valve symbol flash amber to indicate it opened but then quickly went away when he manually opened the outflow valve in response. This was confusing, since the cabin altitude was indicating a climb. (He then selected sys. 2; no fault lights illuminated, but went back to manual in order to evacuate the odor in the cabin produced from the hot O2 generators. We were never convinced that there was anything actually wrong with the automatic systems, but still had to respond to the indicated cabin altitude climbing uncontrollably). The cabin O2 masks deployed at approximately 14,500 feet cabin altitude with the associated ECAM for excessive cabin altitude. The FO accomplished the ECAM items, and reviewed the QRH for compliance. I called the Lead Flight Attendant, and gave her a brief explanation of what was happening. She indicated no issues in the cabin with the aircraft or passengers, besides the O2 mask deployment. At no time did anyone indicate they were experiencing any ear discomfort normally associated with such a depressurization, and the pressurization system indicated no problem other than the climbing cabin altitude. Neither of us recalls looking to see what the cabin pressure differential was indicating. Upon reaching 10,000 feet, we removed our O2 masks, and I made a PA to the cabin concerning our situation, and that the O2 masks were no longer needed, reassured them that the aircraft was safe, and that we were proceeding as planned, and our ETA. We had made the decision to not declare an emergency, and proceeded to destination for an uneventful VFR approach and landing. The actions of my FO as well as the cabin crew in response to this incident were very commendable. Everyone did an outstanding job.		A320 flight crew experiences an apparent pressurization anomaly after commencing descent and receives clearance for an expedited descent to 10,000 feet. The cabin pressure indication eventually rises to 14,500 feet where the passenger oxygen masks are automatically deployed. Attempts to control the cabin pressure manually are not successful with the safety valve opening at one point, indicating a cabin over pressure.

I was woken by a Flight Attendant who stated that there was smoke in the cockpit, that we were diverting, and that we were landing in about 45 minutes. Upon returning to the flight deck, I could immediately detect an electrical smoke-type smell, but did not see any indications of smoke. The flying pilots were talking to Maintenance and in the process of pulling an overhead circuit breaker. The lower EICAS DISPLAY panel was black (blank). Fuel dumping was in progress. The navigation display showed direct to the divert airport. The Captain and First Officer briefed me that after going black, the lower EICAS DISPLAY had started to smoke around the edges of the glass screen. A smoky wisp at first, but then at a higher level that greatly concerned them. They had contacted Dispatch via SATCOM, and Maintenance was patched in. An emergency had been declared with ATC and squawking 7700. I was briefed that we were diverting and approximately 45 minutes from landing. Also, the crew was in the process of dumping fuel to 56,000 pounds remaining fuel (to attain maximum landing weight of 460.0) The Captain asked me to refer to the Pilot Diversion Guide. (Prior to my entering the flight deck, a Flight Attendant asked that we make an announcement to the passengers that we were diverting, as they were aware of a course change on the inflight entertainment system. This request was passed along to the Captain). Passengers were notified of our inflight condition; divert destination, and arrival time/weather. At some point in the descent, 'FUEL AUTO JETTISON' EICAS Message Condition: One of these occurs: 'The total fuel quantity is less than the fuel to remain and a jettison nozzle valve is open.' 'The fuel jettison automatic shutoff is failed.' The First Officer referred to the ECL. The Fuel Remaining indication on the Upper EICAS DISPLAY went to 0.0. The Captain attempted to override manually to return to the desired level of fuel remaining 56.0 LBS. This was unsuccessful at first, but eventually the fuel remaining returned to 56.0 without further input. Captain requested from Air Traffic Control that Fire/Crash Rescue equipment be in position on arrival at Runway 24, as a precaution. The Captain did not feel the situation necessary for preparation for evacuation, but felt prudent to have equipment available. During descent phase, a second EICAS message 'C1 ELEC HYD PUMP FAULT.' In conjunction with FAULT light in overhead panel 'C1 ELEC HYD PUMP' switch. ECL referred to and switch was secured in OFF position. Status message appeared on Upper EICAS DISPLAY. When referred to Status page, the following messages were noted: (this may not be a complete list). ELMS P110 PANEL + Door Flight Lock 1L/2L/3L/4L + CARGO HEAT AFT. From that point on, the remaining flight was uneventful with vectors to final approach CAT 1 ILS Runway 24. A normal landing and touchdown were made. Announcement made to passengers that everything was OK, and that we would taxi to the ramp area where fire equipment would inspect the exterior of the aircraft, as a precaution. A single fire truck inspected the nose wheel area and reported no visible damage or concern. Gear synoptic was checked for brake temperatures. We taxied to the terminal/loading bridge. Fire Fighting personnel boarded the airplane and entered the flight deck to get a briefing from the Captain. As part of their process, they used a special heat detecting camera to scan the instrument panel. No unusual heat was detected and personnel felt that there was no further concern with the Lower EICAS Display other than residual 'electrical smoke' odor. Landing weight 458.0 LBS. (460.0 Structural). Landed with approximately 53.0 LBS. Upon completion of Parking Checklist, kept ADIRU ON and APU running for SATCOM availability. FUEL JETTISON REPORT was provided via SATCOM to Dispatcher at the gate. Notification of landing weight below Max Landing Weight was passed to Maintenance.Ground support personnel contacted a contract aircraft Maintenance Technician 'Engineer' who was not qualified on B-777. His initial suggestion was that Lower EICAS Display might be deferrable. Further inquiry was made regarding contacting/locating B-777 qualified technician in the local area for further investigation/inspection. The ELMS P110 PANEL Status message was of concern, plus the other status messages. Via SATCOM we spoke with the Duty Manager for Human Factors Checklist. Crew Scheduling determined that our duty day would expire at in about two hours, if we were able to continue to our filed destination, and in about five hours, if we were able to fly to a closer domestic destination. As the hours ticked by, it was determined that maintenance engineers would arrive from our departure airport that evening with a replacement display panel and parts for ELMS P110 Panel. We were assigned a departure time to our filed destination the next morning.	The reporter stated that the lower EICAS display failure and the ELMS malfunctions were not connected. The EICAS issue was resolved when his Company flew a replacement part into the divert airport. The ELMS anomaly was much more complex and not resolved when the crew departed two days later on a substitute aircraft.The ELMS P110 panel has numerous cards and other components on which it stored information following a malfunction. In this case, the reporter stated that Maintenance apparently did not understand the relationship between the P110 cards because the available documentation did not fully describe the consequences of one card's malfunction affecting other cards. The reporter did not know specifically why the ELMS was MEL'ed but assumed that Maintenance had considered the complex ramifications of the MEL. Apparently that was not the case, because the next day during the takeoff roll at the divert airport the EICAS again alerted FUEL AUTO JETTISON which resulted in a rejected takeoff and a return to the gate. Maintenance at that point was at a loss about the EICAS alert and so the flight was cancelled for another day while a replacement aircraft was flown in. The reporter checked on the aircraft several days later and determined that the ELMS had two faulty cards and had been out of service for several days during a maintenance investigation of the event. A second issue which concerned the reporter was related to the iPad stored Flight Manuals. During this event an iPad was referenced for systems information and when activate displayed a 'Provision Fault' alert which would not permit access to the software manuals. The reporter is not certain what the alert meant, but as a result of his experience he would not accept a B777 which did not also have a set of paper manuals on board. The specific issue was some portion of Electronic Checklist (ELC) was powered by the P110 panel, and whatever failed in that panel prevented the ELC from functioning. Since the iPad would not function, that particular device could not display an appropriate checklist and without the paper manual the crew would not have been able to address the checklists needed for the EICAS displayed malfunctions.	Airplane was released by Maintenance with a deferral for 'ELMS P110 CHANNEL INOPERATIVE' but there were no associated flight crew procedures or notes. All systems operated normally until shortly before entering Oceanic airspace. I then noticed that the lower EICAS screen had gone black. The First Officer then informed me that thin smoke was coming from the edges of the failed display (oxygen masks not needed). I immediately informed Control that I was declaring an emergency and wished to proceed to a divert station. A left turn direct was authorized and we proceeded to divert. The First Officer initiated contact with Dispatch and Maintenance. Maintenance advised which circuit breaker controlled power to the failed screen. We opened that CB and the smoke began to subside. Shortly after fuel jettison began we were presented with an EICAS message and ECL Checklist prompt for 'Fuel Auto Jettison' and also observed that the 'Fuel to Remain' display, which had been 56.0 now indicated zero. Use of the manual adjustment knob failed to change the zero value and the fuel system synoptic showed a yellow 'X' fault for the left jettison valve. I discontinued jettison long enough to analyze the problem and then decided to resume jettison while monitoring total fuel values. At some later time jettison system faults cleared and fuel jettison was completed normally. EICAS also displayed a checklist prompt for the Center Hydraulic System C1 Electric Pump which we then turned off per checklist procedure. EICAS also displayed a notice that 'Cargo Heat Aft' had failed. Status Messages were displayed for 'Door Flight Lock' 4L, 3L, 2L, 1L and by the time we got to the gate 'P110 Panel' (possibly in flight as well). Purser was briefed that preparation for evacuation was not needed and Relief Officer, who had been on scheduled rest break, returned to the cockpit to assist the First Officer with all aspects of airplane fault management and preparation for landing. I requested Emergency ARFF to meet the flight and after clearing the runway they performed a safety inspection of the nose area of the plane. Following their 'all clear' I taxied to the gate.		A B777 lower EICAS display began smoking at cruise on an international flight so an emergency was declared and while diverting EICAS Messages for Fuel JETTISON, FUEL REMAINING, a HYDRAULIC Pump, Cargo Heat and Door Lock were displayed. The flight terminated uneventfully for delayed maintenance.

We verified and executed the clearance, then selected Managed Descent.At this point we transitioned FL180 and I called for the descent Approach Checklist. Upon reaching MNSTR I noticed that we were at 13,000 although the procedure required crossing between 16,000 FT and 15,000 FT and at 250 KIAS. I advised the Captain, verified the situation, ensured we were in Managed Descent and complied with all remaining restrictions.I'm not sure what happened! I just do not know how much more I can do. ATC is always issuing new clearances and restrictions which create a lot of confusion when running checklists and managing the vertical path and ensuring compliance with restrictions. We get way too many clearance modifications from ATC on all of the arrivals, all of the time and on a regular basis.				An A320 flight crew, as well as the Managed Descent mode of the FMGC, were flummoxed by multiple ATC directed modifications to the GEELA RNAV STAR and descended to cross MNSTR at 13,000 vice between 16,000 and 15,000 as required. The reporter expressed his dismay for the complexity of the STAR procedure, the inability of his autoflight system to comply with that complexity and especially for modifications to it given by ATC which may render the flight crew unable to comply due to excessive workload.

The First Officer asked if he should answer the phone and I said not at this time. At few seconds later ATC cleared us to 14,000 FT. We acknowledged and kept climbing. Before reaching 10,000 FT we then answered the call. The First Officer spoke to Lead Flight Attendant and she reported a strong acrid odor in the cabin. We then asked ATC for a level off to work a problem for a few minutes and then we selected Command A autopilot. Neither the First Officer nor I noticed any odor. I then handed the aircraft to First Officer and spoke with the Lead. I then arranged to have the Flight Attendant enter the flight deck while I investigated the cause. As soon as I opened the cockpit door I noticed how strong the odor was and immediately informed the Lead that we were returning to the departure airport and [to] prepare the cabin for an airport return and that we would be back on the ground in 10 minutes. Upon closing the cockpit door I resumed my duties at pilot flying and informed the First Officer that we will be returning. We contacted ATC and requested to return. After a very brief discussion we declared an emergency and requested Runway 9 for landing. Not sure why the event happened but in my post flight de-brief with the flight attendants I was informed that the aft Flight Attendant smelled a strong odor about 10-20 seconds after takeoff and the odor had worked its way up to the forward flight attendants about a minute after that. Also in my debrief the Lead Flight Attendant said that next time she would use 6 chimes to get my attention. Also in my debrief with the First Officer and flight attendants, and I am embarrassed to say I neglected to use TEST procedure. In the debrief the flight attendants hadn't noticed that I didn't use the TEST procedure until I brought it up. They assumed correctly the situation. I also made a PA to the passengers that we would be returning back to the airport as a precaution and we would be on the ground and at the gate in 10 minutes. However I strongly believe that active communication was the key and TEST should always be performed. My major concern was to get the aircraft back on the ground. Several times was distracted bet ATC and I had to remind ATC that we an emergency aircraft and required immediate landing. Originally they gave us Runway 10 and then requested and received Runway 9. The odor never entered the cockpit and after landing I learned that the odor had dissipated before landing.		[Narrative 2 contains no additional information.]		A B737-700 aft cabin initially filled with a strong acrid odor which eventually was detected through out the cabin so the Captain declared an emergency and returned to the departure airport.

I was flying the aircraft on autopilot in the select speed and V/S modes. As I approached HIMOM I pushed the 'PUSH TO LEVEL OFF' button and then dialed my speed down to 210 KTS. As I immediately went from the V/S knob to the speed knob, I failed to check the PFD to ensure that I had entered 'V/S zero' mode. My speed was not slowing as I thought it should so I employed the speedbrakes, further focusing on making my speed restriction. At this point the First Officer, who had been heads down inserting a runway assignment change, caught the deviation in my altitude and brought it to my attention. Before I could take corrective action Approach Control (who I learned later had noticed the deviation at this time) issued me a lower altitude. I continued to landing with no further incident.I have had a personal problem with these new RNAV approach procedures from the beginning. With the Airbus' frequent +/- 20 KIAS and 200 FT airspeed and altitude tolerances, I have yet to fly one of these arrivals fully managed where I have not had to intercede (or should have) to make an acceptable crossing restriction. Even during the portions of the arrival that were flown fully managed, it was like riding a roller coaster as the airplane pitched up and down to meet the seemingly arbitrary altitudes it had chosen to cross each waypoint. The engines spool up and down between 0% and 60% and that is just to stay within the [system's wide open] 40 KTS window. It makes for a very poor ride for the passengers and should be an affront to any professional pilot. On previous arrivals I had tried using 'selected speed' to stabilize the engines while allowing the autopilot to descend in the managed mode. The pitching was even worse as now I'd taken away its 40 KTS window. This leg I tried for the first time to fly the arrival with V/S and Selected Speed selected. The descent was very pleasant and only required occasional tweaking of the V/S to stay on profile. The engines stayed steady to hold speed. If I had managed to actually activate the push-to-level-off function at HIMOM the arrival would have been perfect and would be my preferred way of doing the arrivals from now on. Since I didn't, all I really managed to do was substitute the imperfections of the autopilot with my own. I have only flown a few of these arrivals where Approach Control has not vectored me off for 'spacing'. I have never flown one where the throttles go to idle at the top of descent only to spool up at the final approach fix, as we were told would be the case during training. Before [the implementation of OPD RNAV STARS], I only had to sweat making one crossing restriction at either TOMSN or DANDD. Now I have to sweat a dozen on each arrival into DEN. And I can now blow the restriction in either selected or managed mode! That's called progress I suppose. I suggest that we give the guy who thought of these arrivals a pat on the back, a promotion with a big fat bonus check and a corner office as far away as possible from anything important that may be going on in aviation. Then [trash] can these arrivals and let's get back to flying airplanes instead of generating deviation reports. I want to add the First Officer was doing his job and there was nothing procedurally he could have done to prevent this, given the duties he was performing at the time. This incident was entirely my fault.		The Captain was flying the aircraft on autopilot using 'vertical speed mode' as we were 'descending via' the MOLTN1 RNAV arrival into Denver. The use of 'Managed Descent' mode of the autopilot could have prevented the deviation. Better monitoring of the approach during periods of high workload/task saturation on my part should have caught the error in time to level off.		The Captain of an A320, 'descending via' the MOLTN RNAV STAR to DEN, utilizing Vertical Speed and Selected Speed modes vice Managed Descent, failed to comply with the 'intermediate' crossing restriction at HIMOM when he failed to ensure the jet was leveling at the prescribed 11,000 MSL. The First Officer alerted the deviation at 10,700 and ATC issued a timely further descent.

We continued the departure profile and at 10,000 feet I began the QRH procedures to correct an IRS fault. We complied with the checklist and ended it at the point where the fault light extinguishes. My attitude indicator was slowly returning. At this point we had elected to return to the departure airport due to the failure, loss of the autopilot, and the weather enroute. As I was checking the overweight landing procedures in Part 1 and the QRH, the fault came back on with the loss of more instruments on my PFD. We were already running the checklists for our return and did not return to the IRS Fault Checklist. At one point I noticed our airspeed had exceeded 250 [knots] below 10,000 feet which we promptly corrected. On final approach I declared an emergency due to the overweight landing. The landing was smooth and uneventful.I believe we handled this in a good manner as did the FAA inspector who was giving us a check ride. The only issue perhaps is that the checklist had two choices the light extinguishes or the light remains illuminated, our light did extinguish for awhile, long enough for me to move on to  and complete other checklists. When it came back on it seemed I lost more instruments on my PFD and my ND. It was day VFR and the airport was in front of us so we just continued and landed.				A B737-800 IRS failed during takeoff and because it would not properly reset the aircraft was returned to the departure airport for an overweight landing.

It's not an airplane issue; it is a physics issue with the crappy TSHNR1 RNAV STAR.		Prior to descent we discussed and verified proper altitudes and speeds programmed in the FMGC.  In the descent, however, the green donut several times showed us high when in reality we were low on the profile. We tried to 'recruise' to fix the issue but were still not confident in the information calculated by FMGC. Due to the confusion we did get high and I mentioned to First Officer he needed to take action.		An A320 flight crew was unable to comply with the crossing restriction at WOOKY on the TSHNR RNAV STAR to DEN.

We were taken off the approach 3 or 4 times for traffic spacing. Additionally, there were several speed changes during the arrival. Our last clearance vectored us on a North heading and to descend to FL 190. Then we were cleared direct to GEELA and to join the arrival we began our descent to cross GEELA below 16,000 feet. I noted that The First Officer set the altitude to 7,000 feet on the MCP and the FMA indicated we were in managed descent. Passing 18,000 feet we began our descent checks, made the arrival PA and read the Descent Approach checklist. MNSTR is the arrival fix after GEELA and requires an altitude between 15,000 feet and 16,000 feet. I looked up and saw we were passing below that crossing altitude. The First Officer noticed it at the same time and made corrective action.I am not sure why the computer failed to capture the crossing altitude except that perhaps since these crossings were so close together and being so high on profile due to ATC spacing.I have noticed this trend and while it's not the prescribed way to descend on a managed descent I feel that selecting the lowest altitude for the arrival is part of the problem during these kinds of situations. I think it would be better to set the lowest crossing altitude for the next fix in the MCP when high workloads are expected in this case if 16,000 feet was set the MNSTR crossing would have been honored. Additionally, continued resetting of the MCP ALT window will keep the crew in the loop even in periods of low workloads on these arrivals.				An A320 crew failed to arrest their descent as required while utilizing Managed Descent to vertically navigate the GEELA RNAV SID to PHX. The reporter suggested setting each waypoint's lowest crossing restraint to ensure compliance rather than their current SOP of setting the ultimate lowest altitude and depending on Managed Descent to comply with intervening altitude and speed constraints.

Captain typed 270 KTS in PERF page (DES) of MCDU. We crossed HERNG at FL320 and 270 KTS in managed descent. The aircraft started a slow descent after HERNG and barely made KOHOE at FL280 (270 KTS). To compound the situation (and we believe this to be the determining factor to the issue), ATC slowed us to 230 KTS. The aircraft performance was unable to lose 6,000 FT between KOHOE and SAYGE (only 15 DME) with max drag (spoilers) and a change in automation to OPEN DES (because managed descent had us leveled off trying to slow to 230 KTS). We advised ATC unable to cross SAYGE below FL220; then advised unable to cross MOKME below 17,000 FT. ATC then gave clearance to maintain 250 KTS and descend to 14,000 FT.We believe trying to slow the aircraft started a chain of events that would not allow the aircraft performance to cross at or below the crossing restrictions. The Captain was using good CRM the entire time and was aware immediately that we would not be able to cross SAYGE below FL220 and MOKME below 17,000 FT. With the experience, I would notify ATC (on future flights) that we could either give them the speed or altitudes, but not both.		Three things. ATC should not expect to give additional speed constraints without possible difficulties in flying profile descents. The software on this approach needs to be re-evaluated for possible errors. Finally, ATC should acknowledge that the deviation in altitude was not a concern. ...we checked and crosschecked each point on this arrival and flew the arrival as trained. We did not change any constraints and if not for intervening and notifying ATC we would have zipped right through one of the programmed constraints built into this arrival. I suggest taking a close look at the programming of this arrival.	The reporter verified what was implied in his reassurance about flying the arrival '...as trained' and the fact they '...did not change any constraints.' He advised SOP at his carrier does not allow flight crews to physically alter constraints in the FMC/Autoflight system. He agreed, however, that alterations to those constraints required by ATC can quickly become a quagmire requiring much flight path button pushing in attempts to satisfy both the FMS and ATC and will, at times, result in an inability to comply with constraints as happened in this case.He also restressed his belief that stated relief from responsibility for any deviations that result from ATC intervention should accompany any such clearance.	When cleared to 'descend via' the KOHOE RNAV STAR to DEN 'except maintain 270 KTS' the flight crew of an A320 was unable to comply with subsequent altitude crossing restrictions at SAYGE. The reporters cited the initial 270 KTS and subsequent 230 KTS ATC restrictions as primary contributing factors.

We complied with the ECAM and referred to the FM and completed the additional steps. We did switch the IR to ATT mode and entered our heading per the FM but the IR seemed to remain completely inoperative. The MRM code for the malfunction was entered into ACARS. Approximately 55 miles out during descent IR Number 3 faulted. This resulted in the loss of the A/T along with both autopilots and flight directors and the First Officer's flight displays and put us into alternate law. I became the PF and the First Officer completed the ECAM and referred to the FM. The ECAM kept repeating and was difficult to clear and step through. By this time we were with Approach Control and cleared direct to a fix on the ILS to intercept. Approach control advised us LLWAS was in effect with winds out the N-NW at 10-15 KTS and that there had been recent reports of W/S. We were less than 30 NM out and there were still more of the checklist to read through and also the Approach/Landing Corrections for Failures procedure to complete. Considering these factors and since I was hand flying on raw data and the First Officer was very busy we decided it was prudent to declare an emergency and request delay vectors. The First Officer completed the checklists, the landing procedure and landing distance calculations, and notified Dispatch. The flight attendants and the passengers were briefed. I did not ask for cabin prep or request ARFF equipment. We completed an extended 270 degree right turn and landed uneventfully on the slightly longer runway. The airplane was in direct law for landing and flaps 3 per the FM. The wind was reported I think 350/11 with no recent W/S. The ARFF trucks were out and followed us to the gate. We briefed Maintenance and the outbound flight crew. Had we been further out when the second IR failed we may not have declared an emergency. In that case we would have had plenty of time to do everything and this would have been more of a non-event. However this situation presented like it would have made a good traditional simulator training scenario happening so close to arrival. Over the years I have been advised that declaring an emergency helps buy time and reduce workload with the service ATC provides. We did not especially want to hold with raw data or be rushed in for landing. I also thought the risk of a pilot deviation was greater due to no autoflight at all and the workload as it was.		About 2 hours into the flight we lost our No. 2 IR. I was just returning from the bathroom so the Captain had complied with the ECAM. We reviewed the Flight Manual (FM) and sent in the maintenance code. About an hour and a half later, in VFR conditions, while on the arrival descending below 20,000 feet the autopilot kicked off and I, Pilot Flying, (PF), lost most of my Primary Flight Display, (PFD) and Navigation Display, (ND). We had lost the No. 3 IR and got the ECAM Nav IR 2 + 3 Fault. The Captain quickly finished the Approach Descent Checklist and then he became the PF. I went through the ECAM checklist and then to the FM. The checklists were somewhat long and I could not get them done as ATC was vectoring us now for landing. The Captain opted to declare an emergency at this time to give us more time to complete the checklists associated with the loss of IRs 2 + 3. ATC was great giving us vectors around while we completed the checklists and informed dispatch. After calculating the landing distances and going through the F/CTL Direct Law non-normal procedure we reviewed all we had lost and when the aircraft would go from ALTN LAW to Direct Law and Manual trimming of the aircraft. When we were ready we notified ATC and told them we would take the longer runway. We received vectors to final for an uneventful landing flown by the Captain and taxi-in was normal. We did leave the ADIR's on at the end of the shutdown checklist to facilitate Maintenance troubleshooting and talked to Maintenance and the Fire Rescue who came on board to check to make sure everything was alright.		A320 flight crew experiences the loss of two IRU's. The first in cruise and the second an hour and a half later during descent. This results in Alternate Law flight controls and Direct Law when the gear is extended for landing. The time required to accomplish all checklists is long and the crew elects to declare an emergency to accomplish them.

We continued for an uneventful landing on 36.Having never landed Runway 36 before at night, a level of unfamiliarity with the terrain was evident.

It was a reduced climb 1 giving us a climb gradient of 530 FT/NM up to 10,000 feet. The SID called for at least 500 FT/NM to 10,000 feet. Passing 3,000 feet, I called for 250 knots following briefing page guidance. The Captain questioned why I wanted to accelerate and I explained it was due to the guidance on the briefing page. Later I realized he was concerned about meeting the 10,000 feet restriction overhead LAX. ATC gave us an early turn toward LAX. Pointing toward LAX I realized we would have a hard time meeting the restriction. I selected V/S and managed to meet the restriction, but slowed to 210 to 220 knots in the process. Reaching 10,000 feet right at LAX. I selected VNAV to pick up speed again. Right at this point there was a frequency change and the Captain was talking on the radio so I didn't tell him of my VNAV selection. Shortly after picking up speed, I got an 'unable next altitude' and I now realized I would have a hard time meeting the KEGGS at 13,000 feet restriction. Again I selected V/S, but this time we didn't make the restriction and was probably a little above 12,000 feet crossing KEGGS. We did meet the COOPP restriction at 15,000 feet. There was no traffic conflict that we were aware of and ATC didn't say anything about us not meeting the restriction. I think it was a combination of an early turn by ATC and my unfamiliarity with the departure that lead to the event. Had I stayed at 210 and made an easy turn we would probably have made the restriction. ATC should be careful about turning us too early. According to the performance calculations, we should have been able to meet the restriction with a reduced climb 1 with normal acceleration.		Departed LAX in an -800 fully loaded. Shortly after takeoff, the First Officer asked to set speed 250. I told him it would be better for the climb if we stayed at 210 through the turn on the LOOP Departure. He argued that the briefing page note says to accelerate to 250 no matter which direction. ATC issued the left turn to LAX to join the departure. I knew it would be close but he accelerated to 250 in the turn (he ignored what I had recommended).We barely made the 10,000 feet restriction. Got a frequency change and, while I was heads-down changing the radio, he pushed VNAV and of course the aircraft leveled off to accelerate. By the time I caught it, we were too late to make the 13,000 feet restriction by 1,000 feet. I directed him to use Vertical Speed so we could make the 15,000 feet restriction. I explained to the First Officer that there are no speed restrictions on that departure and explained the reason for the note on the briefing page. We definitely had a failure to communicate. There were no aircraft around us on TCAS and ATC carried on as normal as if they didn't even to notice.		B737-800 flight crew reports missing the KEGGS crossing restriction on the Loop 6 departure from LAX due to the First Officer attempting to accelerate without consideration for the restrictions.

ATC cleared us to cross RANJR at FL280 per the arrival. The Captain started descent a little late plus we had a strong tailwind. He elected to use open descent and selected airspeed instead of Managed Descent Mode. I calculated we were going to be high and informed the Captain who said we were going to be OK. He may have trusted the blue bottom of descent arrow on the ND which showed we would make the restriction; however, this indication is totally inaccurate in open descent mode. He then extended speed brakes but we were still going to be high. I informed ATC that we were not able to make the restriction. ATC said it was OK but to cross the next one at or below FL180 as charted. We were also high for that one and again informed ATC in advance. He again said it was OK and to delete the next three speed restrictions and descend via the arrival. We barely made the 18,000 FT restriction by using a lot of speed brake. The bottom of the arrival was at 6,000 FT and the Captain set it and we both verified. The last two waypoints on the arrival are RLLLL, to be crossed at 210 KTS/6,000 FT and LACKE also at 6,000 FT. The Captain was using selected speed in the descent and I saw him make the reduction to 210 KTS. I was looking out for traffic but quickly looked at the ND when crossing RLLLL. I noticed we were crossing it at 8,000 FT (the crossing altitude for the previous waypoint, LETZ) and told the Captain. At the same time ATC asked why we were still at 8,000 FT. I told them we simply missed it. The Captain the started the descent to 6,000 FT but ATC told us to descend to 4,000 FT then gave us vectors for the Mt Vernon visual to Runway 1. Everything was normal after that.I don't know why the Captain changed the altitude to 8,000 FT. Maybe it was to manually make the speed reduction (the way this arrival is coded, the activation and confirmation automatically takes place before RLLLL so the PF has to manually set the 210 KTS.) I did not see him set 8,000 FT nor did he verbalize it or ask for verification. I became partially distracted looking outside for traffic and did not notice the change until it was too late.I think the arrival would have gone well if it had been flown in Managed Mode instead of selected speeds. The Captain did not communicate an intermediate level off at 8,000 FT. The coding issue with activation and confirmation automatically taking place before a charted speed restriction is an unnecessary distraction that may have contributed to the event.				An A320 First Officer reported that their flight was unable to comply with multiple crossing constraints on the TRUPS RNAV STAR to DCA. The reporter cited tardy initiation of the descent, a strong tail wind and the Captain's decision to not use the Managed Descent VNAV mode as contributing factors.

We checked the flight plan against the legs page and found two fixes missing in the departure. DAISY and BENET prior to SXC on the OFFSH departure. We reloaded the correct fixes and proceeded on the route as filed.I figured out how this happened. I loaded the FMS with the [canned route] and it loaded 1R for departure. When I went to the departures and arrivals page and selected the correct Runway 1L for our flight I then reselected the OFFSH6 and saw below the transition SXC with an ACT beside it. I then was thinking OK it's already there, but apparently to get the transition complete you must reselect it again and have it show SEL beside it or it drops when you execute it with just an ACT beside it. Nice got'cha; it got me. Not again though. Please put out a Flight Operations bulletin. Please let others know about this got'cha. We and ATC corrected it before there was any significant course deviation, but we felt others needed to know before some one else was led farther astray and gets into trouble.		We should have compared the fixes in the box to the published fixes on the ground. Time constraints and task load were big factors at the gate. We made a runway change to the box, re-entered the departure and noticed the departure transition said 'active.' I am certain the transition did not actually load, and my failure to verify the fixes ultimately caused the deviation.		A B737-700 flight crew suffered a track deviation on the OFFSHORE SID, SXC transition when they unnecessarily reinstalled the SID but not the transition after changing their departure Runway 1L.

Tower asked if we were ready to depart. I answered that we were ready for departure. LAX Tower cleared us to RNAV to CASTA cleared to takeoff Runway 24L. I informed the Controller that we had the GORMAN FOUR Departure loaded. He said that since we already had that departure programmed to go ahead and depart on the GORMAN FOUR Departure fly Heading 250 cleared for takeoff. We completed the Before Takeoff checklist and conducted a normal takeoff from Runway 24L. The Captain checked in with SoCal Departure who cleared us to climb and maintain 9,000 FT and turn right heading 030 to join the departure. We complied with the instructions and set up an intercept for the GMN 142 radial inbound to GMN. As we began intercepting the GMN 142 Radial SoCal asked us if we were joining the CASTA Two departure. The Captain informed him that we had been cleared for the GORMAN FOUR Departure.SoCal then cleared us to turn right heading 360 and that he showed us as filed for the CASTA Two Departure and that we had strayed into another approach sector's airspace. Apparently, the change in departure procedure by the Tower Controller had not been conveyed to the subsequent controllers. He then had us change to a new departure frequency. We checked in with the new Controller on a heading of 360 and level at 9,000 FT. The new Controller cleared us direct to GMN and climb to 15,000 FT. We were then given clearance to climb to FL340 and [to proceed direct] AVE direct OAK. No traffic conflicts or restricted airspace penetration occurred. There were no further incidents during the flight. After the initial confusion and we were climbing to FL340 between AVE and OAK the Captain took a look at our PDC and discovered I had missed the change on the PDC to amend the departure to the CASTA Two. On my initial contact with Clearance delivery there was no mention of the departure change so my error went unnoticed.		I was trying to figure out what had just happened, [and] then I checked the PDC and realized that we had received a revised clearance and that Tower [apparently] had not advised ATC that we were back on the original [filed] clearance. No further incident. Always check the PDC.		An A330 First Officer failed to note the revised PDC clearance from the filed GORMAN SID to the CASTA for their departure from LAX. When the error was noted as they were about to be cleared for takeoff the Tower cleared them to fly the GORMAN as already programmed on the FMS to avoid delay. The Controller apparently failed to advise the TRACON and confusion and an airspace deviation took place before the error could be resolved.

We had been in cruise flight for approximately one hour at FL370, at night and IMC with intermittent to continuous light turbulence, OAT approximately -54 when the Captain's airspeed indication began to decrease followed by multiple failure warnings including: Captain's 'A/S DISAGREE;' Captain's 'ALT DISAGREE;' Thrust levers increased; Master Caution: and the six pack annunciated 'ENG.' Both EEC's annunciated 'ALTN' and VNAV disengaged. The thrust levers moved to firewall and the upper center DU annunciated 'A/T LIMIT.' We completed immediate action items and determined we had unreliable Captain's airspeed and altimeter indications. We then completed the appropriate QRH checklists. We were now unable RVSM, so advised ATC, and were cleared to descend to FL270. As we descended through FL290, all the Captain's instruments returned to normal and remained normal for the duration of the flight. All probe heat indicators remained normal. A Maintenance review the next day indicated they had replaced the Captain's pitot probe, TAT, and the left ADIRU.				A B737-800 flight crew was confronted with numerous Captain's pitot/static system anomalies and warnings at FL370. During the subsequent descent to exit RVSM all systems returned to normal.

All crossing restrictions were programmed in the MCDU and verified. Captain had planned for a high speed descent as there was no speed restrictions assigned. During descent, ATC adjusted our clearance to include '270 KTS at BRAND.' Speed brakes were extended to help meet this assignment and aircraft was in managed speed and managed descent. The aircraft was programmed to cross DAVYS at or above 13,000 FT and the MCDU indicated that this restriction would be met. At approximately 13,300 FT I noticed that with the current descent rate, it did not appear that the level off would occur by 13,000 FT at DAVYS. The vertical speed level-off button was pushed and even then, the descent rate was such that the aircraft was going to descend below 13,000 FT 2-3 miles prior to DAVYS. Just below 13,000 FT, the Captain disengaged the autopilot and leveled off around 12,200 FT followed by a return to 13,000 FT and then the KORRY 3 arrival without further complications. There was no alert or indication by ATC that a crossing restriction had not been met. It appears that on the A320 aircraft specifically, using speed brakes at higher speeds on descent will induce descent rates that will not be able to be overcome to meet some crossing restrictions while using the autopilot. In this circumstance, the A319 aircraft probably would not have had a problem, and this event serves to remind that the A320 aircraft are slower to respond while on autopilot to changes in pitch. In any regard, when ATC changes an airspeed clearance on an arrival, in the descent, to something less manageable, it may be prudent to say 'unable' next time.				During a high speed descent on the LGA KORRY 3 arrival, ATC issued a 270 KTS BRAND constraint which caused an A320 to go below the DAVYS 13,000 FT constraint by 750 FT.

Airplane was at 170 KIAS and at flaps 3 with autopilot on. The vector put us on a heading to intercept final at 90 degree angle to final 28L and inside the FAF PITTZ which has a glide slope intercept altitude of 3,000 FT. The glide slope for 28L indicated we were high so I asked for gear down, managed speed, flaps full and final check as I recall. Then we set 2,000 FT in the altitude window and I selected open descent to start down and attempt to get on vertical profile while still correcting simultaneously to a 60 degree angle to final.We intercepted the glide slope and within 5-6 seconds of starting down we got a 'caution terrain,terrain' warning and immediately went to TOGA and disconnected autopilot and corrected situation and climbed back up to 3,000 MSL. We were 5 miles approximately north of the airport and I estimate we were at 2,500 FT MSL when we got the warning. We were not aligned with Runway 28L when intercepting glide slope but well north of the runway so we had no vertical protection. I then hand flew the airplane towards 28L but we were too high to make a safe landing so we proceeded to line up up with 28L and executed a normal go around and received vectors from ATC to return for a ILS 28L and made a uneventful approach and landing.		In my estimation, we were approximately 2,500 FT MSL (1,500 AGL) when the GPWS was triggered, on a vector of about 210 to pick up Runway 28L for the visual. It appeared we were taken inside the FAF (approximately 2-3 miles) during this vector, and with the field in sight we were cleared for the visual approach. It could have been a Tower or the ridge on the south side of the river that triggered the caution terrain. The weather was VMC so we could see the ground, although we appeared to be high on approach by virtue of our tight vectoring, wich put us on an aggressive intercept to 28L northeast of the field.		A320 Captain flying visual approach to PIT got a GPWS terrain warning, and after adjusting altitude was too high to continue approach.

We expected and briefed the arrival for Runway 25L. We then received a clearance to fly direct to SQUEZ and descend via the KOOLY4 for landing Runway 25L. We set the MCP [altitude alert] to 4,000 FT for a managed descent. In the descent I realized that it was time for a new ATIS so I requested one through ACARS. Upon passing FL180 we set the altimeters to the just received ATIS altimeter setting (30.37). I am not certain of the exact sequence of the following events, but we received a clearance to delete the speeds on the arrival and change to Runway 25R. This runway does not have an ILS, so we needed to spend some time determining what approach page matches the identifier in the FMGC, in this case I believe it was RNAV Y 25R. About this time we were crossing SQUEZ and the Controller informed us ATIS was now Tango and the new altimeter setting. We reset our altimeters, and I requested the new ATIS since we had Sierra. After resetting to the new setting (30.03) we realized that this was a large difference. Soon the Captain discovered that I had requested, received, and told him the altimeter for PDX and not PHX. At this point we realized that we had likely crossed SQUEZ low.The rest of the flight was normal. The approach planning and briefing was conducted in a non hurried manner which included review of the NOTAMs and runway performance. The Captain is conscientious and disciplined, and he creates an atmosphere in which I should be able to perform my best. In the future I will read the ATIS line by line to try to avoid making the same mistake.		It is certainly possible the Controller issued the altimeter setting during the descent, but we either misheard or were possibly distracted with a route change shortly before SQUEZ.I will certainly give extra scrutiny to ATIS requests, particularly where airport identifiers could be easily entered as a similar airport, such as PDX and PHX or SNA and SAN.		When the First Officer aboard the A320 inadvertently picked up the ATIS for PDX vice their destination, PHX, the altimeter thus obtained may have caused the flight to cross their active waypoint, SQUEZ below the required 15,000/12,000 FT window before they discovered their error.

I did my update of documents during the flight planning process. I believe I left operations on the way to airplane with at least a 75 percent charge. I had the iPad on top of the Ship Set bag during preflight and used it to reference some FM changes and later did FM and FOM systems reviews during cruise. About 4 hours later while using it, the low battery warning came on and it went dark/dead a short time later. I got out my charging cord and realized in the 777 cockpit there is only a single outlet on the flight deck and that the charging cord is not long enough to be able to use the iPad from either primary flying seat. I then thought what would be the result without the backup Ship Set paper manuals and it didn't appeal to my sense of safety. On a long international flight (12 hours), there must be some way of keeping our iPads powered and available from the primary flying seats before removing the paper manuals. The relief pilots were already in rest with their iPads and it doesn't seem to make sense that we would need to share a remaining powered iPad. It is also impractical to expect that by the time we push that each pilot's iPad is charged at 100 percent. The irony is that the passengers have an outlet at each seat for their laptops, but the flying pilots don't at this point in time.				A B777 pilot's iPad battery drained in flight and while occupying a primary flight crew seat, he was unable to recharge it because only available electrical out was further than his cord would reach.

No problems. Near departure time smelled fuel. Upon investigation we found out there had been a fuel spill and even with the aircraft not being fueled, there was fuel spilling out of the NACA fuel vent under the right wing. I had the aircraft de-boarded and turned off the air conditioning packs. The problem was written up in the logbook and Maintenance eventually fixed the problem. It was explained to me there was a faulty valve that didn't close and that he got it to close and the leak stopped. The fuel leaking prior was residual and there was just fuel under the wing and on the ramp. The fire department sprayed the wing and the spill on the ground, after they mopped up what they could. We boarded got a new release and left. The fuel was 8.51 in left tank 15.7 or so in the center and 8.71 in the right. After takeoff climbing through 10,000 FT I got a call from the Flight Attendant at the rear of the aircraft telling me that we had a spray off the right wing about 5 inches in diameter near the wing and winglet area. It was night and the white wing Nav light lit it up. Upon further discussion, I determined this was not a vortex from humid air as the other wing was not the same. The suspected fuel did not dissipate only became a smaller diameter when we sped up. No checklist in the QRH applied to a suspected wing fuel leak, only an engine fuel leak. We elected to return for landing and declared an emergency. Unfortunately I used the term 'I am declaring an emergency' rather than ICAO 'Mayday Mayday Mayday.' There was some confusion about the nature of our emergency and the request for ARFF to follow the aircraft and assess the leak. We landed and returned to a hardstand area, ARFF followed to hardstand saw no fuel leaking. The fuel was 8.51 in left 12.0 or so in the center and 8.71 in the right. I was concerned about faulty valves in wrong positions, why did the right tank not decrease if it was over full or some fueling issue? Also our nearest alternate was an airport 300+ NM away. There was some confusion about the nature of the emergency due to language, and some confusion to where to park. Some hold points were not on the airport diagram. I believe the ATC was giving us the terminal gate name not the number for the ramp. The flight attendants did a great job; the passengers noticed the spray as well and were happy to be back.		I preflighted the airplane and no discrepancies were found. After the fueler started fueling the Captain and I noticed the smell of fuel vapors while performing our cockpit checks. We we're advised by ground personal that there was a fuel leak. I left the cockpit and went down and observed fuel leaking out the NACA fuel vent and pooling under the wing. The Captain had the passengers removed from the airplane and we turned-off the air conditioning packs. Local Maintenance coordinated with Maintenance Control and performed a maintenance procedure verifying that the fueling valves were closed and we were informed the mechanical problem was fixed and signed off in the aircraft maintenance logbook. We had the fire trucks wash the residual fuel off the right wing and proceeded to depart. Upon climbout the Captain received a call from a Flight Attendant in the cabin advising him that a 5 inch diameter fuel spray was streaming-off our right wing which was illuminated by the white Nav light since it was night time and that the left wing showed no vapor trail. After a brief discussion the Captain and I both decided that it was prudent to declare an emergency and return for landing since we didn't want to be flying with the stated problem. I flew the aircraft while the Captain declared an emergency and consulted the QRH which had no procedure for a wing fuel leak, only and engine fuel leak. The Controller granted us an immediate descent to FL40 and a course direct to the IAF on the ILS approach. However, there was confusion by the Controller on the reason for our emergency and it took several follow-up transmissions by the Captain to convey the nature of our emergency. The emergency descent and landing occurred smoothly and without incident. Upon exiting the runway we were asked to taxi to a point on the ramp that wasn't listed on the chart and attempts on my part to clarify the position were met with frustration by the controller. We asked to have the ARFF escort us to the ramp and continued to try and clarify the taxi instructions and we deduced where we were being directed when we saw a guide man on the cargo ramp with lighted wands. My suggestion and concern was the poor communications between us as a flight crew and the Controller. I think it would've been beneficial had we declared 'Mayday, Mayday, Mayday' instead of just stating that 'we're declaring and emergency.' The weather was good and our piloting of the airplane was performed professionally and precisely but I'm concerned that if we had weather to contend with or an aircraft control issue that the poor communication could have distracted us to the point where safety would be impaired. I'm also concerned that a taxi event could occur on the ground/surface due to the lack of charting information listed on taxi spots and parking spots that the Local ATC controllers are directing us to taxi for parking.		B737-800 flight crew is informed of a fuel leak from the right wing vent during passenger boarding. Maintenance is called and a faulty fueling valve is discovered and closed. After departure fuel is reported venting from the right wing tip by a Flight Attendant and the crew elects to return to the departure airport.

The weather was clear with good visibility and west departures and landings. Climbing out on the SID past FL220 and just after First Officer engage the autopilot, the left engine failed without hesitation. After taking a few seconds to analyze the situation, the First Officer and myself immediately went into action and coordinated our efforts in accomplishing the tasks at hand. I started the engine failure checklist, and proceeded into the abnormal, emergency landing and normal checklists. Meanwhile the First Officer declared the emergency and communicated with ATC, while maintaining control of the aircraft and navigated back to the departure airport. As a precaution, the emergency ground equipment was request. I set up the approach, as previously briefed prior to departure, and proceeded to brief the single engine approach and possible single engine miss approach. The aircraft was under maximum landing weight. Early in the above process, the #1 Flight Attendant was advised of the situation and instructed to prepare for an emergency landing and given the pertinent information. Passengers were also advised and continued to be informed well beyond our landing. The First Officer did a very good job on the approach and configuring the aircraft. At about 500 FT AGL he disconnected the autopilot, followed by a very smooth landing. We exited the runway at which point we stopped and ask the airport emergency crew to do a visual inspection as to the condition of the aircraft before taxing back to the terminal. ATC and all other agencies were very helpful in facilitating what we requested. Our total time from takeoff, to the moment of the event and finally touch down was 37 minutes.If there is a recommendation, I would suggest that during training a little more time should be spent in the mechanics of identifying the correct checklists and in demonstrating the flow process from one checklist to another, in particular emergency situations. Although I was able to find and execute all pertinent checklists, I feel some time and superfluous effort was spent in doing so.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information.]		A B777 engine failed at FL220 after departure so an emergency was declared, the QRH completed and flight returned to the departure airport.

While climbing through 14,000 FT we encountered chop. I advanced the thrust levers to MCT so as to expedite our climb through the chop. When passing through 17,000 FT we got a single chime that drew our attention to the engine gauges. The Number 1 EGT was in the red band. This was accompanied by a fuel flow that was 600 LB/hr higher than the Number 2 fuel flow. I immediately reduced thrust to the climb detent and engaged the autopilot. The EGT stabilized below the red band. The fuel flow remained higher than the other engine. The Captain began coordinating with Dispatch and advising the flight attendants of the situation. I advised ATC of our need to return to [our departure airport]. We landed uneventfully. We came to a complete stop after exiting the runway. We asked the fire trucks to observe the Number 1 Engine for anything out of the ordinary. They stated that nothing seemed abnormal so we proceeded to the gate. During taxi the Number 1 Engine still had higher EGT and fuel flow than Number 2. We deplaned the passengers, spoke to some mechanics, obtained another aircraft, and departed on an uneventful flight.		Further examination of engine parameters after the event showed that Number 1 Engine fuel flow was 6,000 LB/hr and Number 2 engine fuel flow was 5,400 LB/hr, Number 1 Engine EGT was 40 degrees higher than Number 2 Engine EGT and remained 40 degrees higher to include ground taxi.		An A320 encountered turbulence during the climb at 17,000 FT so maximum continuous thrust was set to expedite the climb which caused an EGT overtemp so after reducing thrust the flight returned to the departure airport for a precautionary landing.

Having had this happen [to me] numerous times during my many years on this equipment I was not concerned and knew what to expect when referencing the flight manual. Upon referencing the Flight Manual I was dismayed to see that the first action item was 'Land as soon as possible' followed by the next steps which read 'if pressurized engine to idle' with no further direction. I knew from previous experience that this seemed either poorly written or mis-written. A reverser fault never required a diversion unless there were other qualifiers such as pressurized system or unlocked situation. Contact was made with Maintenance, Dispatch, Duty Manager and the A320 Fleet Technical Manager who all agreed that the procedure was improperly written. They concurred that a diversion was not required and a continuation to destination was appropriate.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information.]		An A320 Engine 2 Reverser Fault ECAM alerted and even though the Flight Manual directed a diversion the crew knew is was not necessary.

By the time we exited the turbulence by using almost full control inputs and by lowering the pitch, we were north of the departure track and suspect we did not meet the noise footprint required. We immediately advised SOCAL Departure of our deviation for wake turbulence. SOCAL then issued an assigned heading to re-intercept the departure corridor. The remainder of the flight was uneventful and completely normal - no injuries or issues.				B737-700 experienced wake vortex encounter on takeoff from SNA behind an A320 that resulted in a roll and course deviation.

For instance, on a recent flight I was asked by Memphis Tower approaching the departure end of Runway 36C if we had the JTEEE1 RNAV loaded into the FMC. Yes, of course, we did as, per our PDC and SOP, all four crew members confirmed we had it loaded and had briefed accordingly. When cleared for takeoff shortly thereafter--for my First Officer's first takeoff as a 777 crew member--we were given a 340 heading on departure. Clearly, this would take us off the JTEEE1 RNAV.JTEEE, but we gladly complied and at 400 feet AGL, we selected and flew the 340 degree heading. When finishing our clean up of the aircraft approaching 2,000 feet MSL, Memphis Departure cleared us direct to JTEEE then the JTEEE 1 departure. Sorry, but KIMEL was our next fix after JTEEE and JTEEE was the final fix on the JTEEE 1 RNAV departure for 36C. I asked 'confirm you want us to go direct to JTEEE then flight plan route as the SID doesn't exist past JTEEE?' He came back with the same response. I again asked did he want 'present position direct to JTEEE, flight plan route?' His response was again the same. At this point we were finishing up the clean up, accelerating to 250 and I asked for a higher speed as we needed 259 knots in order to stay clean without flaps extended. I received no response, so I asked again, do you want us to go to DLONG, GAMBLR, JTEEE in accordance with the JTEEE 1 RNAV departure, but he said something to the effect, 'I've given you the clearance and can't explain it any better.' By this time, I needed to concentrate on my student and make sure we maintained aircraft control so per our current Human Factors training, I chose to direct my student to continue to fly the aircraft, let me handle ATC, and climb to altitude safely where we could talk about it in a less threatening atmosphere. I also stated to Memphis Departure I was preceding direct to JTEEE, flight plan route, as per my decision [and per the previous clearance]. [Rejoining the SID by that time was no longer an option as we were essentially abeam the waypoints prior to JTEEE, DLONG and GMBLR.] I wasn't about to do that with potential traffic departing off of the three parallel runways. ATC could have cleared us to turn right intercept and rejoin the JTEEE 1 RNAV departure, flight plane route; or, to precede present position direct to JTEEE flight plan route and all on board would have understood what he wanted. This is the second time I've submitted an ASAP report in regards to Memphis SIDS. Clearly, there needs to be a major improvement in communication skills. Proper phraseology, pure and simple, would have prevented this situation. I'd also recommend, again, that all of the Memphis SIDS be 'cleaned up' to so that everyone understands exactly what they require and we would gladly do as they request.				A Check Airman conducting initial First Officer line training aboard an B777 was compelled to take unilateral action with respect to his initial departure when ATC first insured they were cleared via the JTEEE RNAV SID prior to takeoff, then gave them a 'non JTEEE compliant' vector heading with their takeoff clearance and then was unable to provide a proper clearance to return to the SID and continue on their flight planned/PDC cleared route after takeoff.  The reporter advised this was only one of many such experiences since the recent implementation of the new RNAV SIDs at MEM.

Having read recent safety reports on TIE's and discussed this at great length during my annual Quality Check, I had carefully studied and reviewed the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall checklist should this ever happen to me in flight. The TIE occurred about 30 miles from the expected handoff [on an overwater flight]. I accomplished the checklist correctly from memory to the point that we had a fully recovered engine, but before I could call for the checklist, the First Officer expressed concern with getting turned around before ATC wanted to hand us off to [Oceanic] Radio. The engine was running fine with no need to consider an engine shutdown (which would have then definitely driven us to the checklist), so I concentrated on advising the Company of our situation, coordinating with ATC, and notifying the cabin crew - planning to then pull the checklist out. After coordinating our course of action with the Company and reversing course with ATC, we were very close to our top of descent back to [departure station]. I briefed the planned approach, and as I called for the descent checklist with the intent to refer to the engine checklist afterwards, I asked the First Officer, 'Is there anything else you can think of, we need to do?' He then mentioned we should pull out the checklist. I didn't take the time to say that was my plan; instead, I asked him to read and call out the checklist and every required item had been correctly accomplished in accordance with the checklist. Though I was totally certain all checklist items were accomplished, and the checklist as planned was later pulled out for review after first 'flying the aircraft' for a return, 'Refer to the checklist' should have been done sooner.		After we got established back toward [departure airport] and we were reviewing the event I realized that we had not run the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall checklist from the QRH. I then asked for the QRH and completed the checklist. Due to my surprise and workload at the time of the event there was a delay in running the QRH checklist. Although the QRH preamble allows completing actions from memory, I would have been more comfortable having the QRH checklist drive the procedure. I will definitely in the future 'pause' and seek a checklist that is appropriate for the event to ensure proper procedures and demonstrate proper 'checklist discipline.'		B737-800 flight crew reported engine surge that drove a decision to return to departure airport. Workload caused a slight delay in running the checklists.

ATC never mentioned aircraft until event had already occurred. After the event occurred he mentioned clear of traffic climb and maintain FL340. When the RA went off we had captured the altitude we were climbing to and we were leveling off. The command bars on our PFD were the same as the aircraft was doing at the same time. Climb rate too great in proximity to other aircraft. Never was made aware of aircraft even though it was noticed on our screen. After event occurred ATC said 'clear of traffic climb and maintain FL340' we [thought] you never mentioned the traffic anyway. Decreased vertical climb as aircraft was capturing altitude we were climbing to. In close proximity to aircraft may need to decrease climb rate even if you think your rate will not set off the RA/TA mode.		Climbing out of Atlanta airspace south of RESPE waypoint to an altitude of FL320 we noticed an aircraft on our TCAS display. We were not notified by ATC of the traffic. As the aircraft was capturing the altitude and was starting to level off our TCAS called out a RA and adjust vertical speed. Since aircraft was leveling off and the reduced pitch mirrored the command bars no real adjustment was required. As aircraft went by us ATC said you are clear of traffic continue climb. We were never made aware of the traffic by ATC to begin with. We climbed to our new assigned altitude and continued flight to our destination with no further problems. Possible ATC overload, no real chatter on the radio, possibly an oversight on his side or he did not think the climb or distance would cause a problem.		B737-700 flight crew experiences a TCAS RA while leveling off at assigned altitude. The target aircraft was assigned and altitude 1,000 feet above and no action was required by the pilot flying as the autopilot leveled the aircraft 1,000 feet below.

We got a call from the aft galley Flight Attendant station at around 1,500 FT indicating them smelling the (oily) dirty sock smell also. The smell was not decreasing so we donned our O2 masks and established Communications. We asked for a level off at 3,000 FT from ATC and notified them of an odor in the aircraft. We declared an emergency. ATC was very accommodating and gave us a choice of runways. We turned OFF the packs and engine bleeds to eliminate the fumes. When the Captain called back to the flight attendants after making a PA the flight attendants said the smell had dissipated. We returned to Runway 36. Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighters followed us to the gate and confirmed the aircraft was not smoking and did not have detectable fumes. After we arrived at the gate and the mechanics were onboard they informed us an engine wash was performed when it was overnight. As of this report I am not sure if that was the cause of the smell or it is an actual oil seal in the compressor section. A test is scheduled to be performed later in the day to confirm the cause. In order to possibly prevent this in the future, knowledge of the engine wash would have been helpful in our decision making.		I suspect that the odors experienced throughout the aircraft to be residue from the chemicals used in this procedure entering the cabin via the bleed air system. I have no way of knowing if the engine wash procedure was completed properly, if it was, the procedure needs to be reviewed and changed to prevent any further occurrences like we experienced.		A B737-800 returned to land after takeoff because a strong dirty socks odor was detected in throughout the aircraft. Maintenance stated an engine wash was completed the previous night so the odor may be a chemical residue.

I attempted to correct the nose steering with rudder pedal input, but the aircraft began veering hard to the left. I discontinued the takeoff and attempted to correct the aircraft back to the centerline with differential braking and tiller input. Initially, the nose gear was not responding to the tiller and a crew holding short of the runway reported that the nose gear appeared to be turned completely to the left and was smoking as the aircraft skidded on the runway. Suddenly, the nose gear moved rapidly to the right and steering control via the tiller was regained. We advised the Tower of our situation and cleared at the next taxiway. After clearing the runway, I stopped on the parallel taxiway and requested a tow back to the gate. Initially, Operations requested we taxi back to the gate and said they could not send a crew out on the taxiway to tow us back. Although I had apparently regained control of the nose wheel steering, I did not feel comfortable continuing to taxi because I did not know the cause of the failure and could not be sure it would not happen again while taxiing. I reiterated the need for a tow and they finally agreed to send a tug and crew.  I do not know why they did not want to send a tug, but when I tell them I need one, I expect it to be sent. After block-in, a Mechanic met us at the aircraft and told us it appeared the nose wheel steering momentarily went into bypass mode, rendering the steering inoperative.				The pilot of a B737-800 experienced a loss of control during takeoff roll. He observed a differential acceleration of the engines that caused a drift that he could not control with rudder pedal input, differential braking or tiller command. Once the takeoff was rejected, he regained control but was hesitant to taxi since he did not know the cause.

Was descending to 5,000 feet and upon passing 7,000 feet I called for Flaps 1. At approximately 6,500 feet got a F/CTL Slat Locked-Wingtip Brk ECAM. We told ATC that we had an issue to resolve and asked for holding or vectors. They said that they would give us vectors and asked us to maintain 6,000 feet. We complied. We followed all ECAM/QRH standard procedures in preparing the aircraft for landing.The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and I worked on the slat issue, conferring with him as necessary. I declared an emergency with ATC at ZZZ, advised the flight attendants that we had declared the emergency and to prepare the cabin but it would be a normal landing. I spoke to the passengers and advised them that the landing would be normal however they might see some equipment standing by for precautionary purposes, by our request. I also sent off a quick message to Dispatch to inform them of our situation. I never had time to check their response. At this point our fuel was already down to 7,600 pounds in spite of the fact that I had added 1,500 pounds to our fuel load [before departure] because I was unhappy with Dispatch's fuel load which had us landing with 7,300 pounds. We stopped the rest of what we were doing and requested the approach. We made an uneventful ILS to a visual approach in good VFR weather. We taxied to the gate and left the flaps in their landing configuration. My only comments are that I feel that the QRH procedure for this problem should be simplified or made a little more user friendly. There are points that I think could be a little more clearly presented by a simple change in verbiage. Also, the fuel issue here is an excellent example of a continuing problem with regards to insufficient fuel loads, especially on longer transcontinental flights. I was extremely happy that I had added the fuel but actually wish that I had added more.				An A320 flight crew complied with all appropriate checklists, declared an emergency, and landed safely after encountering a malfunctioning flap/slat extension system.

Going through FL388 we experienced heavy moderate turbulence and the aircraft would no longer climb and we began an uncontrolled descent. The Captain said to declare an emergency to clear the airspace below us as I told Center we were descending to FL350. At no time were we near stall speed. The Captain disengaged the autopilot and hand flew it to FL350. ATC never asked us to fill in the blanks for the emergency declaration so I believe it never became official. I explained to them what we experienced and they said continue on. We polled the flight attendants and everyone was fine. We continued to destination and landed uneventfully.In hindsight I should have not gone to up to FL400 with the possibility of turbulence in the area. It was just too high for those conditions.				A B737NG flight crew opted to try and climb above turbulence at their cruise altitude of FL380 and were cleared to FL400. Climbing through FL390 they encountered even greater turbulence and the aircraft could climb no higher, in fact entered an uncommanded descent. The crew declared an emergency and descended to FL350 for the uneventful remainder of their scheduled flight.

We had already received moderate turbulence from a preceding heavy 757 going to the south complex. We were asked to maintain visual separation from that aircraft and then were given additional traffic turning onto the ILS 24R in front of us, a 747 jumbo and were told by ATC 'Caution, Wake turbulence' (All this with low visibility requiring ILS approaches.) Additionally, we had a slight quartering headwind than generated just enough crosswind to put the wake turbulence in our path. As the pilot flying I perceived on the TCAS we were gaining didn't have enough separation to prevent another wake turbulence event. Thus, I slowed 20 KTS and began flying one dot high on the ILS glideslope. Cockpit workload was high and the radios were busy and the Captain was unable to advise ATC, who then asked what our speed was and complained that he had to slow following aircraft. Perhaps we could have cut in on the radio and advised ATC of the decision to slow for safer separation. I believe that in this case ATC at LAX paid lip service rather than actual respect of the seriousness of the wake turbulence threat. My perception is that they are far more concerned with running a standard spacing than providing safe separation from wake turbulence. I'm not sure what 'caution wake turbulence' even means if they don't want pilots doing anything about wake turbulence. It also seems inappropriate to ask pilots to maintain visual separation from aircraft on the ILS with two miles of visibility while at the same time issuing cautions for wake turbulence from multiple preceding aircraft with speed assignments that generate closure. Thankfully, we were able to avoid wake turbulence from the 747 that would have been worse than what we had just experienced from the 757 only seconds before. Safe separation behind 747s, not a compact final, should be everyone's objective.		[Narrative 2 contained no additional information.]		B737-700 flight crew, after encountering wake from preceding B757, deviated from assigned speed on arrival to LAX to avoid further wake turbulence.

The Ramp Agent was called back to aircraft and asked to plug in again. After disconnecting, the radios and intercom returned to normal. Taxiout was okay, but once we were cleared for takeoff, as power was applied, the squeal returned making the radios unreadable. We exited the runway. After further troubleshooting we attempted another takeoff, but the squeal returned. After exiting the runway we returned to the gate for Maintenance to investigate. Takeoff power never got set so a rejected takeoff was not an issue. After further troubleshooting aircraft was dispatched under MEL 23-43-XXXX aircraft flown to ZZZ with no further problem. In ZZZ, Maintenance replaced the headset jack assembly. As soon as ramp agent plugged headset in the squeal returned at the same volume as before. The discrepancy was re-entered in to the logbook for further trouble shooting. I was pressured to take the aircraft. It was not until I explained to the maintenance supervisor that I was not happy to take the aircraft until further troubleshooting had been performed did they change the Audio Management Unit in the Electric and Electronic compartment. The aircraft was returned to service with no further problems noted. Total delay [was] 3 hours and 30 minutes.		The aircraft developed a whining noise in the ground interphone at pushback. The problem was thought to be remedied but reoccurred upon spool up on the runway. The aircraft taxied back off of the runway and attempted remedial action and contacted Maintenance personnel. The aircraft again took the runway and the condition reoccurred. The crew then returned to the gate for Maintenance. As the aircraft never reached takeoff power and the brake was never released it was not thought that either would be considered a rejected takeoff. Apparently the Dispatcher on the afternoon rotation who relieved me was contacted and asked why the rejected takeoffs were not reported. He submitted a report at that time regarding the occurrences and e-mailed me to advise me of the situation. I am submitting this as clarification on the matter. I have always regarded takeoff to begin at brake release when the aircraft began to move down the runway under takeoff thrust. As this condition was not met I did not see a requirement for a rejected takeoff report to be submitted and consequently did not submit one for either of the events.		The Captain and Dispatcher describe the radio and intercom issues on an A321 after the pushback crew disconnected the headset. The problem returned when the throttles were advanced for takeoff, so the crew performed a slow speed reject. After troubleshooting, the Flight Deck to Ground Interphone system was deferred as inoperative. However, when the next station replaced the headset jack and the system reactivated, the problem returned. The system operated normally after the Audio Management Unit was replaced.

Autopilot 'B' was in use. During the climb at about 5,200 FT, autopilot went into Altitude Capture. At about 5,500 FT to 5,600 FT, the aircraft pitched up to about 20 degrees. The VVI went from 1,200 to almost 5,000 fpm. The autothrottles did not move and the airspeed dropped from 250 to 210 knots. I disconnected the autopilot and pushed the throttles up in an attempt to regain control of the aircraft. We leveled off at about 6,300 FT. The mode control for pitch was Level Change and speed was 250 knots when it happened. A few things that were also strange during this were that the Captain was trying to delete the reduced climb and some of the keys on his FMC would not work. (Mainly the delete key.) We also had a TCAS failure at the same time. Once the aircraft was level at 6,000 FT, we tried to reengage the autopilot in 'B' mode but were unable. We tried both CMD and CWS. Neither would engage. We engaged autopilot 'A' mode and flew the airplane to destination without further problems. Once there, we called Maintenance and they MEL'd both the 'B' autopilot and the TCAS. Once we arrived in base, we asked for Maintenance to come out and we explained everything that had happened. They had several personal there to troubleshoot the problems. We were both at a loss as to why the autopilot would pitch like this when it went into Altitude Capture.		We had been level at 4,000 feet MSL at 210 KIAS accelerating to 250 KIAS and ATC cleared us to climb to 6,000 feet. The First Officer asked for level change, 250 KIAS and then selected autopilot 'B'. We had received a TCAS failure and I was checking circuit breakers. We were climbing at about 2,000 fpm and got ALT ACQUIRE at about 5,300 to 5,400 feet MSL. It appeared the aircraft started to level off.I retested the TCAS system and the First Officer asked to delete CLB-2 reduced power. At about 5,600 to 5,700 feet, the aircraft pitched to about 20 degrees nose up and the autothrottles didn't move. Very quickly, at about 5,800 feet, the First Officer disengaged the autopilot and recovered the aircraft back to level flight at 6,000 feet. We had gotten as high as 6,300 to 6,400 feet MSL. ATC queried our Mode C as they had lost our altitude reporting; I think because of the TCAS test.We verified our altitude at 6,000 feet and they reported our transponder was back online. We reported the TCAS failure to them. After recovery, the aircraft autopilot would not engage in the 'B' channel, but worked normally in 'A'.		B737-700 flight crew reports a vigorous autopilot pitch up as the aircraft is capturing the assigned altitude of 6,000 FT. The autopilot is quickly disconnected by the FP and the aircraft returned to 6,000 FT. Shortly before and during this event the Captain was testing the TCAS and deleting CLB-2 from the autothrust system.

After two hours in cruise we noticed a slight rolling moment followed by the illumination of the LE FLAPS TRANSIT amber annunciator light. Flaps indicated 1 degree with flap handle in the 1 degree position. This action was uncommanded by either pilot. The airspeed indicated 244 knots and at no time exceeded upper airspeed limit. Aural airspeed warning/overspeed was not heard. We then moved flap handle back to 0 degree position and the flaps again indicated 0 degrees. During approach we extended flaps from 0 to 1 degree and found the flap handle was difficult to move out of the 0 degree detent. It felt as though there was resistance to its movement. Selecting other extension positions was normal with no resistance. After landing and clearing runway, selected flaps up. Again, flap handle was difficult to position in the 0 degree detent/gate. We called Maintenance Control after gate arrival and explained what had happened. They advised there was no reported history of this problem on the aircraft and that there was no required flap inspection since a flap overspeed warning had not been detected. They advised that Maintenance would visually inspect the flap components and would operate/cycle the handle to verify its operation based on the logbook entry and what had happened. We made a logbook entry explaining the uncommanded extension and difficulty in operating the flap handle in and out of the 0 degree gate. We also made reference to the fact that the flaps had extended above FL200. Later, a representative recommended filing this report based because the flaps were extended above FL200. I suspect, based on the binding/resistance felt in operating the flap handle at this position, it had never fully seated in the 0 degree gate and that the flap handle migrated from 0 to 1 degree position over the course of two hours.		After clearing the runway and retracting flaps, I noticed that the flap handle had resistance the last 1/2 inch of travel before entering the 0 degree detent.		A B737NG flight crew was surprised when, while at cruise, the flaps extended to the one degree detent, apparently the result of resistance to fully engage the zero degree gate during retraction.

We looked at cabin pressure and saw that cabin altitude was starting to climb, slowly at first (250-500 FPM) and increasing to near 2,000 FPM. I called Center, declared an emergency and asked for an immediate descent to 10,000 FT. Center acknowledged the emergency and cleared us to a lower altitude. We initiated an emergency descent, followed the ECAM procedure and followed that up with the QRH. When we leveled at 10,000 feet we noticed that the cabin altitude had peaked at about 14,150 feet but had partially re-pressurized to about a 7,000 foot cabin altitude. The Second Officer advised the passengers they could take off the O2 masks and explained what had happened. We could see no evidence of aircraft damage or system problems on ECAM, only that the Number 2 engine HP bleed was open and Number 1 engine HP bleed was closed. We conferred with the Dispatcher and Maintenance Control on the SAT phone and determined, with their concurrence, we would continue to destination as, at that time, we were about 85 NM from landing. ATC gave us priority handling and we landed uneventfully. The flight attendants did an excellent job and got several compliments from the passengers.We made appropriate logbook write-ups--including that not all of the masks in the cabin dropped, even though we had pushed the manual O2 mask pushbutton. We split the duties among the 3 cockpit crew members, and felt we were very well trained to do this procedure.You will have to ask Maintenance what the cause of this incident was. They thought it might have been a ruptured duct or bleed issue. We did check the outflow valves and they were closed. Maintenance had checked the exterior of the aircraft before we opened any doors and found no apparent damage.				An A330 flight crew heard a muffled sound, felt a pressure change and noted the cabin altitude begin to climb rapidly. They declared an emergency, descended to a safe altitude where stable pressurization was regained and continued the short remaining distance to their destination.

Captain was pilot flying. We were set up and briefed for [Runway] 35C. VMC in between cloud decks. Approaching STONZ on BYP5 Arrival into DFW, ATC issued us [Runway] 35R as landing runway. Captain configured iPad, ILS frequency selection and confirmed minimums. I selected ILS 35R from FMC database. I then 'cleaned up' the legs page and advised Captain that [Runway] 35R was in box. He acknowledged. Approaching STONZ, we were alerted 'Discontinuity' by FMS and quickly realized that we had no waypoint after STONZ. Autopilot was flying airplane straight ahead, not making expected turn to DIRKK. We were soon off course. Captain disengaged autopilot and began left turn back to course. I selected DIRKK as next waypoint and adjusted FMS course to match arrival. We returned to course having deviated by approximately 1 mile. I'm aware of the well-known anomaly in the FMS database that causes the entire arrival to be repeated when selecting a different runway at DFW. I immediately 'cleaned up the legs' when the new runway was entered. BUT, because I selected the same waypoint that I was flying to (the second listing of this waypoint - down the list of waypoints on the arrival) and 'put it on top' of my the current waypoint, the FMS made the update look correctly until the Execute button was pressed. Then it simply reverted to the sequence of waypoints that were already in the box (STONZ, then a discontinuity, then back to LIT and the rest of the fixes). This anomaly is well known - I've seen it before, but I missed it, rushing to get set up. I needed to reverify the legs page after the Execute - poor attention to detail. But please, get that anomaly fixed. It's been several years and this problem still exists.	The reporter stated that the problem he is experiencing he believes is a design issue which could be addressed by allowing any common waypoint between runways to remain so that track deviations can be minimized.			A B737-800 FMS reverted to the full DFW BYP RNAV arrival beginning at LIT after ATC changed the landing runway to 35R as the aircraft approached STONZ and the crew attempted to change the landing runway.

I verified and selected flaps 1. LE FLAPS TRANSIT amber light came on. Flap position needles went to halfway between UP and 1 with needles split one needle width. I took over flying the airplane and communicating with ATC. I declared an emergency with ATC. I then directed the First Officer to get the QRH out. As we started to look at the procedure for LE FLAPS TRANSIT the light went out, and green LE FLAPS EXT came on. Flap needles still stuck. Overhead lights indicated all leading edge devices deployed. With split flap needles I performed Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry procedure. Also trailing edge flaps up landing. Performance numbers supported landing on the 12,000 FT long runway. We were diverted due to weather, and landed with 4,800 LBS of fuel. Landing was uneventful. The fire trucks met us mid field and followed us to the pad. We were parked off gate due to other diverts occupying a few gates. Maintenance did an operational check and a byte check on the flaps, and after consulting with Maintenance Control signed the airplane off and we departed without any further events.		I was the pilot flying on the first leg of my third Operating Experience (OE) trip and we were a weather divert on approach with approximately 5,000 LBS of fuel. At 5,000 FT and below 240 KTS I called for flaps 1. The Captain verified the airspeed and positioned the flap lever to flaps 1. I noticed the LE FLAPS TRANSIT amber light on and a split flap indicator. The Captain then took control of the aircraft and communication with ATC while I pulled out the QRH. The Captain declared an emergency with ATC while I opened the QRH for the LE FLAPS TRANSIT procedure. The LE FLAPS TRANSIT light subsequently went out and the LE FLAPS EXT came on. I checked the overhead lights and they indicated the Leading Edge (LE) devices were deployed. The flap needles were still split. I used the QRH for the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry procedure. We then planned on a trailing edge flaps up landing on the 12,000 FT long runway. After the landing the fire trucks followed us to the pad away from the terminal with another weather divert aircraft. Maintenance came out and did an operational check on the aircraft. After the maintenance check and refueling we continued to destination without any additional issues.		B737-800 flight crew experiences a LE FLAPS TRANSIT amber light on and a split flap indicator when flaps 1 is selected during approach. While consulting the QRH the LE FLAPS TRANSIT light extinguishes resulting in approach and landing with LE flaps extended and TE flaps up. Fuel was a consideration as the flight had diverted for weather.

We descended from 5,000 down to 3,000 and were on an approximate heading of 360 when we were instructed by SoCal Approach to turn right to a heading of 130 (or close to it). I commented that it looked like he was going to turn us right into traffic, but it was initially hard to determine if we were closing on the traffic or following him. I was concerned but I thought the Controller knew what he was doing. About the time we rolled out on our heading we received a Traffic Alert following quickly by a Resolution Advisory to climb immediately. I disconnected the autopilot and tried to follow the commands but was distracted by the GA light twin aircraft that flew underneath our right side. It was close enough that I could see the pilot's sunglasses and the color of the aircraft. I believe we climbed approximately 300 FT. I'm not sure how far underneath us the other plane was, but I can say with certainty it was only a few hundred feet. The Captain immediately notified ATC of our situation and helped get us back into a stable flight situation (reconnected the autopilot, verified speed, heading and altitude etc). We resumed the flight, joined the localizer and landed without incident a few moments later.My concern is the VFR area just below the airspace and just north of SNA. After we landed, the Captain spoke with Socal Approach via telephone and was informed that they weren't certain the other aircraft was technically violating VFR airspace....though he may have been 'pushing the upper end of the corridor'. He also stated that they are boxed in by mountains so they have to keep us in tight for all 19R approaches into SNA. I filed this report to make everyone aware of two things: 1. - there is a potential for this to happen again in SNA (Or anywhere) and 2. - See and avoid is still ultimately our responsibility. (Everywhere).				A B737-700 flight crew suffered TCAS TA and RAs while on vectors for landing Runway 19L at SNA.

We then turned back toward the LOC and realized the #2 NAV had the LOC frequency in STBY. The crew opted to break off approach. Crew completed Descent Checklist, re-briefed approach, and flew the ILS 27R. During the next flight, the crew noticed that the #2 NAV would switch from STBY to ACTIVE without depressing the TFR switch. A logbook entry was made noting the discrepancy and a Mechanic was briefed. I am certain we properly briefed the approach prior to flying the procedure. What is not known is if the #2 NAV switched to the STBY frequency or if the crew made a verification error. In the future, I will try to crosscheck the frequency selected while on the base vector.		It is unknown if the localizer frequency was originally selected or remained in STBY the whole time. Double check the frequency. All operations were normal up to that point. There were no extra distractions.		B737-700 flight crew overshoots the LOC course during approach and discovers the #2 NAV has the ILS frequency in the STBY position. A go around is initiated and the second attempt is successful. On a subsequent flight leg it is discovered that the #2 NAV radio could switch from ACTIVE to STBY without depressing the TFR switch.

This was the 6th straight day of work, which had included early morning wake-ups and the first two legs had been cancelled from our trip, however we had already checked in early because the First Officer was a new hire and needed an introductory briefing. Our aircraft had an MEL for an inoperative IDG, which required repetitive maintenance action. It was a short leg, so I flew so the new First Officer would have time to settle in. At first ATC check in, Approach cleared us to cross SABBI at 15,000 on the RAVNN 3 arrival. Shortly after crossing SABBI, we were given a 070 heading with descent to 8,000. After leaving the arrival for a period of time, we were given direct to RAVNN and cross RAVNN at 6,000. Because RAVNN was noted 'for Runway 33, expect radar vectors', it was my assumption that we were simply going direct to a fix with a crossing restriction (all intervening fixes were deleted) and no longer on the STAR. The ATIS stated that Runway 33L visual approaches were in use, and I cleared the additional legs beyond that point from the FMS so it would be easier for the First Officer to clean up the FMS when we were on vectors. Approaching RAVNN, we were given a frequency change and the new Controller cleared us to 5,000. Remembering that Maintenance had not acted to comply with the MEL to check APU oil on each departure, I asked the First Officer to make sure that Operations had notified Contract Maintenance to accomplish the MEL follow-up action. Shortly after crossing RAVNN and now on a 050 heading, the Controller asked why we did not proceed to NAVEY (the fix beyond RAVNN's 'Runway 33 expect radar vectors' notation). I simply replied that we had been expecting radar vectors as noted. The Controller then cleared us direct to the FAF and subsequently for a visual approach.Although the assumption that we would be given radar vectors (as noted on the approach chart) was the primary cause, contributing was my personal fatigue at the end of a 6 day stretch of early mornings, as well as the task loading associated with OE for a highly inexperienced First Officer and the additional task-loading while making sure that our MEL follow-up action was going to be accomplished.				A320 Check Airman conducting IOE, neglected to proceed to the next approach fix on an arrival procedure.

We were turned right, off the GRNPA arrival, to a heading of around 280 and cleared the visual approach to Runway 01R in LAS (behind traffic). The vector took us directly over the top of Henderson airport. When descending through 5,100 the Controller said 'do not descend below the Class B (floor is 5,000 there).'Right after that we got a monitor vertical speed TCAS RA for an aircraft right below us over the Henderson airport. Within five seconds the Controller advised we were below her minimum vectoring altitude and 'correct your altitude immediately' or some words close to that. I may have the order of events wrong. All three events happened within about 20 seconds. We leveled off at 5,050 FT until turning inbound which put us a little high over GALNE the FAF for the RNAV 01R approach. Altitude over GALNE is depicted as 4,000. We were able to make a stabilized approach with flaps full. The fix outside GALNE is KIBSE and its altitude is 5,100 FT. Altitude wise we were right where we needed to be. Crews are not given Minimum Vector Altitude charts. Only the Controller has those. At no time was there any yellow or red showing on my terrain mapping which was on at the smallest possible scale. Nor was there ever a terrain call out from the GPWS. This night visual approach from the southeast is a bad idea when vectored over the Henderson airport; too much chance of an RA. No idea why the Controller felt we were too low for the terrain. I looked the next day on departure to the south and it looks flat to the west of that airport for at least a few miles. It is true that any terrain and obstacles are mostly unlighted but they are primarily southwest of Henderson when on a base leg. The terrain is irregular however.I think we need a charted RNAV visual approach built similar to the one built for Runways 19R/L. It should have suggested altitudes and speeds and configurations for each point (see the RNAV visual for 19R/L). In this way we remain clear of all terrain and do not conflict with their MVA chart. The charted base leg should be south of the Henderson airport traffic area. The aircraft will be on glideslope and on speed and everyone knows what to expect. I will no longer accept visuals approaches at night to those runways until a charted procedure is published. I will only accept the ILS 01L or the RNAV 01R. It is way too stressful to have 2 Controller warnings and a RA on a visual approach. Lets get an RNAV visual built to Runways 01L/R.				An A320 crew on a visual approach to Runway 1R at LAS was instructed not to descend below the floor of the Class B, encountered a TCAS RA for traffic at HND, and then were advised that they were below the minimum vectoring altitude and told to correct their altitude immediately. The reporter suggests night visuals from the southeast over HND are a bad idea.

I received a reasonable amount of rest prior to the event. The problem with this flight was the addition of the new [Commercial Chart] EFB. Of the four crewmembers onboard, only one had used the [Commercial Chart] EFB prior. All of us had reviewed the required training prior to the event, however. Having arrived at the aircraft at a normal amount of time prior to pushback, we found ourselves fairly quickly 'behind' when trying to manipulate the new [Commercial Chart] EFB. Having one crewmember with experience with this EFB helped, but didn't fully overcome our lack of experience or knowledge with the new software. We spent an inordinate amount of time trying to input our flight plan and getting the system 'up and running' before launching. Our problem arose in that having spent as much time as we did trying to get versed in the new system; we fell out of our normal routine with regards to all other pre-flight duties. In the end, our error came from having an incorrect speed set in the mode control panel for departure. Specifically, we are supposed to have our V2 speed set in the window prior to takeoff. While I can't recall what our speed was supposed to be, we had a speed of 147 (a speed which was below our V1 speed) set in the window. I am guessing our V2 speed should have been set to 174, and the numbers were transposed. Unfortunately, not a single one of the four crewmembers on the flight deck noticed this discrepancy prior to takeoff roll. I noted [that] the speed was not correct at approximately 80-90 KTS on takeoff roll, but elected not to call for a reject as I believed it was a safer course of action to continue the takeoff, rather than perform a high speed heavyweight reject for a relatively minor error in the set speed. I suspect all our issues with regards to this error were due to the fact we spent so much time and energy into trying to get comfortable with the [Commercial Chart] EFB we made this error in setting the correct V2 speed.I feel this could have been prevented if we would have received a more comprehensive amount of training prior to flying an aircraft with the [Commercial Chart] EFB onboard. Perhaps some ground school coupled with some time in the simulator would have helped immensely as we would have then been much more comfortable with the system, and would have not had to dedicate as much time as we did to it during our pre-flight duties.				A B777 crew was distracted while learning a new iPad Commercial Chart EFB application as they prepared for departure which caused a V2 speed selection of 147 when it was actually 174.

It is 'Alt Hold' engagement during the takeoff roll. Before I go into this discussion, please allow me to state my background. I hold a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, I am a Senior Officer in the military and I held jobs as Safety Department Head, Senior IUT Evaluator and an equivalent of Assistant Model Manager. Over last few years I observed 4 instances where 'Alt Hold' was engaged during the takeoff run, 3 in foreign airports and 1 domestically. The domestic event, I actually saw it change at about 80 KTS from VNAV to ALT. Before each flight, I brief the crew [on] what [I've] seen and the events that occur during this event. This is my brief: During the pre-departure brief, we as crew verify that we have everything setup properly. This is done prior to push from the gate and includes: vertical and lateral modes, usually in LNAV and VNAV, altitude is set to our clearance altitude, Flight Director's (FD's) are indicating properly, takeoff/go-around with LNAV/VNAV below and verify all other items indicate properly. During the takeoff roll, about 60-80 KTS, the VNAV changes to ALT, ALT HOLD button lights up on Mode Control Panel (MCP) and FD's are providing incorrect guidance. As the aircraft takes off, the FD's still provide incorrect guidance (fly down to takeoff altitude) until passing 300-400 FT. At that time the indication and FD guidance changes to VNAV SPEED giving proper indication. One can fly through the improper indication or turn OFF then ON both flight directors for proper guidance. If autopilot is turned on at 200 FT the aircraft will descend to the takeoff altitude and impact the ground. Worst-case scenario is Mumbai, maximum gross weight, at night, in Monsoon and engine failure at V1. We are instructed to turn autopilot 'ON' at 200 FT. A lot of things are happening at that time and my recommendation is to verify everything and not turning autopilot on until passing 500 FT. Many pilots that I brief stated that they been told that the initial altitude was set to zero in MCP. I can attest that is not the case. In Mumbai, the aircraft is warm and when entering the cockpit the MCP altitude is usually set at missed approach altitude and not zero. Discussing this issue with the FOQA personnel, I had been told that the FOQA was registering zero during the engine starts. I can attest that it is not the case. In my 25-year flying career I have yet to see initial altitude set to zero. It might be set zero at the gate, but after the briefs it is always set to initial clearance altitude. That is not what FOQA data is indicating and not what is passed to the pilot group. What I see are two separate problems. One: During the takeoff run, VNAV on its own, transitions to ALT (Hold) and gives improper guidance. Two: FOQA is recording improper indication from MCP. My recommendation is to brief the pilots that this is happening during the takeoff run with proper settings prior to taking the runway and not to engage the autopilot until 500 FT after verifying that all indications are correct. In addition to the 'Alt' (hold) problem, FOQA data recorder should be investigated why it is recording incorrect data. I see them as two completely separate issues.	The reporter stated that the exact chain of MCP takeoff state transitions is first TOGA/VNAV, at about 60-70 KTS an auto-transition to TOGA/ALT, then at 400 FT an auto-transition to TOGA/VNAV SPD. He believes that somewhere in the intervening software an error occurs because FOQA data indicates the MCP Altitude is set at zero while flight crews are confirming it set at the first departure procedure level off altitude. Most pilots do not monitor the FMA during VMC conditions and so at night in mountainous conditions this could lead to a dangerous descent if the autopilot is engaged at 200 FT, as per his company's training, and the aircraft attempts a descent possibly below field elevation. The Reporter stated that he was told 55 similar events have been reported.			A B777 pilot reported the Mode Control Panel (MCP) made an uncommanded mode change from VNAV to ALT HOLD during the takeoff roll at about 80 KTS.

Shortly after beginning descent with Autothrottles armed speed slowed 20 KTS. Thrust levers manually advanced to 50% N1 to stay on speed while descending on path. 45-50% N1 was required until HAWKZ intersection to stay on speed. Quartering headwind had decreased to 24 KTS at FL240 and below. Vertical rate of descent was 1,900 fpm the entire descent. ATIS stated ILS 34L in use which was loaded in FMC prior to T/D. Between HAWKZ and LIINE we were assigned the ILS 34C with the SONDR transition. ILS 34C with SONDR transition entered into FMC. Immediately Vertical bearing showed we were 1,200 FT high and commanded speed dropped to 250 from 270 KIAS. Approaching FOOTT we requested direct to the mall for the visual approach stating we did not want to continue the arrival. Our request was granted. Our workload was significantly increased dealing with trying to get back on path regain the correct airspeed etc. This arrival is neither fuel efficient nor does it reduce our workload. It increases the workload. The new RNAV arrivals into SEA have multiple waypoints with crossing restrictions and speed constraints. These arrivals create task saturation and lack of situational awareness for both pilots monitoring the path and speed on the arrival. ATC changes to the arrival create further complications as the path and speed are affected. These new RNAV arrivals are a safety risk.				B737-800 Captain experiences difficulties complying with the new HAWKZ2 arrival to SEA.

Engine instruments were checked and rechecked with NO abnormal indications. An emergency was declared and a return to land was coordinated with ATC asking for the equipment to standby. Flight attendants were informed and told to 'secure' the cabin. The passengers were informed, and Ops was informed and asked to call and inform Dispatch.

The seat belt sign was on. The flight was descending to FL340 due to chop at FL350. We had initially started a climb to FL370 but had reversed and started a descent after ATC informed us that the next sector had mod chop at that altitude. In the descent, in smooth air, open descent, Mach .78, managed speed. We heard a thump. Not the loud banging we had in training, just enough to wonder 'what was that'. Our attention went to the engine instruments and everything was normal, then the Purser called to say he had heard a loud bang from the right side of the aircraft. I told him we were aware of the odd noise and I would get back to him. We scanned the engine instruments and saw a momentary flash of amber stall on the upper screen, but it lasted only a second or so. Then the Engine 2 oil filter clog amber annunciation came on. I immediately grabbed the Flight Manual to start looking for the correct procedure. The Purser called us again to say he heard another loud bang. I told the First Officer (pilot not flying) to fly and handle the communications and I would work the problem. We requested a lower altitude from ATC, and ATC asked us if we could stay at FL340, for another minute. We said yes. I continued to try and find the Oil Clog procedure when the pilot flying said the Number 2 Engine had failed; I declared an emergency and requested lower FL250, from the engine out data on the FMC. That was issued by ATC and I began to complete the engine failure ECAM that had just popped up on the screen. I sent Dispatch a message to CALL ME and continued the running and completing the ECAM. Dispatch responded with a frequency, which I put into the VHF #2 and passed along our current condition, and divert information to [nearest suitable airport]. We had continued our descent to 12,000 FT and subsequently got a descent to 6,000 FT navigating with ATC vectors to the airfield. I called the Purser to inform him of the time remaining, destination, weather and landing conditions.Fortunately all the back up systems were working perfectly and the weather was better than CAT 1 minimums, with the runway clear and dry. I decided not to prep as the aircraft was flying well with all systems backed up. It was about 15 minutes before touchdown. We completed all the checklists and continued down to 4,000 FT at 15 NM south of the airfield. Immediately after checklist completion we notified ATC and they gave us a vector to the localizer for the ILS to the field. Approach and landing were normal; we rolled out straight ahead and stopped on the runway to allow the emergency vehicles and crew to checkout our engine. Everything was reported to look normal from the chief of the firefighters so we taxied clear of the runway and to the gate. The flight taxied to the gate and shut down normally. Once at the gate my phone was ringing constantly, even before we were out of the seats. I forgot to place a write-up into the ACARS, partly due to the phone calls from Operations and others who I relayed our flight problems to. I subsequently called [Maintenance] later that night to check if I had indeed forgot to enter it. The technician I talked to said yes but that all the information was inputted from transmitted data and some others I had talked to.		[Narrative 2 had no additional information.]		A320 flight crew reported compressor stall and subsequent failure of #2 engine at FL340. Flight declared an emergency and diverted to nearest suitable airport.

During climbout in a light weight -700 aircraft (only 19 passengers) on a cold morning, we were given a climb to FL230. The autopilot was engaged at approximately 8,000 FT MSL and, because of being light weight and cold outside air temperatures, our climb was greater than 5,000 FPM. After our climb check passing through 10,000 FT, we were given normal speed and direct to a down track fix. I selected LNAV and VNAV on the MCP. I checked that both were engaged and the airspeed was holding at the climb speed of 267 (+/- 4 KTS). Passing through 17,000 FT, we were given a climb to FL410. I set FL410 in the MCP and it was confirmed by the First Officer. At this point, we set the altimeter setting of 29.92, turned off the landing lights, and proceeded to put our departure plates in the book. We were climbing fast and the First Officer looked up and said, 'Watch your speed.' At this time I looked at the airspeed indicator and the airspeed was rapidly slowing below 210 KTS. I clicked off the autopilot and realized that VNAV was no longer working properly. I leveled the aircraft but we did get to a speed of about 180 KTS, which was just inside of the amber minimum maneuver speed bar. At level flight, we did get a one second of aircraft buffet so I lowered the nose slightly, got our speed out of the amber bar, again leveled off for a few seconds, and then selected on V/S a 500 FPM climb. We got back to our climb speed of 267 and continued on the flight to altitude. At first we thought that something was wrong with the VNAV system since I checked that it was engaged and working properly. The rest of the flight was uneventful. On our second flight, we were going to watch the system closely to see if was going to do it again. It did not. After further discussion with my First Officer, we decided that the system must have come out of VNAV and into V/S when we put FL410 in the MCP. Since the climb out at the time of the incident was above 5,000 FPM, as we passed through 17,000 FT and selected FL410, we believe that the system had already captured the FL230 that was set. If it had, then selecting FL410 would have put the aircraft in V/S mode. Because the climb was approximately 5,000 FPM, the aircraft continued that climb rate and the airspeed bled off rapidly. Doing other tasks as we passed FL180 took our attention away from the airspeed and the mode that was selected. Lesson learned is anytime you move or select a switch on the MCP you should check the FMA display to make sure that you are in the mode that you want to be in.				A lightly loaded B737-700 climbing through 17,000 FT at greater than 5,000 FPM had already captured the MCP altitude of FL230 and so when the new altitude of FL410 was set, VNAV had already reverted to V/S which allowed the airspeed go as low as 180 KTS before recovering to cruise speed.

The PDC clearly stated the altitude clearance limit of 10,000 feet MSL. We reviewed the SID and noted it had a limit of FL230 with various lower altitude hold downs. We then agreed to set the first hard altitude of 10,000 feet MSL in the Altitude Alerter window. We were cleared for takeoff, RNAV to DUGME and the BAYLR SID. DUGME had an altitude constraint to cross at 10,000 feet MSL. I was Pilot Flying and I made a normal takeoff. The Captain checked in with Denver Departure and reported climbing out of 7,500 feet for FL230 with the restrictions. He then cleared us to FL230 without restrictions and turned us off the SID with a left turn to 260 degrees in order to climb off track above slower traffic ahead. At around 16,000 feet MSL he re-cleared us direct BAYLR intersection and switched us to another Departure frequency. The new Controller further cleared us to FL260 and then asked us why we were above 10,000 feet. Incredulously, the Captain replied because we were cleared to FL230 on initial contact. The Departure Controller then went on a litany of minutiae explaining that you only get 10,000 feet out of Denver. That was a hard altitude. Period.When we were issued an RNAV departure, we checked the plate for altitude limits and then set the first restriction. This being a brand new RNAV SID, they (ATC) should have noted that our initial check-in was in error. We stated climbing to FL230 with restrictions. They just acknowledged it and took out the restrictions. I do fully admit that our PDC stated maintain 10,000 feet, but I (we) got wrapped up in the RNAV SID clearance limit instead.		]No substantive additional information was included in the secondary narrative.]		A B737-700 flight crew departing westbound from DEN was given a PDC including the BAYLR RNAV SID which includes multiple altitude constraints as well as a clearance to maintain 10,000 feet MSL. After takeoff, confusion as to their cleared altitude resulted.

I asked Tower for a phone number after clearing the runway. Suggestions, I spoke to Tower Supervisor, he informed me of a VFR procedure for helicopters to exit the airspace east between Runway 28 and Runway 27L. He also said it was not unusual for aircraft on approach to receive an RA while on approach while the helicopter exits the airdrome. I find this an unacceptable procedure for aircraft to have to respond to an RA in this phase of flight. More importantly, this helicopter was way too close to my aircraft. I believe we were lucky as I am not confidant this helicopter had visual with my aircraft or it wouldn't be so close with out evasive maneuvers. These procedures deserve review and scrutiny. This is a near-miss incident in my opinion.				Air Carrier landing Runway 28 at ORD described a TCAS RA event with a helicopter, ATC stating the helicopter was departing via a VFR procedure which did at times result in a RA with landing traffic.

I was the pilot flying with autopilot 2 engaged. The Captain instructed me to continue flying and to take the radio while he handled the ECAM. The Captain briefed me on the ECAM and we agreed to contact Dispatch via ARINC patch. A decision to divert to our nearest and most suitable airport was made since the ECAM directs to land ASAP, which I supported after considering weather, mechanical clues (no secondary indications), facilities, terrain and overall passenger and crew safety. We coordinated with Dispatch and ATC about the diversion. The Captain reviewed the diversion guide, briefed the flight attendants and passengers, while I followed ATC instructions to proceed. The Captain elected not to declare an emergency after he considered all factors in front of us aided by the inputs that he received from Maintenance, Dispatch, and our threat and systems analysis. We briefed the visual approach and landed without incident.				An A320 flight crew received a reverser fault indication at FL380, they did not declare an emergency but decided to divert to the nearest suitable airport.

We got cleared for the visual approach and started to maneuver for spacing by slowing with flaps 10 and s-turns. Not long after turning onto final, we got into the wake turbulence. The aircraft banked both left and right as we fought to get out of the turbulence. ATC sent us to Tower. I put in the frequency and believed to have switched to Tower. We maneuvered the aircraft upwind and high just as we started to feel the burble of more turbulence. The sun was low in the sky directly in our line of sight. This made the runway and the preceding aircraft difficult to see. We continued down the flight path fully configured and with the checklist complete. As we got below 1,000 FT, we viewed a green light from the Tower and questioned whether we were cleared to land. I thought we had been but, as we started to feel possible turbulence again, we continued to focus our efforts to landing the aircraft as we were close to the ground. Once we landed, we turned off and contacted Ground. They queried us as to whether we saw the green light and we confirmed that we had seen it. We then taxied to the gate for parking. ATC should have let us know that the heavy was already at approach speed at 15 miles out as he positioned us behind him. ATC vectored us to final too early and put us too close to a heavy aircraft. As a crew, we should have gotten vectored back around instead of continuing on the approach. The distraction of the wake turbulence, low sun, and maneuvering kept our focus from verifying the communication with Tower.		[Narrative contained no additional information.]		B737-700 Captain reported wake vortex encounter that provided enough distraction Tower was not called for landing clearance.

Looked at the First Officer's PFD and saw that my airspeed was increasing and the altitude was indicating a climb.  The First Officer's airspeed and altitude indications were normal and within limits of the standby instruments.  I checked that the probe heat was on and there were no visible icing indications.  SAT had previously been checked at less than -40 degrees Celsius.  The First Officer continued to fly the aircraft and the autopilot was still engaged.  We had a jumpseating Captain [onboard] and I asked him to monitor the descent and act as a third set of eyes for us.  I asked Center for a descent to FL320 and was given clearance to descend.  In the descent in IFR conditions my airspeed indicator started to increase and the overspeed clacker started to sound.  At the same time the autopilot clicked off and the First Officer lost the roll command on his flight director.  He also had the IAS disagree warning on his PFD and the airspeed hook was cycling up and down on his PFD.  At this time I declared an emergency with Center and and explained that we were showing erroneous airspeed and altitude indications.  We descended using the FPV and AOA as our main indications crosschecking with Center for our groundspeed.  The First Officer held 3 degrees nose down on the FPV and between 3 and 4 o'clock on the AOA.  I asked for a descent to VFR conditions and vectors for the nearest airport.  We were given clearance to 11,000 feet and a turn to head direct to ZZZ.  At this point I rang the number 1 [Flight Attendant] and told her that we were having problems with our flight instruments and that I had declared an emergency and we were proceeding to ZZZ for a normal landing in approximately 15 minutes, and that I would talk to the passengers and let her know if any thing changed.  In the descent and passing approximately FL200 the clacker quit sounding and my PFD started to show reasonable indications of airspeed and altitude.  The First Officer regained his FD and and his airspeed hook disappeared.  I had received a message from Dispatch asking if conditions would allow a divert to ZZZ1.  We leveled at 11,000 feet and made the decision to proceed to ZZZ1 based on the facts that we were VFR, our airspeeds and altitudes agreed and appeared normal at this time, and both engines were functioning normally.  I asked and we were given a vector to ZZZ1 for landing on [Runway] XL.  I called the number 1 [Flight Attendant] again to tell her we were now proceeding to ZZZ1 for a normal [landing] and that all indications were normal at this time.  PA was made to passengers informing them of our diversion.  Performing the Landing checklist and pushing the recall it was discovered that the left engine had gone to the alternate mode.  Following the QRH both engines were put into the alternate mode for landing.  A normal 30 flaps landing was made in ZZZ1 with all indications normal.  After landing we had the ARFF make sure the aircraft looked normal to them and we taxied to the gate for a normal shutdown.  The only comment I will make is the simulator training on unreliable airspeed was invaluable.  At no time did we as a crew feel that our aircraft was not in complete control.		Flight instruments provided erroneous information while in IMC.  Suspected icing of pitot static system.  Declared emergency, requested descent to warmer air and VMC conditions.  Monitored groundspeed readout and AOA indications during descent.  Instrument indications returned to normal, proceeded to ZZZ1 for normal landing.		B737-800 Captain experiences a pitot system failure at cruise altitude resulting in unreliable airspeed and altitude indications on his PFD.  An emergency is declared and flight diverts, with pitot system indications returning to normal upon exiting IMC.

We noticed the Number 2 engine was losing power and the EGT was above the red line. We had no indication of fire overheat. I was the Pilot Flying. I disengaged the autopilot and lowered the nose. The First Officer called ATC and told them we lost an engine, we declared an emergency, got a lower altitude and a clearance back to the departure airport. The TCAS showed multiple aircraft in our vicinity. I turned on the lights for maximum visibility. At this point my primary concern was aircraft control and remaining clear of traffic. We set maximum continuous thrust and got the drift down speed from the Cruise page. Once I was sure we were clear of traffic and the aircraft was stabilized in the descent, we agreed we had a severely damaged engine. We accomplished the boxed items for the Engine Fire/Severe Damage/Separation/ Seizure Checklist. I called for the QRH and we completed the checklist. After the engine was secured and the QRH finished, the First Officer briefed the flight attendants, made an announcement to the passengers, sent an ACARS message to Dispatch, and called the Company for a gate. We followed the QRH guidance for a single engine landing and landed uneventfully. The emergency equipment was in position and followed us to the gate. Station personnel met us at the gate and assisted the passengers with the help of the First Officer and the Flight Attendants. I briefed the Mechanic on duty. Then I called Dispatch, who put me in touch with the Dispatch, Maintenance Control, and the Chief Pilot. I noted an engine failure and overweight landing in the aircraft logbook. We were pulled from duty and given adequate rest before returning to work. The Chief Pilot's Office even called me the next afternoon to make sure I was OK.		The Captain got the airplane turned toward the west, began descending, turned on the landing lights for maximum visibility to other aircraft. Once we assured that there were no conflicts with other traffic, we began a more detailed investigation of the damage to the Number 2 engine. There was no fire warning, no fire bell, no overheat light, but there was still vibration from the engine, with N1 rotation. We both agreed that it was severe damage/seizure in-flight and the Captain called for the memory items for the same. We completed the memory items and continued with the QRH items for the same checklist. The Captain continued to fly the aircraft and I coordinated with ATC for landing back at the departure airport. I then called the Flight Attendants and briefed them on the situation. I made an announcement to the passengers and advised them that due to a mechanical reason, we would be returning for an emergency landing. I coordinated with Dispatch on the emergency via ACARS and called the station on the operations frequency about our return and to ask for a gate.		A B737-700 had an engine fail in flight as indicated by vibration, high EGT and decreasing N1, so an emergency was declared, the QRH completed and the flight returned to the departure airport.

He said engine Number 1 and no flames were present at this time. I asked Tower to dispatch the fire trucks and invited a deadheading Captain to join us in the cockpit for his advice and experience. I started the APU. The fire chief inspected our engine and said there was no fire. We consulted the QRH for tailpipe fire. I started engine number two and we taxied to the gate while the fire crew followed us to monitor the condition of the engine.

During climb, passing approximately FL320 to FL330 the number one Bleed Trip Off light illuminated. We followed the QRH and the light extinguished. We continued to climb and approximately three to five minutes later, the number one bleed valve tripped again. We followed the QRH again but this time we couldn't keep the light extinguished. Following the QRH, we turned the left pack off to prevent two pack operation from one bleed source and turning the remaining pack to high flow. At the same time we were leveling off at FL400. We now started to analyze our situation of operating at FL400 with one pack and the ramifications of our malfunctioning aircraft further down line. During that discussion, the right pack tripped off. We both immediately felt the cabin altitude climbing and the F/O immediately donned his oxygen mask. I saw the cabin rate indicator climbing toward 1,000 fpm. I then donned my oxygen mask as well. We started a descent and the F/O declared an emergency. I initially had problems communicating because I didn't realize my boom MIC was blocking my mask MIC. Passing through approximately FL350 to FL360, I attempted to regain the right pack by pressing the reset button. It was successful and we continued our descent at a more comfortable rate. We referenced the QRH for Cabin Abnormal Warning/Abnormal pressurization, Pack Trip Off, and Emergency Descent. The passenger oxygen masks never deployed and I failed to record how high the cabin altitude actually reached. We continued our descent to 10,000 feet as a precaution and made contact with our Dispatcher. She was informed of our situation including malfunctions. We then made the decision to divert. I made a PA informing the customers of an aircraft problem that necessitated a descent to a lower altitude and we would be diverting as a precaution. The rest of the flight, descent, and landing were uneventful. After the PA, I talked with the flight attendants and they all reported they felt the cabin climbing as well. They also reported the passengers were pretty calm during the whole event and many were complimentary over the handling of the situation, which I attribute to the calm professionalism of the inflight crew. All connecting passengers were accommodated to their destinations and the remaining passengers continued with us on another aircraft.		Climbing out between FL320 and FL330 had a left BLD trip off light. Accomplished QRH BLD trip off checklist. Pushed trip reset. Reset the BLD trip off light. Within three minutes, left BLD trip off light. Accomplished QRH BLD reset itself. Within one minute. Left BLD trip off light. Performed QRH for BLD light not extinguishing. Turned off left pack. Leveling at FL400, right pack trip off light. Felt ear drums popping and noticed cabin altitude increasing. Donned oxygen mask and established communication. Captain started to descend at that time so I declared an emergency and told ATC that we were descending. While descending the Captain pushed the trip reset and that reset the left BLD trip off light and the right pack trip off light. The aircraft pressurized like normal. We continued the descent to 10,000 feet and told ATC that PSI was under control. We decided to divert to have the aircraft looked at. I think we started to descend too early and could have waited longer before descending.		B737-700 flight crew experiences a left bleed trip passing FL320 for FL400, which is successfully reset. Bleed trip reoccurs at FL400 and cannot be reset, resulting in the left pack being turned off in compliance with QRH. The right pack then trips and an emergency descent is initiated. During the descent both packs are reset successfully but the crew elects to divert for maintenance.

Upon switching to ZDV (DEN Center), we were cleared onto the LDORA1 arrival. With some low level convective activity ahead on the arrival, we were expecting to ask for some slight deviations for weather. We switched to the next ZDV sector, and we were given a left turn heading 340 degrees for en route spacing. Several minutes later we were cleared to intercept the TELLR1 arrival. Shortly thereafter ZDV tells us: '...cleared to deviate up to 15 degrees either side of course, and descend via the TELLR1 arrival.' By this time we were both heads down for most of the descent reprogramming and verifying all the new route changes, as well as the new constraints. ZDV handed us off to DEN TRACON at FL250, and we were then issued to proceed direct POWDR direct DVV, and to descend and maintain 17,000. We were then cleared to deviate at our discretion for weather avoidance to DVV. Normal radar vectors and altitudes from the mid-teens to landing were then provided by TRACON. Also, we twice experienced airspeed anomalies during the managed descent. The FMGC and charted speeds were not being followed correctly by the airspeed tape. It was commanding 210 KTS instead of the required 250 and 280 KT speeds. We as the pilots had to manually select the correct speeds, and also use full speed brakes to meet required altitudes. This required the jet to be hand flown several times on the RNAV STAR just to be at the correct altitude and airspeed at several fixes. THIS IS NOT WORKING!				An A320 First Officer reported specific and generalized problems with respect to conducting RNAV STAR operations into DEN. His summation states: 'THIS IS NOT WORKING!'

I demonstrated in those reports how the B737 aircraft landing gear geometry, through a lateral landing gear truck, hysteresis caused by heavy anti-skid cycling by individual wheels, causes a somewhat predictable hydroplaning phenomenon. This phenomenon although does not occur on every landing, but does occur at the most inopportune times, as demonstrated by numerous B737 runway excursions. In the last two years, there have been dozens of B737 runway excursions around the world. These excursions of course, always have some sort of extenuating circumstance, as explained in many of the accident reports. There is though almost always one common thread.  The statement by the pilots that the 'brakes were not effective.' The technique that we are taught in the B737 says for us to 'trust' the Anti-Skid System and let it do its work, even with the onset or either perceived or obvious hydroplaning conditions. This, I have demonstrated, is quite the opposite that one should do in certain situations. I made some recommendations in my report for possible techniques to be considered by pilots as well as additional contaminated runway testing, especially on non-grooved surfaces. I would like to emphasize that, I have personally experienced and demonstrated photographically in my report, how, with heavy braking on non-grooved runways, reverted rubber hydroplaning is guaranteed and actually predictable. Thereby causing potential nil braking conditions, down to taxi speeds, when pilots need the stopping ability the most. That is, when the aerodynamic braking abilities through [Engine] Reversers and air drag forces are insignificant at slower indicated airspeeds. I can argue professionally, demonstrably and statistically how, in every runway excursion, with or without either pilot or weather induced variables, my demonstrated hydroplaning findings are at least a contributing factor and many times a causal factor in all B737 runway excursions. The incident in ZZZZ is especially intriguing with evidence to support reverted rubber hydroplaning at slow speeds. First, I recall reading a report that indicated an Investigator saying '...runway looked as if it were steam cleaned by the Main Landing Gear (MLG) tires.' [Pictures I have seen] of the over run surface is clearly perturbed, as can be explained by the above 'steam cleaning' comment caused by Air Carrier X B737-800 Main Gear. The yellow chevrons in the over run are indications of this 'cleaning' effect. The white runway outline stripe has this cleaning effect as well and is easily seen. The most pronounced examples on the runway outline strip are the marks made by the Number 1 and Number 2 tires. The least noticeable, difficult, yet visible indication of reverted rubber hydroplaning 'steam cleaning,' is the 'cleaning' of the fifth from the left runway end makings.  The explanation that the pilots landed too long, too fast on a wet runway, is the obvious causal factor in this accident. Please do not let that distract from my point.  What I point out here is the almost guaranteed fact this aircraft as well as numerous other B737 incident/accident aircraft, have experienced reverted rubber hydroplaning caused by the lateral play in, and, geometry of the B737 gear truck as explained in my reports. I would like to point out that if Air Carrier Xs aircraft had been experiencing the 'typical' viscous or dynamic hydroplaning that is typical of most accident investigation findings, then the runway and over run surfaces would have not been as perturbed as they have obviously been. I would also like to emphasize the very real and significant potential to lose lateral control in even the most mild crosswinds, with potential 'nil' braking as demonstrated above. This easily explains the numerous lateral runway excursions.Be advised that I am currently working in a foreign country, at a very conservative, Part 121 style Air Carrier, flying the B737-800. My company has recognized these problems and has set very conservative crosswind and landing distance limitations, especially on non-grooved runways. Some Air Carriers know there is a problem and have taken action to prevent accidents. In fact, my current employer has a limitation of only a 25 knots permitted crosswind on a 'wet' non-grooved runway even though the braking action is 'good.' Bear in mind that Boeing has a demonstrated crosswind of 33 knots for winglet installed aircraft. In conclusion, there continue to be excessive B737 runway departures around the world that are easily explained by my findings, and potentially preventable with at least additional aircrew training and awareness. Additional testing and crew awareness is the minimal acceptable conclusion to my findings and concerns in my opinion. I ask that action be taken for passenger safety on the B737.I have been very outspoken as to my grave concerns about the B737 landing gear geometry contributing to excessive hydroplaning, especially at low speeds. This issue continues to confound both crews and accident investigators. I need to point out that the A320 for example, with very similar weights and tire footprints, has not demonstrated this phenomenon as indicated by the lack of crew complaints and similar type runway excursions, especially in the slow speed regime. That slow speed regime is on the order of 80 knots or less, but is not limited to this speed regime. A perfect example, one of the many dozens, of this phenomenon that led to an incident, was at ZZZZ in a foreign country. This is what started out as a typical, wet runway landing, and ended with a runway end excursion.The crew indicated that at about 60 knots, maximum braking was accomplished and the aircraft acted like it was on ice. This phenomenon has been experienced by me numerous times in a B737-800 and has led to numerous runway excursions both laterally and at the end, as in this case at ZZZZ. This crew at ZZZZ flew within acceptable landing parameters, had approximately 1,500 feet of runway left, at 60 knots, and still departed the end of the runway. This crew's 'ice' comments are an all too common comment and continue regularly to surprise crews. The typical explanations of rubber deposits, non grooving, oily surfaces, long landing touchdown, etc., is disingenuous at best as other aircraft types are not demonstrating the same propensity to 'skid' as the heavier models of the B737 especially at slower speeds. I have yet to formally hear about my concerns a full year and a half after my first complaints. I have given all of my finding to my former employer who states my concerns are 'not safety of flight related,' with no further explanation given. I have written Boeing with no response. I believe it is the time to act before another serious runway excursion leads to injuries or deaths.Lastly, I would like to point out there is no evidence, yet, of a B737 near V-1, high speed, balanced field (stopping based balanced field), wet runway RTO. I am 100% convinced that if or when that happens, there will be a significant runway end excursion event, as the wet runway assumptions used by Boeing in this regime, do not apply based on my findings.				A B737-800 Captain revisits his concerns, using comparative analysis, that numerous B737-800 incident/accident aircraft have experienced reverted rubber hydroplaning on landing.

I asked them to check the forward lavatory and galley and overhead bins for any source that might be the cause and they indicated that they were already completing the search of those specific areas. They also had checked all personal electronics they saw being used for excessive warmth or hot batteries. During the discussion, I turned off the galley power and recirculation fan, informed the 'A' that we had shut off the power to the galley and asked them to report back in two minutes to see if there was any improvement. During this time, I referred to the QRH for guidance on any other trouble shooting ideas we could try. I also discussed the possibility of diverting with the First Officer if we could not identify and correct the problem quickly. After the two minutes, there was no improvement so I instructed them to turn off all fluorescent lighting in the aircraft (as recommended in the QRH) and call me back in another two minutes. While I was discussing the problem with the 'A' Flight Attendant, the First Officer obtained the ACARS METAR for our diversion airport and programmed the OPC. After the two minutes, the 'A' reported there was no improvement. (It should be noted that all three flight attendants could smell the fumes, as well as a few passengers). Also during the entire event, no fumes or other indications were evident in the cockpit. The aircraft's flight path was taking us toward our diversion airport, and at this point I informed the flight attendants that we would be landing and to secure the cabin for landing. I informed the passengers that we had an electrical problem which through an 'abundance of caution' required us to land in order for us to address it. We notified ATC and requested a clearance to [a divert airport]. They cleared us direct and gave us an initial descent to 17,000 FT. The First Officer ran the QRH for Smoke/Fire/Fumes on the aircraft and then the Smoke Removal Checklist. Those checklists were completed as we approached 10,000 FT, allowing both of us to focus on the task of landing at an unfamiliar airport near mountainous terrain. During the descent, Dispatch was notified via ACARS of our situation and intentions and the landing was uneventful. The time from top of descent to landing was approximately 12 minutes. We turned off the runway and were met by the airport fire/rescue trucks, and they immediately scanned the aircraft with and reported to us that there were no unusual hot spots or visible smoke. I informed the passengers and crew to remain seated as we would be taxiing to a parking spot on the airport. After shutdown, the fire crews did a more detailed inspection of the forward interior and could find anything unusual, and the passengers were taken by bus to the terminal. The 'A' Flight Attendant agreed to be my point of contact with that group, and Dispatch and Maintenance Control were contacted by phone to begin the process of accommodating our passengers and seeing to the maintenance needs of the aircraft.		[No additional information contained in second report.]		Flight crew of a B737-700 was notified of electrical burning smell in cabin, they declared an emergency and landed uneventfully.  The source of the smoke was unknown.

While I switched over I heard the autopilot disengage. Upon my check-in I said: '[Flight XXX] vacating one, one thousand for one four, fourteen, thousand, CONFIRM OUR ASSIGNED ALTITUDE.' The Controller responded: [Flight XXX], roger. Climb and maintain one four thousand.' The First Officer, however, held the climb in abatement, and I said something to him in agreement as I pointed to the TCAS traffic display. I then repeated: [Flight XXX], I say again, confirm our assigned altitude.'The Controller then responded in a stressed vocal tone: 'descend and maintain one zero thousand,' to which I responded: 'Vacating one, one, eleven, thousand for one zero, ten, thousand; traffic in sight.' The Controller responded to this readback in a tone that led me to believe he was still confused as to what had just happened. The First Officer and I discussed what had transpired, and I have a specific recollection of being irritated because I had stated our altitude three times, and twice included the specific request to CONFIRM [our cleared] ALTITUDE.' When we received our next frequency change I read back the clearance and commented that we had the traffic in sight and that as far as we were concerned we have no 'deal' meaning that I had no intention to pursue the traffic conflict with this Controller. The First Officer, who saw the conflict before I did, acted with forethought and [his timely l and appropriate precautionary action] prevented this from becoming a [bigger] problem. I always have been the first to provide peer education for safety and am willing to accept fault immediately. However, I honestly believe we were handed off in error.In that ATC is a compressed environment, I would like to see strict adherence to terminology of altitudes spoken i.e.: 'one-four, fourteen thousand' instead of the compressed and often used 'one-four thousand.' When an aircraft says 'CONFIRM ALTITUDE' it should generate strict attention from the Controller.		As we rolled out heading south, I saw an Airbus [that had departed ahead of us] approximately 3-4 miles in front of us and could tell that he had not begun to climb yet. Knowing that this was not 'normal' for an Atlanta Departure, (to climb before the aircraft preceding you climbs), and I clicked off the autopilot, leveled off and asked the Captain to verify our cleared altitude. We were at approximately 11,000 MSL at this time. Center immediately came back and said we were cleared to one-four thousand. I then began to climb again, but passing approximately 11,300 we received a TCAS 'TA' for an aircraft directly in front of us at approximately 5-6 NM at 12,000. In addition, I could visually see the aircraft and could see that it was flying directly toward us and would definitely be a conflict if we continued our climb. Therefore, I again leveled off at approximately 11,300 FT, and then began a descent back to 11,000. Had I not taken the initiative to level off when I first sensed a problem, we would have been at approximately 12,000 FT when we passed the conflicting aircraft! His same altitude, ultimately, we never passed closer than three miles and 1,000 FT. The potential conflict was simply happening too fast to take a 'wait and see' approach.		A B737-700, departing ATL and inappropriately cleared to climb to 14,000 MSL, avoided a conflict with a prior departure Airbus, opposite direction at 12,000, through the alert response of the First Officer/pilot flying who stopped his climb after spotting the traffic. ATC ultimately noted the error and cleared them to descend immediately to 10,000.

We tried unsuccessfully to restore any or all data, leaving us with no traditional electronic navigation. We had good ADI information, complete with speed, VSI and altitude information. Because of the late arrival and long duty day, coupled with the potential for complications, I elected to declare an emergency with Approach Control. We received a heading direct to the airport and flew a visual approach. We were able to use stand-by navigation for ILS information and good PAPI information. The approach and landing was otherwise uneventful. Company Dispatch, Maintenance and Flight Operations Duty Manager were notified.		Only ECAM was CABIN PRESS-set manual landing altitude.

While descending on an arrival, both A320 FMGCs failed causing lost precision and non-navigation data, so an emergency was declared followed by a visual approach.

Later, level at about 1,000 [feet] AGL for a fly by the Tower, we lowered the gear once again but this time we got three green lights.  The Tower took a look and said all looked good. We were then sequenced around for a landing during which we left the gear down and landed uneventfully. We stopped on the centerline while CFR took a look at the gear.  They all looked good so we taxied to the gate followed by the fire truck.				A B737-800 flight crew abandoned their approach when the left main gear failed to extend.

The checklist directed us to shutdown the left engine, complete the Engine Failure/Shutdown and One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklists. After completing the Engine Failure/Shutdown it directs landing at the nearest suitable airport. We continued to destination due to the facts that: the weather was great, we had over 1,500 feet of stopping margin, were very familiar with the airport and the quality of CFR and their familiarity with the B-737. Finally, it provided the best facilities to accommodate the passengers and gave us just enough time to run the checklists and review the boxed items in a expeditious and thorough manner. Although ZZZ was in the vicinity, it was an unknown quantity that would require time and attention to determine if it met the requirements of a suitable airport, dig out charts, get new weather, redo the performance numbers, brief the unfamiliar airport all while spiraling down into ZZZ while still needing to brief the flight attendants and passengers and complete the One Engine Inoperative Checklist. Instead we had a nice smooth trimmed stable descent into our destination, allowing us to complete our tasks in an unrushed manner. In fact we had just the right amount of time as we entered the traffic pattern shortly after completing the checklists and we were able to continue unfrazzled for a smooth approach and landing. When we cleared the runway CFR inspected us and confirmed the brakes were fine which agreed with the brake cooling numbers we ran. We then proceeded to the gate and said goodbye to the passengers who, with the exception of one woman, were in fine spirits and happily exited the aircraft. I am proud of the performance of the entire crew and I believe the simulator training we received prepared us well for this event.		A trimmed aircraft in a stabilized straight ahead, gentle descent seemed much more logical than a spiraling descent to ZZZ considering backing up the First Officer on checklists, performance data, Flight Attendant and passenger briefings.		The flight crew of a B737NG performed an inflight shutdown of their left engine and continued to their destination following receipt of a fuel filter bypass warning. The crew determined that continuing to their destination, already planned and briefed was wiser than starting the landing preparations all over again while spiraling the aircraft down to an airport immediately below them.

We had MEL 30-1C which instructs us to configure the bleeds and isolation valve differently until the temperature outside is at or below +10 degrees C. On our flight this meant having the isolation valve closed with the right bleed air switch in the off position until the temperature outside is at or below +10 degrees C, to comply with the MEL 30-1C.When the temperature outside reached +9 degrees C around FL190 I reconfigured the bleeds air system as per MEL 30-1C. I positioned the right engine bleed switch to ON and the isolation valve switch to AUTO. This was then followed by a right BLEED TRIP OFF light. I went to the QRH and followed the procedure for a bleed trip off. On completion of the QRH procedure both the left BLEED TRIP OFF light and the right BLEED TRIP OFF light were illuminated. This meant that we no longer had any pressurization due to no bleed air. We were just leveling the aircraft at FL250. We declared an emergency and descended to 10,000 FT, at which point we were able to reset both bleed air sources. After getting the BLEED TRIP OFF lights to extinguish, we noticed the temperature was above +10 degrees C and reconfigured the bleed system in order to be compliant with MEL. During this event the cabin never got above a pressure altitude of 7,000 FT. After contacting both Dispatch and Maintenance Control we decided to divert.				A Boeing 737-700 crew, conducting operations under the constraints of an MEL requiring modified bleed and isolation valve operation, experienced pressurization problems when both bleed sources tripped off during level-off at FL250. Specific MEL procedures were followed by the crew, but both bleed air sources inexplicably and automatically tripped off, compelling the crew to declare an emergency and divert to a nearby airport.

We were cleared to 'Descend Via' and were in VNAV Path.At about 16,000 near the TOTTT Intersection ATC advised us to expect radar vectors to the east side of the airport for a downwind and approach to [Runway] 35R. They then did so and also cleared us to descend to 11,000.The third ATC clearance change took place when they cleared us direct to FFFAT [a waypoint on the ANCHR arrival] and [to fly] the remainder of the ANCHR RNAV STAR. We proceeded direct to FFFAT in LNAV. We were just about over FFFAT and a few hundred feet above our 11,000 cleared altitude when ATC issued the fourth clearance change and told us to 'Descend Via' the ANCHR arrival.As per current technique on complex RNAV arrivals we set 9,000 [the ultimate low/hard altitude at DONTT in the ANCHR STAR] in the MCP Altitude window. However, our next fix after FFFAT, DOGGG, had a hard crossing altitude of 11,000. Because of multiple ATC route clearance changes, [two different] 'Descend Via' clearances and [the associated] high workload we failed to note the FMS was not in VNAV Path and descended below 11,000 to about 10,600 approaching DOGGG. We realized our mistake about the same time that ATC cleared us to level off at 10,000. We didn't conflict with any traffic and never received an ATC traffic call, TA or RA.The cause of this event was multiple ATC arrival clearance changes in a short amount of time combined with the new, overly complex RNAV arrival procedures (too many fixes with too many speed and altitude restrictions on the new procedures, which create a much higher pilot workload). Getting cleared on the MOLTN arrival; then getting vectors with a hard descent altitude; then getting recleared to fly the ANCHR (which is intended for arrivals from the east) and a clearance to 'Descend Via' lead us to make an automation error. When ATC modifies/switches RNAV arrivals in a short amount of time, errors can occur because of the increased workload created by looking up the new arrival, reprogramming the FMC and briefing the new procedure. When we were cleared to 'Descend Via' the ANCHR1 arrival we should have verified that we were in VNAV Path before resetting the altitude alerter from 11,000 to 9,000, the bottom altitude on the arrival. The normal arrival plan into Denver for the last past years (for me), has been to fly an arrival to the west side of the airport and then get a base leg vector to an approach on the west or east side. Making multiple clearance changes and clearing us from one complex RNAV STAR to another complex RNAV STAR [intended for arrivals] from the east (which we never fly) doesn't make sense to me. ATC should have left us on the MOLTN STAR or vectored us.		I set 9,000 in the MCP, the lowest altitude on the new arrival, as we routinely use this technique on RNAV arrivals with many step down altitudes. However, because we were vectored off an arrival, I came out of VNAV path descent mode and selected LVL CHG while on the heading. Because ATC changed our arrival plan multiple times and cleared us on a new RNAV arrival with very little lead time to look up new arrival, reprogram the FMC and brief, we used an inappropriate descent mode [when doing so was combined with] setting the lowest altitude on the arrival. The complexity of many of the new RNAV arrivals--with many step down altitudes and speed restrictions--increase pilot workload and when ATC switches RNAV arrivals with short notice errors can occur.		After receiving multiple ATC changes to their arrival routing, including two different descend via clearances for RNAV STARs intended for arrivals from both the east and west of the airport, the flight crew of a B737-700 failed to comply with the 'at 11,000 FT' crossing restriction at DOGGG waypoint on the ANCHR RNAV STAR to DEN.

We were very light and climbed through 11,000 FT quickly and neither of us were aware of a speed deviation.

We accomplished the immediate action items, donned oxygen masks and declared an emergency. We initiated a descent to 10,000 FT. As we continued with the ECAM the pressurization stabilized at a normal position. We quickly assessed that the cabin had never exceeded approximately 8,000 FT. Since the aircraft was stable we agreed that there was no need to continue down to 10,000 FT. We coordinated with ATC to level at FL250. We called the flight attendants and they said everything in the cabin was fine and the passengers hardly noticed anything. We then continued with SOP. We referenced the flight manual because the ECAM was complete and we were left with a pressurization system 2 failure. The Flight Manual states that if CPC 2 fails the number 1 system will pick up the load. That appeared to be what happened. After a lengthy discussion and a systems review we agreed that there must have been a system delay in the transfer of CPC control from system 2 to system 1 thereby leading to a partial loss of pressurization resulting in the ECAM. We then discussed the situation with Dispatch and Maintenance. After a lengthy discussion we all agreed that continuation to destination at FL250 was the best course of action. We terminated the emergency with ATC. Finally we made a PA giving a brief description of events to the passengers.		Shortly after level off in cruse an ECAM was annunciated depicting loss of cabin pressure and to initiate emergency descent. Both pilots noticed a small change in cabin pressure in the inner ear but not dramatic. The ECAM warning was silenced and the Captain began the emergency descent profile while the Copilot informed ATC and the cabin. Noting that the Cabin Pressure was still less than 10,000 FT and the situation was not a rapid decompression, a controlled descent was performed and not at maximum IAS. The ECAM steps were completed during the descent at about FL270 and automatic cabin pressure control was regained. Screens indicated a loss of cabin pressure number 2 controller and control was taken over by the number 1 controller. Cabin pressure was noted by the crew to be stable at about 7,000 to 8,000 FT. After checking all cabin pressure systems the crew requested a level off at FL250. A conference call was placed to Dispatch and Maintenance and the decision to continue was made in light of the only item lost was Cabin Press Controller 2. It was assessed that there was a temporary loss of pressure while cabin pressure control was automatically transferred to the number 1 system. Considering the aircraft maintenance status, weather at destination and all en route alternates, and fuel, it was decided to proceed to destination but remain at FL250 as a precaution.		A320 flight crew experiences a cabin pressurization anomaly at FL370 and initiates a descent. With the automated controller switching to CPC 1 and the cabin pressurization remaining below 10,000 FT, the crew elects to continue to destination and land uneventfully.

There are no QRH items for such a scenario and we unanimously concluded it was safe to proceed as along as the fire warning light and or bell did not come on again. We consulted with dispatch to be ready for a possible diversion and checked the weather at suitable airports along our route and made sure that our route keep us close to suitable airport at all times. The flight was completed without further incident. It was far safer to continue on that to land at an unfamiliar airport at night with no braking reports and no ground crew for an false warning indication.				B737-800 Captain reported intermittent false engine fire warning in cruise flight. After consulting with ground personnel the flight continued to destination.

Suspect loss of separation at altitude.Crew suspects two possible causes of event. Most likely is a controller error by Center. [Center] may not have correctly accounted for inbound other carrier's aircraft arriving from [adjacent] airspace. Another possibility is that Crew took climb clearance from FL360 to FL380 that was intended for another aircraft and that the incorrect climb readback was not detected by Center. A Company Flight Number was also heard on Center once we were handed off to new Center.		The Controller concluded with, 'Thanks for your help.' We were neither told to call anyone nor told to call a controller by any ATC agency the entire flight about the event.		B737-700 flight crew reported airborne conflict and a TCAS TA in climb to FL380. Captain speculated either ATC error or readback/hearback contributed to the event.

After planning and preparing to land on Runway 33L, new ATIS and arrival approach into CYYZ now landing 24R. Winds were previously 330/18G25, then 290/18. Toronto Approach stacking arrivals in very tight with their runway change and asking for the usual maneuvers (expedite descent from 5,000 FT to 3,000 FT and slow to 180 KTS, when the aircraft is 220 KTS and 5,000 FT assigned by previous Controller and turning left to HDG 310 between MAROD and DEKNI). OK, I ask for gear down, speedbrakes out, flaps 5, this is still do-able but not what we planned for. On final now, with Tower, we are following a B-757, minimum separation asked to keep our speed up, but after landing take first available high speed, C-2 (so flaps 40 are used). Approach is stable, but now we are encountering wake turbulence, or windshear or both. On a previous ASAP, I had a gatekeeper call about a flap overspeed in gusty conditions so I elected to land with flaps 30, for better aircraft controllability, and flap exceedance avoidance. This last minute flap change occurred close to 1,000 FT AFE. At some time after the flap change was completed, I recall seeing 1,420 in the altitude window (24R TDZE 546) so re-configuration occurred above 1,420 MSL, but nonetheless close. Remainder of approach stable, but gusty and working it right to touchdown (added a good amount of power, and raised the nose with flaps changing from 40 to 30) and reset MCP speed to flaps 30vref + 5 KTS, no big deal. Exited C-4 instead of C-2, Tower again asking us to expedite so aircraft following us didn't have to go-around, he didn't, and all worked out. I have yet to fly an approach into CYYZ (Toronto) where from the time we received the last most current ATIS and planned for the approach, landing, runway distance, and turn off on the runway in use, it did not change to an entirely different runway. Approach Control asking for the slow down, and expedite descent simultaneously, along with Tower asking for 'keep your speed up, but take the first available exit and expedite the runway' clearances are becoming notorious in CYYZ. This is going to end badly for someone. On a previous flight into CYYZ during one of their last minute runway changes, [another] pilot informed Approach they were now clearing flights for approaches and landings to the new runway and that current weather was below minimums for the new runway. So they changed it again, to another runway, all in about 5 minutes. As for myself, if fuel is not a consideration, I am going to start exercising the 'go-around' option with greater frequency, rather than try to make something good out of something bad.				Air carrier Captain expressed criticism of the way CYYZ handles inbound aircraft.

N1 was fluctuating between 100-70 percent. As you would expect, this caused substantial aircraft yaw. The F/O (Pilot Flying) immediately recognized the condition and executed the QRH memory items for engine surge by disconnecting the autothrottles and pulling back the thrust levers to about mid range. Simultaneously the Number 2 engine began to fluctuate but to a lesser degree of approximately 95-80 percent. After about 15-30 seconds with the thrust levers in the reduced position, both engines stabilized at approximately 70% N1. Our flight was approximately 20 miles northeast of the departure airport when this event started and the weather was clear with unlimited visibility. We quickly determined that returning would be our safest course of action. ATC gave us vectors back to the field and we landed without further incident. On landing roll, both Number 1 and Number 2 ENG CONTROL lights illuminated. Upon arrival at the gate, Maintenance was notified and the aircraft was subsequently taken out of service.		During climbout passing through approximately 11,000 feet, the Number 1 engine started to fluctuate in N1. The fluctuation was severe enough to cause significant yaw. I disconnected the autothrottles and reduced thrust to maintain engine limits. Shortly after that the Number 2 engine started fluctuating also. Further thrust reduction on both engines to about 70% seemed to stop the variations. We accomplished the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall Checklist. We then requested a return. Once we turned south and descended, we were handed off to Approach and cleared for the visual approach. During the descent and approach phase of flight, the engines seemed to operate normally. Normal landing and taxi back to the gate were uneventful.		B737-700 flight crew experiences fluctuating N1 on the left engine climbing through 11,000 feet. Auto thrust is turned off with no change then the thrust is reduced until stability returns at about 70 percent N1. The right engine also experienced brief N1 fluctuations and the crew returns uneventfully to the departure airport.

Just as we started to configure the aircraft, we got an ECAM message stating that the flaps were locked due to the actuation of the wingtip brakes, with a note not to exceed 200 knots. We were at approximately 2,500 feet at the time and executed a missed approach and notified ATC. We were given vectors and an altitude. The Captain kept control of the aircraft staying well below 200 knots and took over ATC communications. I pulled out the Manual and searched for the appropriate procedure. Per the slat/flap indicator on the upper ECAM, our flaps appeared to be 0, while the slats were working just fine. Since we had recently switched over to the 'new' Manual, we both were determined to ensure that we were accomplishing the right procedure, along with the right landing distance calculations and corrections to our landing/approach speed. Not only did we maintain a continued dialogue throughout the whole event, but I went thru the procedure several times, and we even handed over controls so that he (the Captain) could review the Manual procedures and make sure that we got it right. We notified company and had a message relayed to Maintenance, hoping to get some helpful guidance. The message back was just to follow the Manual. In the meantime, we were vectored around for another visual. There was very little traffic in the area so we were not really concerned with sequencing behind other aircraft.  We discussed our landing distance calculation (5,000 feet or so from what I can recall) and we discussed our landing speed, which would be flown 25 knots faster per the procedure, and decided as a precaution, to have emergency equipment standing by. We briefed the flight attendants, got new weather (VFR still) and completed appropriate checklists. We just treated it as a slightly faster than normal landing using max reverse, low brakes, with everything else being fairly normal (other than the flaps.) It was an uneventful approach to an uneventful landing. The emergency vehicles followed us to the gate and we were met there by our Maintenance personnel. One issue concerning this event was that while trying to involve Maintenance in the process, we received word from them that we should just follow the procedure. Fair enough, that is just what we did, but we would have liked to get them more involved in the process, as we value their opinion on all matters mechanical. They may not have had anything to tell us that would have made any difference in the actions we took, but it's always nice to have them in the loop during these kinds of situations and to receive some kind of helpful feedback. Secondly, I do not want to speak for the Captain, but for me, trying to follow an unfamiliar 'new' Manual procedure for a no-flap landing with partial slats was a bit unnerving. The procedure itself is really fairly simple now that we have seen it and ran through it in real time, but it IS different than the old procedure that I ran in SIM training. We spent a lot of time during this event running and re- running the procedure, when it could and should have 'flowed' better. I think we knocked out all the appropriate checklists, but I just can't be sure. Overall, I think we did a good job, but I personally would have felt more confident about it with a recurrent SIM (with the new Manual) under my belt.				A320 First Officer reports a flap fault with wing tip brakes locked during approach. A go-around was initiated in order to comply with new procedures. Eventually a zero flap with slats 3 approach and landing ensues, flown at Vref+25 to an uneventful landing.

Enroute we requested and received landing data and determined no issues existed with our planned landing. On descent through approximately 8,500 feet MSL for landing at the Captains (PF's) direction I placed the landing gear handle in the down position with no resulting gear extension. We completed the ensuing ECAM and QRH procedures for the L/G Gear Not Down Locked event without success and accomplished a go around. The go-around was normal considering the aircraft configuration. Established on a downwind we successfully accomplished the L/G - Gravity Extension QRH procedure, declared an emergency due to the loss of nose wheel steering capability, and completed a normal approach and landing with approximately 4,000 FOB.		At cruise the LGCIU #2 ECAM appeared. On final approach when landing gear was selected down nothing happened. Following ECAM procedure the landing gear handle was recycled, with no effect. We went around. On downwind we manually extended the gear and got three green indications. Landed normally and cleared the runway at the high speed turnoff and stopped (No nose gear steering). Tug came and towed us to the gate.		A320 flight crew reports failure of LGCIU Number 2 in cruise. During approach the landing gear fails to extend when selected, and the gear handle is cycled to no avail. A go-around is initiated and the landing gear gravity extension procedure is followed successfully extending the gear.

We were configured and descending on the glide slope. At about 5 miles from the runway Tower called traffic at 11 o'clock. They stated they were not in contact with them and intentions were unknown. We began looking to see the traffic and saw it on TCAS. It was about 3 miles away. The terrain and buildings on the ground made it impossible for us to visually acquire the traffic. Then the TCAS target went to a TA. We were still trying to find the traffic and then the TCAS RA occurred. I started a shallow climb to comply with the vertical guidance. The traffic passed 450 FT below us, and we were never able to see the other aircraft. After clear of conflict received, we reported the TCAS climb to the Tower. Then I started to descend again and recaptured the glide path. Then we made a normal landing.

We were advised that tire fragments had been found and that they thought they could have come from our aircraft. In the course of conversations with the different agencies involved, we also heard that the fragments found were too small to be identified with our particular aircraft and what the ground-based crews had found indicated that the entire tire had been 'exhausted.' We immediately initiated a synoptic check of our aircraft, keying on the FUEL and GEAR pages. The landing gear page indicated that all tire pressures and temperatures were normal with no notable variations. In addition, there were no abnormalities in the fuel system or any other systems in the synoptic pages reviewed. There were no EICAS messages received. Based on those indications, we contacted [Company Operations] and relayed all of the information. We received a reply stating that 1) the original call was made to all aircraft departing within a certain timeframe (not just ours), 2) Maintenance Control found no abnormalities in their system monitors of our aircraft, and 3) The Duty Officer concurred with the decision to continue to our planned destination. Repeated checks enroute verified that there had been no indications of tire damage/loss of pressure and no fuel problems. The landing was totally uneventful as was taxi to the ramp. However, after exiting the aircraft, we saw maintenance personnel clustered around the right main assembly. The number 12 tire, although still fully inflated, had suffered a separation of the entire tread belt. Resulting damage was evident on the trailing edge of the wing (flap) and access panels on the underside of the right wing in addition to numerous rubber scuff markings throughout the entire area. After reflecting on this event, the only other piece of information that I can add is that at V1 the RFO and I noticed both airspeed tapes momentarily stop their normal acceleration and stagnate for about two seconds at about 160 KIAS. There was no yaw or any other abnormal indications for the entire flight.		Narrative 2 contains no additional information.		B777-200 flight crew was notified by ATC of tire debris found on the runway during the timeframe of their takeoff. After verifying that all tire and fuel system indications were normal, the flight was continued to destination where post flight inspection revealed that the entire tread belt of the number 12 main tire was missing.

As we could not restore the Green Hydraulic system, we informed Dispatch that we would hold to burn off fuel to landing weight. On landing, Green Hydraulic system restored itself to normal and we taxied to gate. Maintenance had worked on the Green system before departure and possibly had not bleed the system before return to service, according to them.				A330 Captain experiences failure of the landing gear to retract after takeoff followed quickly by failure of the Green hydraulic system.

Miami to Sao Paulo, B777. Other aircraft: New York to Sao Paulo, B777. Both aircraft highly accurate GPS navigation capability, flying the same published STAR at the same time. Saved by TCAS RA. Without TCAS or clear weather, the mid-air collision geometry would have been two aircraft on the same course and altitude, colliding in straight and level flight, with approximately 100 KTAS closure, the trailing aircraft closing on the leading aircraft. Both aircraft unsuccessful communicating with Brazilian ATC at time/location of event. Common problem in vicinity of PIR on PIRA5 arrival. Previous experience suggests both aircraft flew beyond VHF range/altitude capability of ATC without a successful handoff. Captain pilot flying. First Officer pilot not flying. First Officer returned from rest break, assumed pilot not flying duties 20 miles prior to TUBE as aircraft descended to FL200. On PIRA5 arrival, leveled at FL200. No TCAS targets in view. Passed over TUBE level at FL200, requested lower altitude from Controller. No response. Repeated request three times, no response. Able to hear foreign language conversation on frequency. Level at FL200, 10 miles south of TUBE, pilot flying and pilot not flying observed new TCAS target precisely at six o'clock position, less than 3 miles. Target observed less than 1,000 FT above; target descended to co-altitude.As target closed to minimum range for RA parameters, TCAS RA directed a climb. Pilot flying executed accurate RA response, climbing slightly above FL220 and then leveling at FL220, with no change in course. Air to air comm on primary VHF established with TCAS target aircraft: Other aircraft stated that he had us in sight, and was at our right 3 o'clock low. (Other aircraft maneuvered off course to the right and did not climb). Pilot not flying gained visual contact with TCAS target as it moved from 6 o'clock to 3 o'clock. Pilot not flying confirmed with other that they also did not have contact with ATC on primary VHF. Pilot not flying switched secondary VHF to 121.5, and immediately heard ATC (unknown ATC callsign/station) directing us to contact Approach on (new frequency). Pilot not flying switched primary VHF to new frequency, announced to approach control TCAS RA climb to FL220, and received instruction to hold present position, left turns, FL220.) directing Air Carrier X to contact approach on (new frequency). Pilot not flying switched primary VHF to new frequency, announced to approach control TCAS RA climb to FL220, and received instruction to hold present position, left turns, FL220. Descended in holding, rejoined STAR, landed Sao Paulo. ICAO is at least TWENTY YEARS LATE in standardizing procedures to get aircraft offset from the magenta line provided by our highly accurate GPS navigation. Mid-air fatal catastrophes such as the collision with Gol airlines in Brazil a few years ago prove the point, to no avail. Our high technology GPS navigation achievements are leading us to fatalities via mid-air collisions. We play a game of chicken every night flying in South America...it is by far the most obviously senseless procedure in commercial aviation -- not offsetting. See my similar near mid-air ASAP over Colombia a couple of years ago.The failure of ATC to affect a handoff in the vicinity of PIR on the PIRA arrival into Sao Paulo is a common problem. Our Flight Department should obtain Commercial Chart FD on our iPads. Among other obvious benefits its display of ATC boundaries and frequencies would enable us to more quickly overcome the common ATC problem of handoffs near VHF coverage limits, while we wait (for how long?) for Brazilian ATC to upgrade its radios into the modern era of commercial aviation. Our pilots should be trained in the simulator to EXPECT danger in foreign countries, and BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED when flights are uneventful. The 'Domestic mindset and domestic scenarios' in the simulators represent the high quality US ATC system. A better standard training scenario would be foreign locations with their sub-standard equipment, language barriers, and higher degree of difficulty.		[No additional information contained in this report].		Two Boeing 777's, proceeding to the same destination and on the same and routing, were alerted to an impending mid-air collision by their respective TCAS RA's, and both aircraft followed their TCAS avoidance commands. Both aircraft had lost communications with ATC.

The Agent said the FAA was at the aircraft. As I walked onto the airplane, I found a gentleman in civilian clothes in the cockpit arranging personal effects, sweater, briefcase, etc. I assumed that the man was with the FAA, but after saying hello, I asked for his identification. He provided it and in turn asked for mine. The Inspector provided me with the flight deck access document from the Company Gate Agent. I did not ask the Inspector why he was on the aircraft without crew permission because I did not know if he had the authority. Also, I did not want to create a more adversarial atmosphere since we would be together for the next three hours. After a thorough cockpit safety inspection and preflight, I did talk to the Inspector about my concern for his identification because of Company heightened awareness about cockpit access and I was just doing my job. Normal pre-departure, departure, and cruise followed. During cruise the First Officer needed to use the washroom. I briefed the Inspector on Company procedure for flight deck access and entry during flight and his specific duties. I coordinated with the flight attendants and unstowed my oxygen mask. When the flight attendants gave us the all clear, I donned my mask and headsets and gave a thumbs-up to the First Officer that I had the aircraft and to the Inspector that he was clear to open the door. The Inspector exited followed by the First Officer. The Inspector returned and shut the door. Then, to my surprise, the Inspector made his way into the First Officer's pilot seat, using the thrust levers and yoke to assist. The thrust changed, but the autothrottles corrected. The autopilot disengaged from LNAV to CWS ROLL. I re-engaged LNAV. I was unable to communicate rapidly enough with the mask on to stop the Inspector. I did not physically try to prevent the Inspector from sitting in the pilot seat because I felt any confusion or unanticipated movement would be even less safe. When the First Officer called on the interphone, the Inspector rose, made his way to the cockpit door, used the peep hole, asked me if it was okay to let the First Officer in. I said yes and he let the First Officer in. The rest of the flight was completed normally. I don't believe the Inspector had any bad intent in the situations above, but his presence combined with his unanticipated actions created quite a distraction.

When writing this report, I listened to a website that archives ATC recordings. The LAS Tower Controller cleared the preceding aircraft for takeoff on Runway 25R. The Controller then cleared us to line up and wait, Runway 25R, full length, which I acknowledged. The Controller then cleared us for takeoff. I could see that the preceding aircraft was still on the runway, in its takeoff roll, and approximately through only half of its takeoff roll. A jetliner does not start the takeoff roll and lift off in 26 seconds. Seeing this, I refused to accept our takeoff clearance. I quickly decided to not acknowledge our takeoff clearance at all thinking that a comment of 'standby' or something similar could imply a problem of some sort with our aircraft. Therefore, I felt that no acknowledgement was the best course of action, and I did not start the takeoff roll. The Controller asked us, 'Company Flight Number, did you copy, cleared for takeoff Runway 25R, maintain visual separation with Company?'  Still, the preceding aircraft was on the runway. I delayed my response until I could see the preceding aircraft start rotation. I completed my response, 'Company Flight Number yeah, we copy, cleared for takeoff Runway 25R.' By the end of my transmission, the preceding aircraft had rotated. This Controller cleared us for takeoff while the preceding aircraft was still on the runway, not once, but twice! It took 48 seconds for the preceding aircraft to start the roll and liftoff, and yet the Controller cleared us for takeoff after only 26 seconds (first time) and 37 seconds (second time) had passed in his 48 second takeoff roll! I've seen this occur at LAS many times before, and the controllers do not effectively manage this hazard, in fact, they cause it. I have had multiple wake turbulence encounters due to LAS departures being so close to each other as well. I know LAS Tower is under a lot of pressure, but it's clear to me that LAS controllers often go way outside the envelope (and regulations) to push departures and arrivals to unsafe and/or risky levels.				Air Carrier departure from LAS expressed concern regarding ATC's use of 'anticipated' separation on successive Air Carrier departure aircraft.

The weather at the time was partly cloudy with no convective activity in the area. Approximately five seconds after receiving the PWS warning, the weather radar went into test mode. The pilot not flying and I briefly discussed the situation and I made the decision to land with no objection from the pilot not flying. After parking at the gate, I called for the Maintenance person at STL and described to him what had happened. He stated that this was a common occurrence at STL and there was nothing wrong with the aircraft so no logbook entry was made. The Maintenance person stated this was a known problem and 'they' (I don't know who 'they' are) recently flew an aircraft around STL to try and isolate the cause of the erroneous PWS warnings, but were unable to find the cause.	The reporter stated that he has not personally seen or heard of this type anomaly occurring before it happened on this flight. The PWS warning symbol identifying the supposed weather event was at the aircraft's eleven o'clock about five miles. The reporter did not see anything which would cause that warning to activate.	At 500 AGL on final approach, we got a windshear go-around warning. There was no convective activity in the area and no windshear warning. The Captain and I talked about it and he elected to continue the approach and landing without incident. Five seconds after the initial warning, the radar went into test mode automatically. After the landing, the Captain contacted STL Maintenance to check out the radar and he was told that erroneous windshear warning has happened multiple times before.		A B737-700 flight crew reported an EGPWS Predictive Windshear Warning (PWS) while on short final for STL Runway 12L, but because daylight VMC conditions existed without convective activity, the approach was continued.

Subsequently, I noted we had both a split flap and a flap disagreement. In addition, the flaps indicated less than flaps 1 degrees. I immediately began to assess the situation, noting our limited fuel state of 5,900 LBS, the short runway length, and our current flight control problem. I looked at the overhead panel and noted that all the Flight Control LED lights were green and we had no hydraulic lights on. Everything on the overhead panel appeared normal. I directed the First Officer to advise ATC of our situation and requested vectors to work our problem.Due to our limited fuel state and the short runway, we did not have time to remain in our filed destination's area and troubleshoot the problem. We needed to be decisive. We needed to proceed to a suitable alternate. I advised the First Officer that I would fly the aircraft and run the radios while he troubleshoots the problem and ran the appropriate Emergency Checklist. I advised ATC that we were declaring an emergency and requesting vectors to a nearby Class B airport. The Controller immediately requested our fuel and passengers on board, and subsequently gave us a discrete frequency.While the First Officer was accomplishing the appropriate Emergency Checklist, I was setting up for the ILS Runway XX approach. I have flown and worked with First Officer on a number of occasions. He is the consummate professional, who is poised when exposed to pressure situations. There was a good division of the workload, so I focused on the aviating, navigating, and communicating while the First Officer focused on running the Emergency Checklist. I attempted to follow along while he ran the appropriate Emergency Checklist, but due to the dynamics in both the cockpit and surrounding area (i.e., communications and coordination with ATC, Tower, ARFF, aviating, navigating and running normal and Emergency Checklist), I may have (and understandably so) missed some of the items read by the First Officer on the Emergency Checklist. I remember asking the First Officer twice to clarify the approach speed. ATC vectored our aircraft in a box pattern while we completed our checklist and prepared the aircraft, cabin crew, and passengers for landing. The flight attendants received their emergency briefing (i.e.,TEST information) and subsequently I briefed the passengers and reassured them that everything was going to be OK. Turning final, the First Officer ran the radios and Landing Checklist, and I configured the aircraft early (i.e., call for the gear once established on the localizer) and flew the approach at 180/185 KTS. We advised Tower that in the event that we had to go-around that we would fly straight-out. Subsequently, we had a smooth and uneventful landing. After landing, Airport Rescue and Fire Fighters (ARFF) approached our aircraft and gave us an aircraft status reported that nothing unusual was noted. We proceeded to the gate and Maintenance boarded our aircraft. As we discussed the event and flight control problem in detail, the Mechanic revealed that there were 7 previous documented write-ups on the flight controls. FYI- I never noted any flight control write-ups in the aircraft logbook. Everyone worked well together and did a great job.I'm sure there were things that we could have done better, things that I may have overlooked. Maybe I could have accomplished a few things or items in a different sequence to provide a cleaner, smoother flow. However, from the aviation prospective, for the most part, I think we covered and accomplished what needed to be done to bring our valued passengers, crew, and aircraft to an uneventful and safe conclusion. Company mechanics are under a lot of pressure to get airplanes fixed and in the air. I recognize that aircraft systems and equipment are going to fail, and it may take several attempts to find and fix a mechanical malfunction. However, with 7 previous documented flight control write-ups, it is in my view that this aircraft should have been taken out of service and fixed well before this inflight no flap/no slat emergency landing occurred.		[The narrative contains no additional information.]		A B737-800 Flap Asymmetry Fault activated at flaps 1 selection so an emergency was declared and the flight diverted a nearby airport for an uneventful no flaps landing. The event was this aircraft's seventh such event.

We discussed the loss of nose wheel steering, reverser one and no green brakes. We contacted Dispatch and coordinated a divert. We then reviewed the landing distance procedure and decided it was safe to land. Although I was the pilot flying at the time of the hydraulic loss, the Captain decided that he should land the aircraft. I then became the pilot not flying and reviewed the Overweight Landing Checklist since we weighed about 149,000 LBS. After we declared an emergency with ATC, we were given vectors direct to the field. We ran all appropriated checklists and alt extended the gear about 7 miles out from the FAF. The Captain made a very smooth touchdown and decided to exit the runway via the high speed. We then stopped the aircraft on the high speed, set the brakes and ran the tow in checklist. We were then towed in.		[Narrative #2 contained no additional information.]		A320 flight crew experiences a Green Hydraulic System failure due to fluid loss climbing through FL180.

We noted that the left IRS was showing a very large error, over 25 miles at the time and growing. We consulted the QRC, FOM, Flight Handbook and Systems Manual for guidance as to specifically what the error meant and how to handle it. We cross checked our remaining navigation information and determined the right IRS was working properly. We notified Dispatch via ACARS, and contacted Commercial Radio to let them know of our navigation failure as per guidance in our manuals. We continued to carefully monitor and cross check our position and performed several extra plots on our plotting chart to ensure our position was correct. Our position was indeed correct operating on the good IRS. We also began monitoring a coastline VOR as soon as it was in range and used it as an additional check to continuously verify our position. After radar contact with Center, and after beginning our descent the left IRS generated a FAULT annunciation and apparently failed as the Captain's flight instruments failed. The First Officer then became the pilot flying. We then declared an emergency and got radar vectors to the airport. The checklist was consulted and that restored adequate instrumentation for the Captain to continue flying. We then landed uneventfully and wrote the discrepancy in the aircraft logbook.				An air carrier flight, eastbound over the Pacific Ocean, suffered a single IRS failure and eventual loss of the Captain's flight instruments. The flight continued utilizing the First Officer's instruments and IRS data.

Start up, taxi and takeoff was normal. The takeoff required the use of flaps 15 due the gross weight which was 611,000 LBS. ATC directed a heading of 320 and a climb to 3,000 FT after takeoff. I called for heading select after gear retraction and began a turn at 400 FT AGL. As soon as the turn was initiated I saw a flock of 6-10 birds immediately in front of the aircraft. One bird hit the center of the forward windscreen and I heard two thumps in very rapid succession. We were at approximately 180-190 KTS at impact. Although my windscreen was covered with bird tissue, the windscreen was not damaged and visibility was not impaired. I looked at the engine panel to access any engine damage and observed a red over temp box around the right EGT. There were no other indications of engine damage or stress. We operated the engine normally for the remainder of the flight. I called for flaps 5 to begin the flap retraction process. Realizing that the bird encounter would necessitate a return, I instructed First Officer to get us a level off at 3,000 FT MSL versus the new cleared altitude which was 10,000 FT. At the same time we saw that an area of weather within 10 miles on our nose would require immediate attention. There were other aircraft making radio calls on the frequency and we were unable at first to make it known to ATC that we had taken several birds strikes with potential engine damage, needed to remain at a lower altitude than our last clearance and needed to make an immediate right turn to avoid severe weather. We elected to declare an emergency at that point. After that, our handling and communications became much smoother. I instructed the Relief First Officer to contact Dispatch and Maintenance Control. I instructed the second Relief First Officer to inform the Lead Flight Attendant of our status and our intention to return. After that he was to make appropriate announcements to the passengers. We obtained clearance to 7,000 FT for fuel jettisoning. Rather than holding ATC put us on a series of vectors in the area. First Officer began fuel jettison in accordance with the Emergency Checklist. At first our intention was to dump to maximum landing weight, 460,000 LBS which would take about 27 minutes. We had about 225,000 LBS at the beginning of jettison. We discussed our options for landing. We were concerned that the same area of weather the necessitated our immediate deviation on initial climb could possibly delay or even prevent our return. Maintenance Control gave us the okay to land overweight and Dispatch sent us the appropriate landing data. First Officer coordinated an immediate return and reviewed the Overweight Landing Checklist. We stopped jettison at 5,000 FT in the descent with about 148,000 LBS remaining. A 30 flap landing with autobrakes 3 was planned. First Relief First Officer reviewed the Diversion checklist on her company issued iPad. The landing [and] rollout were normal. We exited the runway, stopped the aircraft and shut down the right engine for inspection by the emergency crew. Rather than restart the engine for taxi or taxi overweight on one engine, we elected to have the aircraft towed to the gate. Weight at touchdown was 533,000 LBS with 147,000 LBS of fuel on board.		Captain continued flying, First Officer handled radio communications, the other Relief First Officer talked to the flight attendants and passengers, and I talked to Dispatch and Maintenance Control. They were on the line within 1 minute. We discussed our issue and decided our plan of action was to return to inspect the damage. Dispatch then patched in Maintenance Control to discuss the engine damage aspect and the possibility of an overweight landing. They agreed with our continuing to use the engine while monitoring it for future issues and gave us the OK for an overweight landing if needed. They also entered the problem into ACARS at my request, so we could offload some of the work of the non-flying pilot. Dispatch then changed our destination and sent us our landing weight limits.		B777 flight crew describes the crew actions after several bird strikes at 500 FT AGL on departure. An EGT over temperature is noted initially and the crew elects to return to the departure airport. Fuel is dumped but approaching weather leads the crew to terminate that process and land overweight.

Halfway through the arrival we asked SEA Approach to deviate 10 degrees right for weather. Approach cleared us for deviation 10 degrees right and instructed us to follow the descent path of the arrival. We asked Approach for a specific hard altitude 'hard' altitude because we were no longer on the arrival, since we were deviating off course. Approach would not give us a specific altitude and cleared us to maintain the descent profile of the arrival. At this time multiple airplanes were requesting a similar deviation because of weather near the arrival and therefore the radios were very busy. At no time was the airplane more than a mile or two to the right of course. After deviating for weather the Approach Controller then cleared us direct to the last fix on the arrival and instructed us to maintain the descent profile of the remainder of the arrival (which included 2-3 additional fixes between us and the last fix on the arrival.) We preceded direct to the last fix but also overlaid the remainder of the arrival over our path to maintain awareness of the arrival and the descent profile. We landed in SEA shortly after. Approach was assigning us a bogus clearance. There is no way to maintain the descent path of an arrival if we are not flying on the arrival path. Once we deviated from the HAWKZ arrival, approach should have issued us a specific altitude to maintain and provided us our descent clearance. We as a crew should have refused to descend via the descent profile and required a specific altitude for further descent.				When weather forced a B737NG flight crew to deviate from the HAWKZ RNAV STAR to SEA they were unable to 'descend in compliance with the descent path of the complex procedure as requested by ATC. When they so advised ATC they were given the same clearance.

While climbing through 11,000 and approaching 280 knots, ATC directs, 'Expedite climb through 14,000.'  Speed intervention selected and dialed in 265 knots.  Perhaps 2-3 seconds later TCAS announces, 'Traffic.'  Target appears on ND 1,300 feet above and directly ahead perhaps 3-4 miles, maximum.  Acquired visual contact and determined that a RA was likely going to happen within seconds.  Not knowing the other aircraft type or intentions, I made the decision to stop climb below the target aircraft and turn left approximately 20 degrees.  While announcing this to the First Officer and executing the changes, but before telling him to notify ATC, ATC orders us to turn left 15 degrees and stop climb at 12,500. As this is happening, I observe the target aircraft, a Cessna Caravan, turning to a westerly heading and several skydivers departing the aircraft.  We were a bit busy at this point in time, and I did not note the exact distance or altitude separation at the closest point, but I estimate we were less than 1,000 feet below the Caravan and less than 2 miles away.  This is after deviating from the original ATC clearance to avoid a potential conflict.  Absent the deviation, a RA or worse would have been the result.  In my opinion, human error on the part of ATC. They were aware of the jump aircraft, and yet we were assigned a heading and altitude that caused a TA.				B737 Captain reports an airborne conflict with a C208 dropping skydivers.  ATC was in contact with both aircraft and issued last minute heading and altitude instructions to the reporter to avoid collision.  A TCAS TA was annunciated.

The First Officer who was flying reacted quickly and applied forward pressure on the yoke, then rotated at or near VR.  At some point he also trimmed  about two units nose down to correct the problem.  The trim was still in the green band.  Enroute we contacted Dispatch/Load Planner and got a print out of the exact distribution of cargo.  The numbers were very close to the planned cargo from the load sheet.  We made the assumption that the aircraft was truly loaded as the print out indicated.  Who really knows?   We had a very light passenger load which can cause an aft CG issue on the 737.  This, in theory, should also been built into the weight and balance plan assuming passengers sit in their assigned seats.  I'm willing to bet the marketing folks didn't consider this issue when deciding to charge more for the front of the aircraft.  I had the flight attendants move about 10 passengers forward in the cabin.  At no time was the aircraft out of safe CG range just farther aft than expected.  When I landed (on a weekend) I called the Chief Pilot on call.  My intent was to get the word to the station folks to make them aware and hopefully remedy the issue.  No one answered the phone and no voice mail was offered.				B737-800 Captain as the NFP reports the aircraft nose beginning to lift prior to V1.  The flying First Officer trims the nose down and rotates at Vr.  The trim setting remained in the green band the entire time.

We had difficulty staying logged into CPDLC while crossing the North Atlantic. Upon reaching [our] destination, Ramp Control didn't have any idea who we were and where we were supposed to park. With a 9 hour flight time, you would think that Dispatch would have had plenty of time to notify every ARTCC and our own Ramp Operations of the call sign change.		On initial level off, Maastricht Center gave hand off to another Maastricht Center frequency and advised 'they have a question'. On initial check in with new frequency, we were queried on what our Aircraft registration number was. Moments later we were advised that there was a Flight XYYXA on frequency 30 minutes ahead of us with the same destination. About 3 - 5 minutes later, Maastricht told us we might have difficulty with Shanwick for crossing with CPDLC and to anticipate questions. Shortly thereafter, we were told to change our call sign on flight to our registration number, so our call sign now became 'NXXXXX' - from that point on in the flight, there were constant difficulties, and confusion regarding who we were, what we were all the way to destination- when finally [our destination] Tower did not even know what type aircraft we were. The NXXXXX was changed in the FMS so the aircraft would log onto CPDLC properly. Multiple difficulties across North Atlantic with same, both Shanwick and Gander. We did finally get logged on twice once with Shanwick and once with Gander, however were unable to log onto domestic CPDLC passing St Johns with Moncton. We informed Dispatch of the required name change with Maastricht from the start. They seemed confused by same. We were advised that usually the Alpha designation solved all these type problems, however not in this case. Multiple opportunities for missed radio calls, since every ATC agency called or referred to us as something different. All 4 pilots had difficulty with call sign at various times as well. Choose different flight numbers when two aircraft of same type are crossing in same airspace. The 'A' designation is insufficient to prevent confusion.		B777 flight crew reports ATC confusion when an extra flight section uses the same flight number with the addition of an Alpha, on a flight from Europe to North America.

As we were holding short of 28L we were given clearance to cross 28L and line up on Runway 28R. The First Officer put in the changes to the box and briefed me on the new V-speeds. They were roughly the same as the numbers for 28L and I specifically remember that V2 was 140 KTS. As we turned onto 28R I looked down at my PFD and saw V-speeds. I also asked him if he was ready and he said yes. When we were cleared for takeoff, I advanced the throttles to the MAN/FLEX detent. As we began rolling, we got a Master Caution with a 'ding.' I assumed that the flex number had dropped out of the FMC so I advanced the throttles to TOGA to continue the takeoff. We were light and there was quite a bit of wind so the airspeed jumped up and we accelerated very quickly. I was waiting for the V1 call when the First Officer announced that we had no V-speeds displayed on the PFD. At that point we were approaching 160 KTS which I knew was well above V2. I felt it was safe to continue the takeoff and that it was a better decision than to abort at a speed well above V1. I believe that the First Officer changed the runway correctly prior to entering 28L but either hit the wrong button or didn't push hard enough for the runway insertion to take. As we started the takeoff I believe he inserted the change and that's when the speeds dropped off the airspeed tape. By that time I was completely outside and the 'ding' distracted me from my FMA check. I just went to TOGA and thought everything was normal except for the lack of a flex temp.				When an A320's throttles were set to MAN/FLEX, a Master Caution and 'DING' alerted but the Captain continued the takeoff after the FMC dropped the V speeds because the First Officer did not fully finish the runway change input from SFO 28L to 28R.

But was using the I-pad and had the zoom in function in use for the brief (we both did and both missed the 250 KIAS restriction). Have added a note book for station info that I have started to use to avoid this in the future.		While briefing the ORD7 Departure, I failed to notice the 250 speed restriction on the plate because I zoomed in to better visualize the altitude restrictions on the center of the departure plate. I did not read the entire departure down in the lower right corner of the plate or the upper right corner. Above 10,000 FT we accelerated to 300 KIAS per climb profile and ATC queried about our speed. We confessed our speed and slowed down to 250 KIAS.Failed to read the entire departure procedure. The 250 KIAS restriction is something new to the ORD7 DEP since I had last flown it. I think the iPad may have been a contributing factor because the ORD7 is a 2 page departure, therefore font is small but this does not excuse me from not reading the entire procedure.		An Air Carrier crew departed on the ORD7 and accelerated to 300 knots because they had zoomed in on the iPad looking at the altitude restrictions and missed the speed constraint because it would outside of the selected viewing area during the brief.

(Restriction on the ILS 05R is 160 knots). Within 1 mile of intercept ATC clears us to 9,000 FT, 700 FT below route minimum. Well below chart MVA. THEN 'turn left 070 climb and maintain 12,000 FT, we have a no comm aircraft in the area.' Gear went up we started the turn (still close to the SMO 160 radial), ATC immediately reclears us for the ILS 5R approach. (This is the first clearance for 5R ILS. Everything up to this point was just vectors for the 160). Heading approximately 150, altitude 9,300 FT. We climbed back up to meet the 9,700 foot transition altitude, requirement met all stabilized approach requirements and landed uneventfully. We were in visual conditions the entire time with the runway in sight with very good terrain S.A. We briefed the DATUL2A and terrain considerations very thoroughly. Our willingness to help ATC was not an issue until rapid fire clearances then it was crazy busy. My suggestion would be to say 'unable' and break off early take the vector above the MVA's.

The Yaw Damper had kicked off and could not be reset. We then noticed that the flaps had barely started to move and had not gone to the commanded position. There was an asymmetry indicated. I declared an emergency to Approach and told them we had a flight control problem and we would need vector to accomplish the checklist. I first went to the Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry Checklist, which due to the actual configuration led me to the ALL FLAPS UP LANDING checklist. After running the checklist and checking with the advisory landing distances for abnormal configurations table and adding a safety margin similar to that used in computing certificated landing data (an additional 60%) since I was not interested in using max manual braking and maximum reverse thrust, I determined that it wasn't prudent to land on 17l and requested a runway with at least 10,200 feet of available runway. ATC offered 17C and I accepted. We briefed the flight attendants and let SOC know about the emergency and proceeded to execute a visual approach to RWY 17C. Weight was approximately 127,000 pounds and ref speed was around 180 knots. I touched down and used reverse thrust and spoilers to decelerate until 60 knots when I used the wheel brakes. I passed on the info to ARFF that I had not used wheel brakes until 60 knots and had no concern for hot brakes and requested taxi to the gate. I taxied to the gate uneventfully. Conferred with Maintenance about the problem, talked with the Dispatcher and finished the IOE paperwork for my student.				While approaching to land and upon initial configuration of aircraft, the Boeing 737-800 crew received a Master Caution warning and FLT CONT light. The yaw damper had also disconnected and could not be reset. An emergency was declared and all of the appropriate steps were accomplished prior to executing an all flaps up landing at about 180 knots. Aircraft was then taxied to the gate uneventfully.

Traffic continually landing 4R. On pushback, we were asked if we wanted 31C. Said yes. We were cleared to lineup and wait 31C. We acknowledged and then lined up. Then we were cleared for takeoff. I read this back verbatim, 'Heading 250 cleared for takeoff 31C Company Flight Number.' But, I think ATC MEANT to clear holding traffic on 4R for takeoff instead. Anyway, an aircraft had to go-around on 4R shortly after we started our takeoff roll.		Departing MDW primary runway in use was 4R. Ground asked if we could accept 31C. We advised we were able 31C. After all required checklists completed, we were cleared to line up and wait 31C. There were several aircraft on final for 4R. Tower then cleared Company aircraft to line up and wait on 4R. As traffic cleared 4R, Tower cleared us, 'Company Flight Number, cleared for takeoff. No delay.' Without delay we began our takeoff roll. At about 80 knots, I heard Tower and Company aircraft on 4R discussing who was cleared for takeoff. Tower instructed an aircraft on final for 4R to go-around. We continued as my outside scan indicated no threats. Tower then repeated, 'Company Flight Number, cleared for takeoff.' Takeoff and climbout were normal and uneventful. Upon reflection, it is apparent that the Tower Controller cleared our aircraft for takeoff on 31C when he meant to clear Company aircraft for takeoff on 4R. Tower Controller seemed briefly unaware of what he had done, but recovered nicely by acting quickly to instruct aircraft on final to go-around and to re-clear us for takeoff, so there was no confusion on our part. Tower definitely cleared us for takeoff and, as is often the case, without delay. Had I been aware of how close the aircraft on short final was to touch down (1.5 miles maybe?), I could have questioned the clearance. But, the controllers at MDW are so competent at multiple runway departures and traffic flow, we assumed he had time to clear us for takeoff and then clear Company for takeoff on a crossing runway with no problem. This was not a near-miss situation. It was just a Controller who cleared the wrong aircraft for takeoff but then responded appropriately to his mistake.		B737-700 flight crew read back the takeoff clearance and started their takeoff roll from Runway 31C at MDW, ATC directed an aircraft on final for Runway 4R to go-around. Flight crew suspected the takeoff clearance may have been intended for an aircraft lined up and awaiting clearance for takeoff from Runway 4R, thus precluding the use of the runway for the go-around aircraft.

He started talking about a possible go-around. I changed my focus further down the runway and saw an emergency vehicle clearing about midfield on the north side and didn't notice any other vehicle following across the runway. I made a decision to continue to land, which went uneventfully and, while clearing, the First Officer queried the Tower about the truck. We had heard nothing from Tower at all. The Tower Controller said there had been a communication error with the truck. We heard the Tower Controller ask the truck to call them. We proceeded to call our ATC Specialist to get him in the loop.		I was pilot not flying. The approach was uneventful until approaching 100 FT. I looked inside to make the 100 FT call and realized the aircraft had the voice callouts. I looked up [after that] and saw an emergency vehicle rapidly crossing the runway at midfield. I said, 'What the heck?' I started to tell the pilot flying to go around as we approached 50 FT, but the vehicle was going so fast (30 to 40 MPH) that, by the time the pilot flying looked up, the runway was clear. The pilot flying landed the aircraft uneventfully and we queried the Tower Controller to see if he had noticed the incursion. He said it was a communication error and told the truck to contact the Tower and sent us to Ground. We taxied to the gate without incident and called the Company ATC representative.		B737 flight crew reports an emergency vehicle crossing their runway as they are about to touch down. The approach is continued to landing as the vehicle is moving quickly.

Landed uneventfully and proceeded to the gate. Through communicating with the flight attendants on the flight, we did know that the passenger oxygen masks had in fact deployed and that a POB was used. The crew was met at the gate by Station Maintenance, which took over the aircraft. It does not state in the QRH anything about starting a descent with the bleed trip off after turning the associated pack off. Maybe it should!				A B737-700 left bleed tripped four times climbing to FL380 and the pack was turned OFF. Shortly thereafter the right bleed tripped several times and finally with both bleeds OFF an emergency was declared and the flight diverted but not before the cabin exceeded 14,000 FT causing the masks to drop.

At cruise flight, FL300, 50 NM east of ZZZ1 fix, the flight attendants chimed us that there was smoke in the cabin. There were 150 souls onboard the aircraft; one Flight Attendant in the fourth jump seat and one Cockpit Observer in the flight deck. I was pilot not flying. I answered the call. We immediately performed Smoke in Cabin Memory Items, put our oxygen masks on, and established communications. Captain took the radios and continued as pilot flying and I questioned the flight attendants as where they thought the smoke was coming from. They stated it was coming from the back part of the cabin. I advised the Captain and we declared an emergency immediately. I had them check the rear lavatory and the aft galley, and had them feel around for any warm areas. Also, had them turn off the lights. They then said the smoke seemed to becoming from just aft of the over wing portion of the plane. Said that there was a smoke haze and could smell a strong, sweet, smoke odor. I then advised the flight attendants to continue to check where the smoke maybe coming from. We then ran the QRH. I read the QRH and had the Cockpit Observer follow along to double check. Closed the bus tie relay, turned off the galley power, switched the equipment cooling fans to alternate, and turned off the recirculation fan all advised via the QRH. The Captain also followed along. Called the flight attendants and they said that the smoke was dissipating. We were just about 150 miles from ZZZ and, since we felt we had the problem under control and a handle on it, decided to continue on to ZZZ under emergency priority knowing that ZZZ2 would be a good alternate in case the issue would become worse. The Captain continued to fly the aircraft and talk on the radios to ATC while I worked with the flight attendants and continued to run the QRH. Via the QRH, I isolated the packs and turned the right pack off. The flight attendants stated that the smoke had all dissipated at this point. The Captain advised Dispatch during this point. We decided since the issue was under control to leave the right pack off even if the problem was already isolated to be safe. We also continued to ZZZ under an emergency and landed with no other issues. Upon landing, advised Ground that they could wave off emergency fire and rescue. Also, called Operations to have Maintenance waiting at the gate. Passengers deplaned with no injuries or issues.				When the B737-700 flight attendants reported smoke in the cabin the flight crew immediately donned oxygen masks, initiated the immediate action and follow up checklist items during which the smoke dissipated.  They declared an emergency but, since the smoke had dissipated and the source appeared to be contained, continued to a safe landing at their destination where they canceled the emergency and turned the aircraft over to Maintenance.

The restriction at LENSE Intersection is to cross at or above FL240. ATC gave us a clearance to descend now to FL300 and then cross LENSE at FL240. The First Officer set 240 in the MCP and started our descent to FL300. At that time, we encountered some wake turbulence, which rolled the aircraft into a 20 to 25 degree right bank and the autopilot disengaged. The First Officer quickly resumed control and had to apply almost full left aileron to stop the roll, yet the aircraft remained in the bank for two to three seconds before the wings rolled level. He returned the aircraft to a stabilized profile and then re-engaged the autopilot with the aircraft back LNAV and VNAV PATH.I did not notice that we had forgotten to change the 'at or above altitude' at LENSE to a hard altitude of 240. It was in our descent through FL290 and about eight miles from LENSE Intersection that I noticed we were not going to make our altitude and reported it to ATC as we crossed the intersection at approximately FL260. They then gave us a clearance to descend to FL240. The flight continued to BNA without any further problems.				B737-700 Captain reported a wake vortex encounter on descent into BNA that provided enough distraction they missed a crossing restriction.

We were not the last aircraft to land on the south flow so we didn't think they turned the runway to a north flow yet. We turned off on the high speed Taxiway D5, transitioned to WB, and taxied eastbound toward the ramp. While we were still on the high speed Taxiway D5, the Ground Controller gave us clearance to taxi on WB, turn north on F, and transition to CN to the ramp. The Controller did not give us any hold short instructions. While we were on WB, we looked down 16L and did not see any aircraft taking off on 16L. The Controller then told us to stop which we did, and we then saw a Beech 1900 cross above us while landing on 34R! The Controller apologized and cleared us to continue taxiing to the ramp. We crossed the hold short line that protects the final approach for 34R. We did not see the Beech 1900 because we thought the airport was still on a south flow and we didn't hear a hold short command. We were also distracted by the many aircraft on the ground taxiing to and from different runways while a runway change was underway. We wanted to make sure we didn't cause any problems to aircraft on the ground and we weren't thinking about any airborne threats. I will be more diligent to look BOTH ways when I cross under the approach path of a runway.		As I was receiving a response from Ops, the Ground Controller urgently called, 'Company Flight Number, STOP!' The Captain immediately stopped. As I looked out my window, I saw a B1900 in landing configuration approaching Runway 34R. As we watched, the B1900 appeared to execute a go-around.		DEN Ground Control issued a B737 crew clearance to the gate after it landed on 16R then issued it an emergency stop after the aircraft taxied into the Runway 34R Runway Safety Clearance Zone while a BE1900 on a Runway 34R final executed a go around.

I was also the pilot flying with my First Officer as the pilot not flying. We were being vectored by NCT from over OSI VOR for a visual approach to Runway 28L at SFO. We were directed to descend from 8,000 FT to 6,000 FT and speed 210 KTS while on a base leg. Approach Control notified us of traffic for [Runway] 28R as an Airbus 320. We reported traffic not in sight. We were given a heading to intercept the final approach course for [Runway] 28L, and directed to slow to 180 KTS. We still did not have traffic in sight. Approach Control cleared us to 5,000 FT then gave us a rapid sequence of speed reductions to 160 KTS then to final approach speed. At this point we were getting high for a normal approach profile to the runway. My First Officer then confirmed visual with the traffic and we were cleared for the visual approach to [Runway] 28L. We were handed off to SFO Tower Controller near the San Mateo Bridge. We were still a little high and at minimum approach speed. Tower instructed us not to pass the Airbus. We were nearly wingtip-to-wingtip at this point, around 4 to 5 miles out on final. Tower asked the A320 to speed up 10 KTS. We continued to a landing on [Runway] 28L. I feel that safety margins were threatened during this approach for several reasons. The approach took place at dusk with diminished daylight. This made it difficult to make visual contact with the traffic approaching [Runway] 28R. The close spacing as vectored by Approach Control created a heavy workload in the cockpit. There was zero room for error as we tried to maintain visual with the traffic, reduce speed to minimum speed, and then fly a steeper than normal descent profile. The converging courses of the two aircraft and our descent rate triggered a TCAS RA advisory. Our relative higher altitude over the Airbus created a situation where I momentarily lost visual contact with the traffic due to visual cut-off angle from the left seat. I was relying on my first officer and TCAS to maintain separation. Our minimum approach speed was faster than the Airbus and there was insufficient in-trail separation. I called the SFO Tower and NorCal Approach by phone to discuss the issue and voice my concern and displeasure with this arrival. In retrospect, I probably should have initiated a go-around when I, as the pilot flying, lost visual with our traffic. There are, in my analysis, several causal factors that created this situation: When conducting visual approaches, it is common for us to plan a flaps 25 landing instead of using flaps 30. The approach planning takes place before top of descent. The approach speed for flaps 25 vs. flaps 30 is approximately 7 KTS faster. I believe ATC assumed we would make visual contact earlier than we did. The altitude and speed assignments created an unacceptable lateral and in-trail spacing given the low light conditions at dusk. The lack of separation then created an undesirable approach condition for our aircraft. The arrival rate at SFO at the time was high enough that NorCal was perhaps trying to 'squeeze' aircraft spacing. This may have been a different, even acceptable, situation if it involved two narrow-body aircraft. The fact that we were a 'heavy' aircraft put more limitations on us. I would offer these recommendations for consideration: Our company and/or the FAA should notify all pilots that the approach flap setting for heavy aircraft should be selected to allow the slowest approach speed when conducting closely spaced parallel visual approaches. This would mitigate the potential 10 to 20 KT closure with the other traffic. Approach Control should plan a minimum of 1-mile in-trail separation for heavy aircraft when paired with narrow body or light aircraft for simultaneous visual approaches to 28L/28R at SFO. This distance can easily be lost once the lead aircraft begins to slow to final approach speed. Approach Control needs to be aware of the change in lighting at sunset. The visibility reported by ATIS does not necessarily translate to in-flight acuity during low light conditions. In closing, this vector to final would not have been accepted at night or in dark conditions. Any deviation left of the [Runway] 28R centerline by the A320 would have put both aircraft at risk of a potential mid-air.		During vectors to approach to [Runway] 28L we were told to follow an Airbus we initially could not see and then when we could see it, we had to slow down significantly while still descending because the Controller kept us too high. We were able to slow down and get the aircraft stabilized within our flight manual parameters but ATC had to ask the Airbus to speed up or we still would have passed the aircraft.		Air Carrier on final for Runway 28L at SFO voiced concern regarding ATC handling with regard to staying behind an A320 on final for Runway 28R.

It would have been very helpful to know this information earlier in order to brief and setup for glideslope out of service approach or LNAV/VNAV approach. Also heard that an aircraft in or near the protected area may have caused the glideslope problems. Pass the word and protect the ILS areas during IMC operations.

The nose wheel began to shimmy. As airspeed increased while still on the runway, the shimmy began to intensify. Liftoff was otherwise normal except while the nose gear was retracting, an unstable swiveling oscillation of the nose wheel created vibrations that were heard and felt throughout the entire aircraft, until about a minute after gear retraction into its up-locks. Then my First Officer and I began to smell an unusual odor. At first it smelled like melted cooking butter, but then the odor changed to some kind of burnt food, to finally an odor of burnt rubber. At no time was there ingress of smoke or caustic fumes to the flightdeck or cabin. To confirm this I turned on the cockpit dome light (since it was night time.) A look of all engine parameters showed normal. I asked my First Officer (pilot not flying) to pull out his O2 Mask and don it, and called for the QRH Smoke/Fire/Fumes, and Aircraft Smoke/Fumes Removal Checklists while I placed both air conditioning packs to high flow (to remove the odor). Both the 'A' and 'B' Flight Attendants were on the intercom telling me they were discussing the smell and that passengers were also concerned. Flight attendants described the odor as burnt butter at first, or food, later more as burnt rubber, but when asked they agreed it was just a smell, it was NOT electrical in nature, and not caustic, and that they did not observe any smoke. I concurred. I told my flight attendants I would make a PA to alleviate the passengers' concerns. Meanwhile, my First Officer was referencing the QRH and, at that time, the packs in high flow caused the smell to completely dissipate (but we continued to monitor all systems, and continued to be vigilant.) I considered the QRH checklists complete. As an additional resource, I contacted my Dispatcher, and asked him, 'Will you ask Maintenance Control is there any history on this aircraft, including any history of any of our fleet having experienced the smell of burnt rubber after a shimmying nose wheel retraction?' My Dispatcher replied that Maintenance stated we may have blown a nose wheel tire, but otherwise, there was no relevant history to pass on. By this time we were far out of radio range of Tower to find out if there were any remnants of rubber on the runway. At this point, it was agreed no safer course of action than to continue on was warranted, and Dispatch suggested having the fire trucks standing by on landing. Based on the realization from Maintenance that we may have a nose wheel tire blown, consideration was made for a possible evacuation, although minimal, but not impossible. So I briefed the flight attendants to prepare the cabin, but I added I believed it was highly unlikely, and was only a precaution. I made a second PA informing the passengers with a brief description, and saying...as a precaution we have asked the Tower to have the airport fire department on standby, so don't be alarmed by the presence of the fire trucks. We completely expect this to be a normal landing ... erring on the side of caution ... the flight attendants will be yelling out their commands, as they are trained to do, so please follow their instructions, and please don't be alarmed. At this point, the impact from continuing the flight was mitigated by absence of smoke, fire, or fumes. The new incident was that of the integrity of the nose wheel on landing. Landing runway distance was more than adequate. I briefed my flight attendants to review their tasks, and what our intensions were. My First Officer and I reviewed our QRH evacuation procedures and what our intentions were to each other. Stipulated we could not perform a go-around once on the ground due to possible FOD of nose wheel tire(s) debris ingesting into engine(s). Upon lowering the landing gear, I observed three green landing gear down indications, and informed the Tower. We asked Tower what frequency the fire rescue was monitoring, and he stated, you may switch to them now. Then my First Officer informed fire/rescue of our intended touchdown point, and that it was our intention to stop on the runway for nose gear inspection. A normal main gear landing was made (without autobrakes, so as to avoid a heavy load on the nose gear by deceleration forces), but when the nose wheel touched down, we immediately felt the same vibration and shimmying effect of the nose wheel on rollout, as we did on takeoff. Braking was smooth and gradual. We came to a complete normal stop easily. I set the parking brake, turned off my landing lights (since fire/rescue were approaching the aircraft from the front), but kept all other lights on, until they inspected the nose gear and gave the all clear. Once the fire/rescue departed, we continued to our gate and shut down. A logbook write-up was made, with close consultation with my Dispatcher, Maintenance Control, the Chief Pilot on Call, Contract Maintenance, [and] then Crew Scheduling for duty time and an engine run at the gate.On post-flight inspection of the nose wheel bay, it was noted that the spin-down pads (snubbers) had an inordinate amount of rubber, a lot more than usual according to contract Maintenance. Additionally, there were splattering of rubber matter throughout the ceiling of the gear bay. The strut appeared to be over inflated in my judgment. I also suspected that tire pressure was higher than usual, which would account for the rubbing of the hot shimmying tire upon gear retraction, which in my estimation was the cause of the rubber being super-heated, which caused parts of the tread of the tire to melt, and then be thrown about in the gear bay area. It (bits of rubber) had to be in a melted state, because it stuck to the surrounding area, where it cooled and stayed intact. It could not have been in anything other than a melted state, because of the way it stuck to the ceiling of the gear bay. Prior flight crew must have experienced the nose wheel shimmy on their landing, but when the aircraft was handed off to us; their comment was 'it's a good airplane.' We were completely taken by surprise when the nose wheel shimmy occurred to that degree of intensity having not occurred on the prior landing.		Shortly after reaching 80 KTS, the nose wheel began to shimmy. As aircraft airspeed increased, the shimmy intensified. The takeoff was continued since at no time did we believe that the aircraft was unsafe to fly. Rotation was normal and Pilot Flying (Captain) called for landing gear up. Positive rate was confirmed and landing gear was selected to up. When gear retracted into the wheel wells, the nose wheel spinning against the snubbers created a pronounced amount of oscillation and vibration before the nose wheel came to a stop. At this point we were climbing out, being handed off to Departure, retracting the flaps per SOP, and flying out on profile. After climbing through 10,000 FT, we began to discuss the situation in more detail as to what caused the smell and vibration. We both came to the conclusion that the nose wheel was most likely the issue. The Captain decided to confer with Dispatch and Maintenance to use all resources available and make sure we had all the information possible. We were still proceeding to destination since there were no other problems. The Captains' communication with Dispatch took some time, but finally, they suggested that one of the nose wheel tires could have blown. While this had not seemed likely to us, we then thought it could have been a possibility. At this point we were well on our way and, between Dispatch, Maintenance and the Captain, it was decided that the best course of action was to have the fire trucks ready in case we had a problem with the nose wheel. While we did not believe there would be a problem, we thought it would be best to err on the side of safety and have the trucks ready. With the weather being good and the availability of a long runway, we calculated our landing data (flaps 40 for slowest possible speed at touchdown) and determined it was acceptable. Descent, approach, and arrival were uneventful. An emergency was declared. We were given landing clearance and also allowed to communicate directly to the fire trucks. We coordinated with Tower and the trucks that we would bring the aircraft to a stop on the runway and have the trucks access the nose wheel. A soft landing was made and the nose wheel was lowered gently. Upon contact of the nose wheel to the runway, there was noticeable shimmy and vibration. Aircraft was brought to a stop and we told Tower and the trucks that the aircraft was stopped and the parking brake was set. The fire trucks approached the aircraft and firemen inspected the nose wheel and gave us the all clear.		B737-800 flight crew reports a strong nose wheel shimmy above 90 KTS during takeoff and continues. The vibration continues after gear retraction and eventually a burnt rubber odor is detected. Flight continues to destination where an emergency is declared and a normal landing ensues, with nose wheel shimmy again detected when it touches the runway.

We were IMC at -55 SAT. Turned engine ignition and engine anti-ice on and engine returned to normal operation in about one minute.		At FL400 flying over a tropical storm, we noticed ice was building on the window and windshield wiper. Temperature outside was a minus 55 degrees. The First Officer and I discussed turning the engine anti-ice on even though the temperature was -55. I looked around the HUD to look outside at ice buildup when the First Officer said we just lost the Number One Engine. I then turned the igniters to FLT and turned both engine anti-ice to ON. The Number One Engine reduced to 65% N1 and stabilized. I pushed the throttles up to get additional power and after approximately 30 seconds to one minute the Number One Engine came back up to speed. We left the anti-ice on until in the clear. No further events and we landed in our filed destination. I contacted Dispatch and they contacted Maintenance. I contacted the Chief Pilot. Maintenance said the aircraft was good to go and that when a sensor ices over it defaults to 65% N1.		A B737-700 Number One Engine rolled back to 65% N1 while flying at FL400 over a tropical storm with ice forming on the windshield at -55C. After the igniters were selected to FLT and the engine anti-ice turned ON, the engine recovered in about 30 seconds.

The ATC Controller told us of traffic ahead, 12 o'clock descending to 34,000 FT and after passing you he will continue to descend. At about 7-8 NM (approximately 20 seconds from the event) we noticed on our TCAS that the aircraft directly ahead of us was at 33,800 and still descending, arrow still next to it indicating more than 500 FPM, I inquired to the ATC Controller, is he going to level off, to which I'm not sure what he responded since things happened very quickly at this moment due to our closure rate. Next thing we see is 500 FT on the TCAS, at that moment the other aircraft breaks out of the clouds the TCAS goes to TA for a fraction of a second, then immediately to RA, descend, and the Controller is saying turn left now. The First Officer disconnected the autopilot, started turning and descending at that moment the traffic was over and behind us at approximately 300 FT according to the TCAS. From the time the TCAS sounded to the event being over a maximum time of 6-8 seconds elapsed! The other aircraft was a B-737 (military) according to ATC and we never heard any communication between the ATC controller and the aircraft in question.Having military aircraft transmit on MHZ frequencies when operating in commercial RVSM airspace could have provided us with some situational awareness since we would have heard what was being said between them and ATC. Also, checking into why the TCAS didn't provide the normal sequence from TA to RA at the proper time would be worth investigating!		I disconnected the autopilot, turned left, and began a descent. I noted the target symbol showed +300 FT and still descending as it passed over us. The other aircraft was a military 737.A contributing factor was the cloud layer that prevented us from seeing the 737 until they were directly in front of us. We also never heard any communication between ATC and the 737.		TCAS TA and RA warnings were instrumental in separating the reporter's A320 and a military B737 which descended below its cleared altitude. Situational awareness was cited as a result of ATC and the B737 not communicating on the same frequency as civil operators.

We discovered the FLT CONT SYS B low press light on the overhead panel. We followed the QRH. After completion of QRH procedure we were left with System B flight controls un-powered. A System A loss would have put us in manual reversion. After having done that in the simulator I didn't want to expose myself or my passengers to that risk. I made the decision to divert. Prior to the diversion I notified Dispatch and talked to Maintenance Control to confirm systems status. Diversion was coordinated with ATC and was uneventful until talking to Approach. We were assigned Runway 35R I told them I would require a longer runway due to the degradation in flight controls. I was then assigned Runway 31R than runway gave us a direct crosswind and I didn't want that with the loss of the yaw damper. I told them I needed Runway 35C for operational reasons. Controller said 'understand you are declaring an emergency?' I said if that is the only way to get [Runway] 35C then yes. We were then cleared for [Runway] 35C and landing was uneventful.Pilots in general don't ask for things they don't need. So when I asked for a long N-S runway a little more consideration from ATC could have been given.		A storm was over the area, lots of circuit breakers and moderate chop so we descended to improve the ride and better control. We asked for [Runway] 35C for operational reasons but were then assigned [Runway] 31R - that would have been a decent crosswind with no yaw damper, some inoperative spoilers and the R reverser powered by the standby system. We elected to declare an emergency to get the longer runway (this was the only way Approach was going to give it to us). Normal landing and taxi to gate.		A B737NG flight crew elected to divert to a nearby airport when the B Hydrualic System failed thus eliminating one of two sources for multiple flight controls. The crew declared an emergency in order to land on the longest available runway and into the prevailing wind.

We then got a Number 1 Engine low oil pressure warning. I then retarded the thrust lever on the Number 1 Engine. The oil pressure fluctuated between 28 and 32 PSI so the warning would go out momentarily but mostly stayed on. All other engine indications looked normal. The airspeed was starting to decay so I pulled up the driftdown page and told the Captain we needed to start down to FL270. He declared an emergency with ATC and they cleared us down. I then started a drift down descent. The Captain then ran the low oil pressure QRH that led to the Engine Shutdown Checklist. We then shut down the Number 1 Engine. It looked like ZZZ was the closest airport so we started a diversion there and I continued the descent. The Captain notified Dispatch, Maintenance Control, the flight attendants, and passengers of what was happening. He then ran the Single Engine Approach and Landing checklist and prepared for a flaps 15 landing. By that time we were on approach to [the airport], he then took the aircraft and landed uneventfully and taxied to the gate.		[Narrative 2 contained no additional information.]		A B737 experienced a Number 1 Engine failure due to low oil pressure. The crew declared an emergency and diverted.

The alert was generated by a tethered balloon in Restricted Airspace. I have flown into this airport numerous times and this event did not take us by surprise. We had briefed this restricted area earlier in the flight and both had terrain displayed on our NDs. As we arrived in the terminal area, I pointed out the obstacle on the ND and explained how we would most likely be vectored into the airport. The First Officer and I were both well aware that we needed a turn and conveyed that to Approach Control, who was vectoring another aircraft on a left base. Immediately thereafter, we received the caution and prior to receiving a vector we received the warning. It was obvious the terrain avoidance maneuver would not be appropriate in this situation. The autopilot and autothrottles were disconnected and a hard right turn at approximately 40-degree angle of bank was used. During the turn, ATC told us to fly heading 150. I had already overshot that heading by 20 degrees and immediately corrected back to the 150 degree heading. I can't say whether or not we had entered the restricted area. We were then vectored to an uneventful visual approach and landing.On the ground, I contacted Approach Control by telephone and we discussed the situation. The Controller said he had the tethered balloon displayed on his screen but was delaying the vector because of spacing with the aircraft on left base but was just about to turn us. He stated adding to his predicament was the fact that we were co altitude with the other aircraft. We were assigned that altitude by the Controller he had just relieved after asking for lower to get out of the bumpy cumulus clouds. I explained our warning system to him and we discussed steps that may be taken in the future to prevent a situation such as this. We could have notified the Controller sooner for our need for a turn.		[No additional information is contained in this report.]		During approach the Boeing 737-700 crew was vectored by ATC on a course that conflicted with a tethered balloon restricted area. The EGPWS activated and the crew took immediate evasive action.

Since I was the pilot flying and could no longer control the aircraft I said 'your aircraft, your aircraft' to the Captain. The Captain took control of the aircraft and rejected the takeoff. In our conversation following the event, the Captain stated that he was unsure of the reason I gave him the controls and that he didn't see my seat slide back, he only heard the 'bang' made by my seat hitting the back stop of the track.Also, during the seat failure, I momentarily pulled back on the flight controls and was unable to maintain directional control with the rudder pedals. The Captain stated that the sound accompanied by the aircraft gyrations caused by the sudden seat shift along with the confusion of being given the aircraft suddenly was what led him to his decision to reject. The reject was uneventful with plenty of stopping margin. We went to a holding area while we confirmed break cooling information and then coordinated a gate return with Operations Maintenance elected to replace my seat.I normally check my seat once I slide it forward for the final time before flight by pushing back against the pedals. For whatever reason this time, it still let go. I probably could have stated more clearly what had happened to help the Captain make a better decision; however, during takeoff there is not much time for a lot of words.		I heard a loud thud, the aircraft then began to rotate (VR 135), and the First Officer stated, 'You have the aircraft.'		The Captain of a B737-700 took control and rejected the takeoff when the First Officer, the original pilot flying was unable to control the aircraft due to a failed seat latch which allowed his seat to slide full aft and he was unable to maintain directional control as a result.

I elected to land 30 flaps in lieu of 40 flaps as briefed since we were stabilized at that flap setting (30) and would not have been stabilized at 1,000 FT in landing configuration if we had selected flaps 40. We had to use drag devices, flaps and gear to get down on the entire approach at their upper limits vs. the lower limits.In retrospect, I wish that I had asked for a 360 turn or a breakout/rerun to slow things down. I allowed ATC to put me into a situation where I thought I could recover and still maintain all SOPs. In the future I now have some parameters outside the final approach fix to draw upon where I will say unable request 360 or vectors for new approach.				ATC leveled a B737-800 at 6,000 FT for traffic and once cleared for the ILS 24R the crew was rushed for the approach and landing preparation after become VMC at about 1,500 FT.

Since we were expecting 22L, I entered the new runway in the FMC. Even selected 14LX in the FMC, as X was listed for intersection U2. What neither of us caught was the TPS data was for full length 14L. The ensuing takeoff was long! We both realized our mistake, and after the climb went over the TPS very carefully. We were probably 4,000 pounds too heavy for the runway. Stop the aircraft before the runway, and make darn certain the CORRECT RUNWAY AND INTERSECTION is what's displayed on the TPS and the correct flaps/thrust setting correlates with it. I was distracted by a circuitous and unfamiliar taxi route and I should have asked my Captain to take some time, short of the runway to review the unfamiliar data. He was taxiing slowly, but I was still playing catch up.		Prior to taxiing planned Runway 22L for departure, max power, 26K, due to winds (ATIS: 090/07 knots), weight and runway length, First Officer's Leg to Fly. On taxi out assigned Runway 14L at U2 intersection. With a long taxi to 14L ( via A, A6, J, hold short 9R then further clearance G, E, U), First Officer went heads down to pull new TPS. With New TPS we updated runway, headings, flaps, power setting, etc. With a call for takeoff data and bugs I took the TPS and began reviewing the data in the FMC. My first item was to verify the runway intersection was correct and as I accessed the FMC takeoff pages the First Officer pointed out the runway information, on the FMC, to confirm he had put in X/14L, in my estimation, for the new TPS 14L at U2 intersection, which I confirmed from the TPS that U2 intersection was indeed called 14LX. Confident the TPS that was pulled was for 14L at U2, I went straight to the flap settings v-speeds etc., and bypassed the first item listed in that row (the actual runway associated with that TPS which was 14L and not 14LX). Before Takeoff checks were completed and the flight cleared for takeoff. During takeoff roll aircraft performance indications were normal (N1, ground speed, etc.), however, remaining runway length became questionable if we had to abort. Continuing takeoff roll to V1/VR resulted in a much less than comfortable fly off point, on what I estimated, as less than one thousand feet of runway remaining. An inquiry to the Tower, for current winds, yielded winds at 100/09 knots, which was an approximate 4 knot headwind. Subsequent reviews, of possible causes lead us, almost immediately, to the TPS where we discovered it was pulled for 14L (full length 10k+ ft) and not 14LX (7310 ft). During the flight, we conducted a lengthy and complete review of the entire how, where, when and whys, on the proper procedures in retrieving, updating, managing, and verifying, TPS, runway and FMC information. I recognized the seriousness of this incident and have taken all possible steps to ensure this and any similar event is avoided in the future, to the best of my ability. I fully understand that the safety, conduct and successful completion of every flight under my command is my responsibility and I will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure the completion of my duties.		B737-800 flight crew reports departing Runway 14L from Taxiway U2 at ORD without verifying that U2 is an authorized intersection in the TPS [Takeoff Performance System] preplan. The result is a lift off point very close to the end of the runway.

During the flight the weather was again good but minus 43 showed on temperature. During the flight we checked two more times and temperature was dropped from weather report. I figured the station realized it and [deleted the] temperature. ATIS on radio said 30 C, and ATIS on the ground said 29 C. The flight plan was handed to me by ops personnel and checked weather on iPhone since coverage was available for Miami. Loaded FMS with flight plan and TPS [Takeoff Performance System] and checked. During taxi out we uploaded numbers and we were below weight and assumed temperature. TPS computed N1 of 84.5 which was a bit low but it was clear with 10,000 foot runway. As we did a rolling takeoff and hit TOGA noticed we didn't get the normal push with thrust but the airplane accelerated normally until about 120. That is when I thought this isn't right and checked again the takeoff weight which was 151,000 and realized this wasn't a normal power setting. I thought of either aborting or taking control and pushing power up manually but we were accelerating and rotated about with 2,000 FT remaining and took off. During the climbout after 10,000 FT I knew we were either well above planned weight or something else was wrong on TPS so I started looking. I looked at planned temperature which we thought said 28 C but we then noticed it was -28 C. I guess with all those earlier wrong temperatures showing up it was loaded into our TPS wrong as well. Thinking outside temperature was 29 C and we were below assumed 30 C we thought at the time it was correct. Obviously we will look at temperatures much closer in the future, and never assume anything. In hindsight either an abort or manually pushing power way up would have been the best options. At the time with length of runway and weather conditions we did neither.		Captain reviewed TPS numbers, [which] showed 22K standard takeoff assumed temperature 34 degrees C. ATIS showed temperature 29 degrees C. Began takeoff roll.  Aircraft seemed sluggish however [it] accelerated and [we were] able to takeoff with 2,000 FT of runway remaining. After cleanup discussed with the Captain the lack of acceleration of the aircraft. Reviewed the TPS and found closeout numbers used a minus 28 degrees C.		B737-800 flight crew experiences a sluggish takeoff from a 10,000 foot runway with an OAT of 29 C and a reduced thrust of an assumed temperature of 34 C. Once safely airborne it is found that the performance calculations were made using an actual OAT of -28 C. The crew believes this error caused the poor performance.

I was the PM. We complied with the QRH procedures and declared an emergency. I completed the checklist up until the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist and then transferred control, so that I could conduct the landing. In the rush I inadvertently calculated the landing weight incorrectly, which resulted in an overweight landing. I did not discover the error until after we landed and I talked to the Dispatcher. The actual landing weight was calculated by Dispatch as 128,300 pounds.I had calculated 125,300 pounds. Because of the proximity to the landing field, I only had time to notify Base Operation to relay to Dispatch of our situation and that we were returning to [departure airport.] Dispatch did not have time to contact us airborne to relay the landing data, which we had already calculated. The computation confusion came about as everything was very rushed while trying to complete the QRH procedures and prepare for landing in a very short amount of time. I discussed the issue with the Dispatcher and entered the overweight landing in the logbook. I also discussed the issue with Maintenance Control.		The engine overheated on climbout at about 200 feet to 300 feet. We referenced to the QRH and shut down the engine. We declared an emergency and returned to [departure airport.]		B737NG flight crew experienced a left engine overheat shortly after takeoff. They shut down the engine per QRH and declared an emergency.  A safe but modest overweight landing occurred due to an inadvertent miscalculation.

Specifically, the chart directs crossing EAGUL intersection at or above FL180 (based on QNE; that is, aircraft altimeters set to standard 29.92 in Hg.) The aircraft navigation database, in contrast, directs crossing EAGUL intersection at or above 18,000 FT (based on QNH; that is, aircraft altimeters set to a local altimeter setting.) Please note that the upper clearance limit of FL230 at EAGUL intersection is not at issue here. I queried the Air Traffic Controller as to which lower limit was correct at EAGUL intersection: FL180 or 18,000 FT. He replied that the lowest clearance limit to cross EAGUL intersection is FL180, not 18,000 FT (that is, the chart is correct and the aircraft navigation database is incorrect.) I asked him if he was certain of this and he replied that the lowest clearance limit to cross EAGUL intersection is FL180 and has always been so. I believe, but I am not certain, that this aircraft navigation database discrepancy is present in all A320 series aircraft. It is important that this discrepancy is promptly corrected because a sufficiently low local altimeter setting could result in a clearance deviation/violation/aircraft accident. For example, a local altimeter setting of 29.62 in Hg could cause an A320 series aircraft to cross EAGUL intersection at FL177 - which is 300 FT below the clearance limit altitude of FL180. The performance standards for Airline Transport Pilots delineate a maximum tolerance of 100 FT.	The reporter states that his company reported to him that this is just the way the A320 is and that keeping QNE until past the fix will prevent an altitude deviation.			A320 Captain reports his FMGC database depicts crossing EAGUL between FL230 and 18,000 FT, on the EAGUL 5 arrival to PHX. The chart, which is correct, indicates the lower limit should be FL180.

Flows, checklist, and SOP were followed while parked at the gate. These included and were not limited to: the route verification, departure procedure including the briefing pages.  I even went as far as placing a radius disk at the JFK 4 NM.  We discussed in length the Breezy Point climb on the JFK 1 departure.  When we were departing the ramp via V for Runway 31L, taxi instructions were A, hold short of H. I read it back and Captain repeated but instead of turning right, he heard turned left on A. I tried to catch it by stating that H was in the other direction but we were committed to the turn.  Within seconds, Ground corrected us and gave us new taxi instructions which included a turn which we missed and told us to contact clearance on a different radio for a re-route.  Ground gave us new taxi instructions which were join A, short of H.   Before switching frequencies I verbalized 'Short of H.'  The Captain responded 'Short of H, I got one' [radio].  I left Ground and contacted Clearance.  I was writing down the new clearance but was distracted because I was trying to keep tabs on the taxi route. I finally captured the new route and returned to Ground frequency as we were coming to H.  Ground asked how much longer because they were about to turn the airport around.  I stated 3 minutes, in which time I reprogrammed the FMS. Verified it with the Captain who had noted the new route was in the coded departures. He sent a message to Dispatch, while I took down the continuation of the taxi route to the Runway 31L.  New taxi instructions were cross 22R, right on Z and hold short of 31L.  I read it back.  We crossed 22R and Captain called for flight control check and Taxi checklist when ready.  We completed the Taxi checklist to the line when I switched to Tower.  Tower called and asked if we were ready.  Capt said 'yes' and below the line items on the taxi checklist.  I completed the flow, finished the checklist and gave it one quick look at the JFK 1 departure which states, 'Via vectors to assigned route/fix.  Expect cln to filed alt/fl 10 min after departure.' Wavey departure expect vectors to JFK R-156. I stated out loud what I read, while Tower cleared us for takeoff.  Then we were airborne, going straight into LGA airspace because we forgot all about the Breezy Point Climb.  NY Departure turned us to a heading of 180, then on a heading of 130. Informed us of our error.  We apologized.  NY Departure said no worries and handed us over to NY Center.  Contributing factor to this incident was the fact that the crew had been on a continuous duty period since [9 PM] EDT the night before.  Although we got our scheduled break of 6 hrs block to block.  We flew a fairly full aircraft to JFK.  After deboarding, van waiting, ride and signing in, an hour of our rest had been utilized.  Leaving us with no more than 3:20 at the hotel since we were scheduled for a 5 AM van.  I myself had only 90 min of sleep prior to this incident.  In my opinion, these continuous duty period schedules are dangerous.  It is almost impossible to adapt to the change in the sleep pattern.   In addition, distractions due to previous errors made on the taxi compounded by continuous taxi instructions and having to change frequencies to pick up new route clearances caused this incident.  Once the new route was in the FMS we realized it was going to be a longer flight and not wanting to delay the flight any further we rushed to complete the tasks at hand.  I was trying to do too much with too little.  Although, it seemed that everything got done and we did not short cut checklist.  By rushing we did forget our original Breeze Point Climb.  Eliminate continuous overnight schedules which do not allow for a full FAR crew rest.				A320 First Officer describes errors made during taxi out and takeoff from JFK after a continuous duty overnight, during which minimal rest was obtained.

Now, normally I try to hold well short of hold short lines in order to keep the stupid RAAS from shouting out Useless Communication Inhibitors (UCI's), but at this airport there is barely enough room to wedge a 737 between the two runways.  Sure enough, as we rolled to a stop at the XXR hold short, Tower tried to issue a clearance, likely my Company Somebody or Other About Something Fairly Important, but the RAAS blasted off and we couldn't hear a thing.  Upon asking for a repeat, we learned to our non-surprise that Tower had in fact tried to clear us for takeoff, but of course receiving and understanding that clearance is not as important as hearing the RAAS shout that we're approaching a runway that we're already stopping short of.  In all the years this safety hazard has been inflicted upon us I have yet to hear a single LINE pilot not say that it sucks.  And that's putting it politely.				A B737 Captain reports the EGPWS RAAS is a safety hazard because it interferes with important communications in untimely circumstances.

After takeoff, when handed over to Departure Control, we were told that we were not supposed to turn on the RNAV departure and instead we were supposed to hold a heading. We explained that we had not received that amended clearance via PDC NOR had the Tower told us about it. ATC's reply was 'It was on the ATIS.'  Although I have heard ATIS information say things like 'expect to fly the RNAV departure' or 'expect to fly runway heading,' I have never gotten an amended release to a PDC clearance via ATIS. Out of MIA, in fact, we are sometimes assigned a heading by the Tower before takeoff.  NOTE: I am new on the Airbus, and ATIS arrives to us via a piece of paper. I noted the ATIS we got after this event and it was Arrival ATIS. Apparently, this is always the case when requesting ATIS via the MCDU. The 'amended clearance' was on the DEPARTURE ATIS which, in hindsight, is something that we should have gotten over the radio.    1) There should never be an amended clearance delivered over the ATIS, especially if it is not reflected on the PDC. 2) We got arrival ATIS instead of departure ATIS.  For # 1: Tell ATC to stop that confusing procedure. PDCs should never be amended via ATIS.    For # 2: Emphasize that sometimes airports have different ATIS; one for arrival and one for departures...and put out a bulletin emphasizing the importance of getting the correct information for the next phase of flight.				A320 Captain reports departing MIA without a revision to their PDC issued via Departure ATIS.  ATIS requested via ACARS is Arrival ATIS and did not contain the revision.

I queried him about the altitude restrictions on the departure to which he responded 'all restrictions are cancelled'. We then deleted all the restrictions in the FMC including the 230 KT speed restriction. He then had a problem with our speed and said that his clearance did not delete the speed just the altitude restrictions. That isn't what he stated though. He then seemed to be very confused about both our speed and altitude and gave us 'stop your climb' and 'climb and maintain 230' at the same time. The Center Controller stated 'I apologize for their errors' to us when we check on. The Controller should have stated only that the altitude restrictions were cancelled when I tried to confirm his intent.		We were departing on the TWIN FALLS ONE (TWF1) departure out of SLC, which has all the typical altitude and speed restrictions commonly associated with RNAV departures. One peculiarity however, was our PDC stated 'maintain 10,000' and on a separate line stated 'maintain 230 KTS'. These PDC requirements matched the TWF1 up to SHOLZ Intersection, after which the FMC maintains 230 KTS all the way to MOFER which changes the speed restriction to 250 KTS. To ensure we complied with the PDC speed requirement, we put 230 KTS into the climb page, both below and above 10,000. Note I have flown a lot of RNAV departures and I have never encountered one that keeps the speed so low all the way to FL230. This added a level of complexity and non-standard flight deck procedures thus increasing workload. I was the pilot flying and when the aircraft passed SHOLZ at 10,000 FT MSL, we were given the following climb instructions: 'Flight#, climb to FL230. You are relieved of all restrictions.' The pilot not flying confirmed the radio call ensuring we were relieved of all restrictions and then proceeded to go heads down to delete the numerous coded constraints built into the TWF1. The aircraft accelerated to normal speed and began the climb to FL230. At approximately 17,000 FT MSL, the Controller said, 'Flight#, say your airspeed.' The pilot not flying replied, 'Flight#, 280 KTS'. The Controller then replied 'Flight#, you were given 230 KTS.' The pilot not flying replied, 'Flight#, you said we were relieved of all restrictions.' The Controller then proceeded to give us multiple heading changes, altitude assignments followed by amended altitude assignments, and a speed assignment of 250 KTS. The workload increased dramatically as both of us tried to keep up with all the requests. We were handed off to Salt Lake Center and upon check in, the new Controller said, 'Flight#, I apologize for all their errors.'The PDC created a level of confusion placing altitude and speed restrictions on top of a published RNAV departure. At a minimum, it is unnecessary or redundant; at best it added a layer of complexity that increased the error potential. The PDC simply needed to assign the TWF1 and a climb altitude such as FL 230. By stating 'maintain 10,000' and 'maintain 230 KTS' the PDC nullifies the TWF1 departure procedure after SHOLZ.The Controller's phrase 'You are relieved of all restrictions' was obviously not true. We even called back to verify we understood what was said. ATC needs to get this one solved and decide on a common, standardized phraseology that works in conjunction with RNAV departures so that pilots and controllers have a unified understanding of expectations. In retrospect, I wish we had been more specific and said: 'Flight#, understand we are relieved of the 230 KT speed restriction as well as the numerous coded altitude restrictions on the TWF1?' I will be more specific from now on. On the other hand, why assign RNAV procedures if you are not going to allow pilots to fly them as published. It seems like ATC tends to apply conventional aircraft handling procedures into RNAV procedures by amending speeds, headings, and altitudes. If ATC feels a need to maintain that level of control of aircraft in their sector, then perhaps we should return to conventional departures and arrivals instead of RNAV? I can only assume that controller training was in progress by the apology from the Salt Lake Center Controller. If not, then the series of altitude, heading and speed assignments we received was really out of the ordinary and it took a tremendous effort on both our parts to ensure compliance, however we were able to do what was requested.		B737-800 flight crew reports being cleared via the TWF1 departure from SLC with an added speed restriction of 230 KTS. Passing SHOLZ at 10,000 FT the crew is issued an unrestricted climb to FL230. Passing 17,000 FT the crew is admonished for exceeding 230 KTS.

We were cleared the ILS Runway 08 at 3,000 FT, configured flaps 5, and about to intercept the glideslope. I requested gear down at the same time ATC called traffic, canceled our approach clearance, and directed us to turn left heading 290. Due to the radio congestion, the pilot not flying did not hear my gear call. Immediately after the turn request from ATC, we received a TCAS Traffic Alert. As I was disconnecting the autopilot to comply with the turn, we received a 'descend, descend' RA. I immediately began the descent to comply. ATC then directed us to 'climb, climb' several times. I told the pilot not flying to tell him we were descending in response to the RA. Shortly thereafter, we received the clear of conflict notification from TCAS and ATC began vectors for set up for another approach. ATC apologized a couple of times and explained that GA traffic off Van Nuys had executed an incorrect missed approach. The next approach and subsequent landing were accomplished uneventfully. The traffic was never seen due to being in IMC; only the red square was visible on the map display.Due to the RA, we did not comply with the climb command from ATC. This event highlighted the importance of following the RA. The traffic at our 12 o'clock was also climbing and, had we followed the ATC climb in conflict with the RA, we would have been in a more hazardous clearance situation.I do not have a suggestion to prevent this from happening. Since the other aircraft was accomplishing the incorrect procedure, neither ATC nor we could have foreseen this conflict. The importance of following the RA was key to this event and the pilot not flying and I talked about it extensively upon landing. This event also highlighted the need to be ready for anything especially in a high workload phase of flight.		A C210 was on an IFR approach to VNY's 16R and went missed approach at 4,200. A B737 was landing straight in Runway 8 at BUR descending out of 4,000 FT to cross VNY at 3,000 FT. The aircraft were AT LEAST 6 miles apart at the time VNY called and advised of the missed approach. I displayed my 737 on their scope and advised them I would expedite them to 3,000 to fix the confliction. Somehow the C210 was allowed to descend to 3,000 FT (1,200 FT after coordination!) which put him in direct conflict with the 737. I canceled the 737's approach clearance and issued an expeditious climb, turn and traffic alert but it was too late, they responded to a TCAS RA. Not only was the C210 allowed to continue his descent the Tower also turned him directly west into the arriving B737! I am in awe of what just happened. The 737 crew did, however, thank me for my good service when I sent them on their way. VNY Tower needs to review this situation and learn from it. I am not one for calling anyone out or throwing anyone under the bus but that was absolutely terrible work from the Tower.		A B737-700 inbound to BUR suffered a close encounter with a C210 conducting an MAP from VNY.  The C210 had failed to follow the published MAP. Avoidance directives from ATC were in conflict with those from TCAS.

Several miles prior to YUGLU, which has [an at or below] 9,000 FT published restriction, ATC cleared us to climb to FL200. He did not use the 'climb via' verbiage. The clearance was [simply to] '...climb and maintain FL200.' The pilot flying removed the 9,000 FT restriction from the LEGS page.We were both, however, not sure if that's what ATC wanted so, after a few seconds waiting for the frequency to clear, I asked ATC if that clearance was unrestricted? He replied, 'Comply with all restrictions.' At this point, we were climbing through 9,000 FT and got to about 9,300 FT before leveling off at 9,000 FT. After discussing the situation with the PF, we both were under the impression that when ATC issues an amended altitude clearance on a SID and doesn't use the 'climb via' or other limiting verbiage that the SID's altitude restrictions are deleted.		There is confusion as to what ATC wants and what we should be doing with these RNAV departures. If ATC wanted us to comply with restrictions, why didn't they issue a 'climb via' clearance or simply state, 'Climb to FL200, comply with restrictions.' The Controller NEVER said anything like this. All he said was, 'Climb to FL200.' Unless I am wrong, that clearance relieves me of [intervening published] crossing restrictions. If we had not asked him if he wanted an unrestricted climb, we would have had an altitude deviation. We had, in fact, climbed to 9,300 FT so it might have happened anyway. One of us made a mistake, whether it is ATC or us is what I really want to know.		A B737-700 flight crew, cleared by a PDC to depart ABQ on the '...MNZNO departure, maintain 9,000 FT...' was re-cleared after takeoff to 'climb to FL200' by Departure Control. This clearance was given prior to YUGLO which is restricted to be crossed 'at or below 9,000 FT. Confusion ensued as the flight crew was uncertain whether departure's clearance relieved them from the restriction at YUGLO.

We took off, busy, but no problems. I got the LAS ATIS. Winds were 190/8 landing Runway 7R and 19L. We were planning on 25L. I vaguely remember 7R being a pain and a quick check of the box proved me to be correct. The only approach was not in our approach plates. So a visual approach over sloping terrain, again no problem. I asked Center what way they were landing as our arrival was designed to land Runway 25L. They did not know, Approach confirmed [Runway] 7R. Everything was fine until we contacted Tower. Winds 240/14G18, cleared to land [Runway] 7R. I asked the Controller to confirm the winds. The Controller repeated the same winds, with no concern at all despite all the aircraft that can or will not land with tailwind greater than 10 KTS. I looked at the winds 1,000 AGL we had an 18 KT tailwind. We executed a go around as did another flight behind us. With no approach loaded, there was no missed approach. So we got visual vectors to [Runway] 19L which were short. We were kept very busy trying to follow their directions. The final insult was being told to maintain 1,300 AGL to 3 DME for helicopter traffic. I told them we were unable and they made the helicopter hold for us. We landed taxied clear. After clearing Runway 19L, I was finally able to get a word in edgewise to Ground. We were given taxi instructions and despite having the taxi chart out we still turned on the wrong taxiway due to the unfamiliarity of the Captain and poor signage at our intersection. We stopped, I contacted Ground with our error and we were given further taxi instructions with instruction to contact ramp. We were in complete control and very conservative in our decision making. Suggestions, LAS Tower unwilling to switch the runways when it was obvious it was required. Tower was fine with us landing with winds out of limits. When we landed the windsock was parallel to the ground out of the west south west. LAS Tower with all the aircraft that land there knows the wind limits for a 737-700 NG as well as other. They should have been more proactive.				LAS Air Carrier arrival voiced a complaint regarding ATC's runway assignment noting the tail wind factor that caused a go around.

We were flying a 737NG aircraft and our gross takeoff weight was near MATOG. This takeoff was planned for bleeds off and flaps five. At around 110 KTS, we received a door warning indication and the Captain verbalized 'Continue.' A few seconds later, I heard loud screaming from the back around the 1L door. It also sounded like wind noise from the back of the aircraft. Just about that time, the Captain called 'Reject, I have the aircraft.' I confirmed that he had control of the aircraft and that the spoilers were deployed and reversers were being utilized. As we began to rollout, I notified the Tower that we were rejecting on the runway. As the aircraft came to a stop, I notified the cabin to 'Remain Seated'. The deceleration was much smoother than I expected with an RTO procedure. I was told that it was a very violent maneuver but was surprised to see how quickly and smoothly the aircraft came to a stop. Since we were so close to an exit for the runway, the Captain decided to roll the aircraft clear of the runway and I agree with this decision. The Captain called for the 'Rejected Takeoff Checklist.' After completing the checklist, the Captain called the back to confirm everyone was all right and that everyone was seated. The flight attendants stated that the door opened one foot during the takeoff roll. We made arrangements to return to the gate and had Maintenance standing by.				The flight crew of a B737NG conducted a high speed rejected takeoff when the 1L cabin door opened approximately one foot during the takeoff roll.

When I answered I received a very loud and frantic voice repeating this 'XXXX, XXXX, we must land immediately.' I tried to gain more information to no avail. I declared an emergency and asked for a return to the airport. When asked what the nature of the emergency was, I stated that is was unclear; however, it could be a fire type of situation. During the 180 degree turn back we received a second chime and got the same verbiage from the flight attendants. 'XXXX, XXXX, we must land immediately.' Soon thereafter I took the control of the airplane and radios and asked the First Officer to get more information from the back. We eventually found out that is was an ill passenger who was having a heart attack and CPR was being administered. I then stated to ATC what type of emergency we had and entered a downwind for the landing runway.The phrase 'XXXX' is mentioned one time in our operations manual. It is a Flight Attendant to Flight Attendant reference only. Simple English, with details, need to be used when describing a situation in the cabin of the airplane. Due to the severity of the ill passenger (heart attack, no pulse, no breathing and CPR being done) the flight attendants were under a lot of stress. They performed very well and I would like to acknowledge they probably saved this mans life! GREAT JOB! However, I feel there needs to be much more awareness of the fact that we are not privy to or trained in some of their references, acronyms etc. My perception of what was maybe a fire or other [question of airworthiness] type of situation, even though for a very short time, is very concerning due to the [lack of specificity] from the flight attendants.				Air carrier Captain reported a passenger had a heart attack shortly after takeoff, an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.  Captain stated the flight attendants were utilizing unique to the flight attendant group language to describe the situation which resulted in an inaccurate assessment of the needs between the flight crew and ATC.

As all pilots know, the River Visual is a very demanding approach during the best of circumstances. It is very labor intensive when done at night during periods of high traffic volume. The advertised approach in use at DCA was the LDA 19 with VASI being out of service. During the initial approach, Potomac asked if we would accept the charted River Visual approach (VASI back working) and we did. At approximately the 7 DME point we were in the end process of configuring the airplane for landing and the First Officer was accomplishing the Landing Checklist. The radio chatter was considerable and the Tower at some point advised us of helicopter traffic ahead and to the left (I believe he said 10 to 11 o'clock) and he was going to pass from left to right, below us and he 'HAS US IN SIGHT.' It has to be noted that these traffic calls and helicopters have unfortunately become background noise. There are always numerous military and government helicopters running up and down that river at all times of the day and night. Because of this, what would normally be alarming at any other airport in the country has become commonplace at DCA. The FAA allows these aircraft to operate in this environment and we have no choice, but to accept it and deal with it. Therefore, the helicopters being very close are not out of the norm. As you can imagine, I was concentrating on the approach and doing the required gyrations to stay over the river and not violate the White House prohibited airspace, and to keep the aircraft on the proper vertical profile. The Runway 19 visual was loaded in the FMGC and I was using it as a backup to my eyes. I was 'dead on' the donut and everything looked normal. I was at or very slightly above the recommended altitudes at each DME point. As I was approaching 4 DME, I caught a glimpse of the helicopter out of my left window and he did look higher than I expected to see him. I asked the First Officer to confirm if he was going to cross from north to south. He confirmed, however I directed him to ask the Tower and confirm it with them because it did not look right. The First Officer could not get a word in with the Tower. It was at that point, we got a TCAS 'TRAFFIC' call. Again, this is not out of the 'norm' for DCA. I was getting ready to take possible evasive action because it was getting uncomfortable; all this while trying to fly the demanding profile. Within seconds, we got a TCAS alert, 'MONITOR VERTICAL SPEED.' I complied with the TCAS alert and was thinking of going around but it all happened so very quickly that the point was moot. The helicopter passed 200 FT (MAX) below us. We were at 900 FT, slightly above the path. The Tower never called out the traffic beyond the first notification. The landing was uneventful. Due to the workload, we asked the Ground Controller for the Tower number and I called when I got to my vehicle. I called the Tower and spoke with the Controller in charge. At first it was it was obvious he was somewhat on the defensive and I had to press the point and ask very specific questions about the standard helicopter operations in the area. After some prodding, he admitted that it was a military helicopter flying from/to Ft. Meade and that he was at 700 FT and was 'a little higher than normal.' I asked what altitude was he supposed to be at and he replied, 'three to four hundred feet.' In addition, he did admit that the Tower version of collision avoidance did go to alarm but before they had a chance to react, the event was over. I cannot imagine what business is so pressing that these helicopters are allowed to cross the path of airliners carrying hundreds of people! I do not understand why they are not crossed IN-BETWEEN arrivals. They have at least 4 miles between these arriving aircraft and it seems that would be more prudent.				A320 Captain experiences an airborne conflict with a military helicopter at 900 FT during a River Visual to Runway 19 at DCA. TCAS RA states to monitor vertical speed with the helicopter 200 FT below the A320.

As we climbed out we tried varying the pitch and speed and recycling the landing lights. We found the vibration was speed sensitive. I contacted the A Flight Attendant who stated the forward galley was vibrating, but the most extensive vibration was overwing. We request of ATC to level at 310; we found we had to maintain a speed of .72 or less to keep the vibration under control. We had a current and qualified, A320 Captain, commuting in the cabin. I ask the A Flight Attendant to put him on the interphone. I had the pilot walk the cabin and evaluate the situation. After doing so he came into the flight deck and discussed the problem with us. He had found that the greatest vibration was from overwing to four rows in front of overwing. There was also vibration in the forward galley and flight deck. He felt the problem was either landing lights failed to the down position or an open panel of some type. The First Officer and I had already discussed that the vibration felt like extended lights. After our discussion with the other pilot we also suspected that the fueling bay door might have come open. We attempted to call Dispatch three times using the flight deck in-flight phone. We were the lucky winners of three dropped calls using the flight deck in-flight phone. We ended up talking to dispatch using Commercial Radio. We explained to Dispatch that due to our weight we would be close to an overweight landing if we returned to the departure airport. But we would only be able to maintain .72 if we continued to our destination. The decision was made to return. We got the aircraft turned around and then consulted the Flight Operations Manual as to if we needed to declare an emergency. We felt the situation did not meet the emergency criteria. We elected to go with precautionary landing. I called the A Flight Attendant and told her to prepare for a precautionary landing. I also briefed the passengers about our return to the departure airport. We used approved techniques, lower altitude, gear; speed brakes to increase fuel burn to get the aircraft below maximum landing weight. We landed without further incident. Upon arrival at the gate we had to wait several minutes for a ground crew to marshal us in. After shut down we were told that the aircraft was found to have the fueling bay door open. There was quite a bit of damage to that area of the aircraft. The door had started to separate from the aircraft. I believe the only reason it had not done so was because we had slowed our speed. Part of the door hinge was missing and the electronic wiring inside the fuel bay had been damaged. We deplaned the passengers and had a post incident brief with the flight attendants. I showed them the pictures of the aircraft damage. We change to a different aircraft and continued to the planned destination.				A320 flight crew returned to their departure for a precautionary landing due to an inflight vibration during departure climb.  Post landing aircraft inspection revealed the fueling bay door was open.

I was resting my arm on the flap lever, inputting information into the FMS. I felt the flap handle move aft, the aircraft 'raised up a bit,' and the flap position indicator moved from the up position toward the 1 degree mark on the gauge. I immediately moved the handle down into the detent position. I pulled back on the handle to ensure that it was completely in the correct position. This confirmed to me that the flap handle had not been properly seated after takeoff cleanup. We were at FL390, 0.79 mach and 240 KTS. This whole event lasted less than 3 seconds.1		In cruise flight at FL390, we received clearance direct to a fix on the XXX Arrival. I was making an address to the passengers at that same time. The First Officer as pilot flying entered the new fix in the CDU and as he pulled his left hand back his wrist or hand brushed the Flap Control Lever and it momentarily dropped back the Flaps 1 position. The aircraft bumped momentarily before the First Officer could return the lever to the Flaps Zero position. There was no aural overspeed indication and the Leading Edge Device (Amber) in Transit Light did not ever illuminate. We notified Dispatch via free text message of the occurrence and asked for them to advise Maintenance. We entered the occurrence in the logbook and radioed Aircraft Maintenance of the event upon arrival at the gate.		B737-800 First Officer inadvertently bumped the flap handle while entering data into the FMC during cruise, causing it to move out of the 'up' detent.

Suspect he did not change runway in his NAV database. We were told to maintain visual separation and cleared for takeoff on Runway 24L right after the other carrier was cleared for takeoff on 24R. After takeoff, he started to drift toward us and I started altering course slightly left to stay away from him.  About that time, we got the RA and complied. Either he didn't switch runway in his database or ATC gave an incorrect clearance to one or both of us. Departure seemed like they had no idea why we were both cleared for takeoff nearly in formation. I am curious myself as after both DLREY and FABRA the route takes both planes to ENNEY. We maintained visual separation until the RA but as we were basically cleared to takeoff on very close parallel runways at the same time we were very close to start with. We expected the other carrier or us would be given a turn away from each other after takeoff.				LAX air carrier departure described a developing conflict with parallel runway departure traffic after takeoff, the reporter suspecting the conflicting aircraft may not have changed database after a last minute runway change.

Fuel dump required on descent to land under max landing weight.		I was on first break when the crew call chime rang earlier then planned. I immediately called the cockpit and the Captain informed me we were heading back to the departure airport. I woke up the other Relief Pilot and then went up to cockpit. The Captain was coordinating with Dispatch and the flying First Officer was coordinating with ATC regarding fuel dump. We dumped fuel on the way back to the departure airport and the Captain made an uneventful landing.		A B777 right engine surged during climb at FL260 with fuel flow and EGT remaining above normal so fuel was dumped as the flight returned to the departure airport for an uneventful landing.

Runway 19R already NOTAMed closed so LAS was now on two runways. Fuel on board 6,600 [LBS] and arrival fuel with expected EFC 4.5. Attempted to contact Dispatch via ACARS. Unsuccessful and made very difficult by repeated interruptions. First Officer was pilot flying. Finally contacted Dispatch but still did not receive a diversion message. Were advised that Nellis and Laughlin were available if need be. Started searching offline airport kit for planning purposes and then switched to LAS Approach.Received new clearance direct FUZZY and descend via arrival but now for Runway 25R. Previous arrival brief was predicated on landing Runway 19L. Autopilot engaged in LNAV/VNAV modes so exit hold selected and turned inbound. As we had slowed to approximately 205 knots for holding, arrival indicated 250 knots at FUZZY. Queried Approach as to their speed requirements and were told 250 knots. Entered 250 in descent page, verified LNAV/VNAV and First Officer began reprogramming arrival for Runway 25R. As I was verifying the arrival route, I noticed the aircraft had descended to 15,400 feet even though we had not reached FUZZY. MCP mode and now Level Change. A very similar occurrence the very next day on a RNAV arrival with ATC change entered. Autopilot once again changed to Level Change. If this is normal, maybe something in training to point it out. Have had three RNAV incidents similar to this all.		As I was verifying the arrival route, I noticed the aircraft had descended to 15,400 feet even though we had not reached FUZZY. MCP mode and now Level Change. Advised ATC of error. Primarily, crews must ensure that aircraft flight performance is monitored at all times by at least one crew member. Both of us going 'heads down' to quickly prepare for the approach changes permitted the flight altitude deviation to go unrecognized for too long. Also, it would be helpful to understand why the SUNST ARRIVAL hard altitude at FUZZY, 16,000 feet, coincident with our holding altitude, suddenly changed to a soft altitude upon exiting the hold through the FMC. This was unexpected.		A B737NG autoflight system transitioned to LEVEL CHANGE (LVL CHG) and began a descent after the crew began programming the FMS's to exit holding and continue a RNAV arrival descent upon passing the holding fix at the holding altitude constraint.

Flaps were inadvertently moved to 10 when flaps were at 2 and Flaps 5 was called for. I cannot see gate settings from Captain's seat and must have moved the handle too far and into the gate for Flaps 10, when Flaps 5 was called for. Gatekeeper stated the event occurred at 4073 FT, on final for Runway 25L and outside of HUNDA intersection. We were behind a B767 and given 9 miles separation and cautions about possible wake turbulence, of which there was some. Winds were down the runway at 8-10 knots. This was day 6 out of 6 in a row of being on duty. Given the callouts and verification procedures we already have in place, it seems emphasis for Captain's as non-flying pilots to look around the throttles to verify the requested flap gate is actually selected, after verification, may help. Problem is, in the busy approach/speed and configure changes environment, it may not be possible to do that at all times.				B737-800 Captain reported mistakenly selecting flaps 10 when flaps 5 were called for, leading to an overspeed.

As aircraft was leveling from 11,000 FT to 10,000 FT, Captain airspeed indication dropped 50+ KTS. Throttles went to max, and nose pitched over. Captain disconnected throttles, we cross checked airspeed indications Captain/First Officer/PFD, and determined that First Officer airspeed was most accurate. Captain transferred control of aircraft to me. Captain declared emergency and asked for airfield equipment. I continued approach and landing with autothrottles and autopilot off using my airspeed, pitch/throttle position, and AOA indications. Captain's airspeed indication came back close to First Officer's indications. Throughout incident standby airspeed was much lower and unusable. Landing uneventful taxied to gate.				B737-800 First Officer reported airspeed, elevator feel differential, and EEC anomalies. First Officer airspeed was deemed most reliable and flight continued to destination after declaring an emergency.

While on the localizer, on board radar showed large weather cell immediately to the south of [the airport.] Visually, both the First Officer and I could see shafts of rain coming down just a few miles south of the airfield but there was no rain in our path to the runway and we had a clear view to the airport. Shortly after [inbound fix] Tower issued a microburst alert for our runway, indicating a 35 KT loss at 2 mile final. I was the pilot flying and I elected to continue the approach. We landed uneventfully. The approach was stable throughout. After further consideration of the event after the fact, my decision to continue the approach was contrary to [company] guidance. At the time of the alert, my First Officer recommended a go-around. Several factors influenced my decision to continue. I realize now that guidance is unequivocal in such a circumstance, and I offer these thoughts to describe how I came to my erroneous conclusion. First of all, the flight was an all-nighter. At the time the alert was issued, it was approximately XA:45 am body clock time. Certainly, fatigue was a factor which clouded my thought process.  Secondly, this is the first time in my 22 year career that I've encountered a microburst alert based on a TDWR or LLWAS-NE system. My initial thought at the time was that it was a report from a preceding aircraft, not these ground-based systems. Since we knew we were not following anyone on final, the thought that this was stale information crossed my mind. Also, we had a clear, unobstructed view of the landing runway, saw no rain in our path, and noted the weather was close but to the south of our path and the airport. I did consider the possibility of a dry microburst, but again considered the information might be stale and elected to proceed with caution, intending to go-around at the first sign of a loss of airspeed. Incidentally, we did brief an escape plan -- to the north -- at about 10-15 mile final as we approached the airport due to the weather visible to the south. Also, I erroneously understood the phrase microburst alert to be advisory rather than directive. Lastly, windshear and microburst training at [my airline] emphasizes cues from aircraft performance and on board warning systems. If the scenario we encountered was ever discussed in my training, I don't recall. But I will not forget this event and the lesson learned. I discussed the situation with my First Officer briefly after landing and at length on the flight home. In the lengthy discussion we agreed that my decision was incorrect and talked about the contributing factors mentioned above. In that further discussion, one human-factors-type consideration occurred to us related to the terminology of the ground based reporting systems described in [our operations manual]. Windshear/Microburst Guidance policies for operating with Windshear/Microburst Alerts and Advisories in effect. Refer to QRH Maneuvers Section for additional guidance. A.) Windshear Alert or Advisories. Takeoff and landing is permitted, however caution should be exercised. B.) Microburst Alert. Flights may not takeoff or conduct the final approach segment to a runway when ATC is reporting a runway specific microburst alert. If established on the final approach segment of an approach and ATC issues a microburst alert for the runway of intended landing, a go-around must be executed, and if necessary, accomplish wind-shear escape procedures. C.) Microburst Advisories. If the statement: 'Microburst Advisories in effect' is broadcast on the ATIS or issued by ATC, takeoff and landing is permitted, however caution should be exercised. Suggestions: Considering this was the first time either I or the First Officer had encountered such a microburst alert, I erroneously deemed the term 'alert' to be advisory, not directive. Of the three cases listed above, A and C allow continuation with caution and B does not. In the heat of battle, or the fog of fatigue, I'd suggest that the terms 'alert' and 'advisory' are too easily confused. I'd further suggest that 'microburst warning' would be a better term to identify the urgency, the directive nature and ground-based source of this actually and currently detected microburst information. Having grown up in tornado country, I know that a tornado warning means a tornado has been detected and is actually present. The same mental association to inform an aircrew of a detected microburst would avoid a mental A-word debate (Was that an Alert? Advisory? What's the difference again?). Elsewhere in our training, W-words are action words: WINDSHEAR, ground proximity WARNING. A warning always identifies a present threat. An alert may be advisory or directive. Understanding that such a change in terminology would require FAA involvement, a more immediate means of addressing a potentially wide-spread confusion/problem would be to incorporate such ground- based microburst alerts in recurrent training, emphasizing that in this case the alert is directive. This is one of those things that you don't do twice, but it would be prudent to ensure that all crews on all fleets have their 'once' experience in a training environment rather than an operational one.		Windshear [and] microburst simulator training should include a scenario where ATC voices various windshear or microburst Advisories or Alerts in order for crews to differentiate what appropriate actions to undertake. We train satisfactorily in the simulator to employ procedures when a windshear event is physically or aurally detected in progress but can easily, in real world operations, be lured into a false sense of security when ATC issues alerts and the meteorological environment continues to remain very stable. In the future if ATC issues a Microburst 'Alert' I will emphasize a mandatory go-around is executed.		B737-800 flight crew reported they received a microburst alert from Tower on final approach and the Captain elected to continue the approach contrary to company guidelines and First Officer recommendation.

Entered clouds as we leveled at 10,000 FT. Within a few seconds the CA PFD IAS suddenly decreased from 250 KTS to less than 200 KTS. I turned the autothrottles OFF, set power, adjusted pitch attitude and checked the FO's PFD IAS. Since the First Officer's PFD indicated 250 KTS I transferred the flight controls to him with the autopilot OFF. I was then the PM and advised Approach we had an emergency and requested ARFF. Approach Control gave us priority to Runway 16 ILS. As we descended below the 5,000 FT ceiling the Captain's IAS appeared to return to normal. The FO completed the approach and landed uneventfully with 30 flaps and autobrakes 2. The emergency vehicles followed us to the gate. I spoke with the Fire Chief and Dispatch. There were no braking issues (no overheat). So we completed the Parking Checklist and the Maintenance logbook and handed the airplane over to Maintenance after everyone deplaned.Prior to this event, before top of descent, we had an 'IAS DISAGREE' light illuminate in both the Captain PFD and First Officer PFD. This light was intermittent and would appear with a 5 KT difference and extinguish with a difference of 4 KTS or less. So we were cross-checking IAS frequently which helped us to quickly react to the sudden loss of Captain's IAS. After we completed the parking checklist, I went outside the airplane and checked the pitot tubes and static ports. They all appeared clear and normal.				A B737-800 Captain's Airspeed dropped to about 200 KTS as the aircraft entered clouds at about 10,000 FT but the First Officer's airspeed remained normal at 250 KTS. Descending through about 5,000 FT, the airspeed was again normal.

[Narraitve 2 contained no additional information.]		A B737-800 IAS and MASTER CAUTION alerted near rotation speed on takeoff because of a 20 KT to 50 KT left to right airspeed indicator difference so an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

The sign could cause a severe distraction during a low visibility approach, especially at night.  The sign needs to be relocated so as not to shine in the pilots' eyes while on final approach below 100 FT.	The Reporter stated that while they were on short final to PHX Runway 7R a large TV style sign changed content and was bright enough to be a distraction. In a low visibility situation it would obscure approach lights below 100-150 FT. The sign should be dimmed or removed so as not to interfer with flight crew ability clearly to see the runway at low altitude.			A pilot approaching PHX Runway 7R commented on a bright TV style commercial billboard whose content changed during a dusk VMC approach, interfered with visual ability and was a distraction because it was brighter than the approach lights.

The Captain elected to attempt to reset the yaw damper, but his attempts were unsuccessful. After being distracted by the yaw damper malfunction, we continued to configure for the approach. However, we were unable to stabilize the aircraft by 1,000 AGL as required by company policy, therefore, I called for a go-around. The Captain concurred, and we executed a missed approach.During the approach, I had noticed abnormal indications on the MASI. Specifically, the low speed red checkerboard and low speed yellow tape indications were displaying at much higher airspeeds than normal. I mentioned this to the Captain, but he disregarded it and immediately began to prepare for another approach. On the second approach, the same abnormally high MASI indications occurred. Since we were not able to achieve a stabilized approach, I called for another go-around. The Captain again concurred and we executed a second missed approach. I suggested that we get delaying vectors in order to run the Yaw Damper Failure Abnormal Checklist since I suspected that abnormal MASI indications may in some way be related to the failure of the yaw damper. The Captain concurred and we ran the Yaw Dampener Failure Abnormal Checklist. Because this did not correct the abnormally high low speed indications on the MASI, we contacted Company Maintenance via the radio in an attempt to gain help in sorting out the problem. Maintenance was unable to offer advice. However, moments later, I noticed that the flaps had failed to retract fully. This led me to make the correct diagnosis of a flap failure. We completed the no-Flaps Abnormal Checklist and diverted.I should have been more assertive by insisting that we get delaying vectors in order to diagnose the abnormally high low speed indications on the MASI after the first missed approach. I unwisely let the Captain rush me into immediately beginning to prepare for a second approach rather than insisting that we get delaying vectors to slowly and methodically diagnose the problem. I believe that we both initially (and hastily) dismissed the abnormal indications as a temporary software glitch. The abnormal MASI indications also distracted our attention from the flap position indicator.	The reporter advised they ultimately determined the flap position indicator showed the flaps were extended somewhere between zero and one. He felt confident they had been at that setting throughout the event. He emphasized the crew's failure to specifically check the flap indication was in part the result of their preoccupation with the yaw damper failure for which they hadn't initially conducted the appropriate checklist and the abnormal MASI indications for which they were trying to somehow logically relate to the failed yaw damper.When asked about flap fail/asymmetry warning lights/aural warnings he stated that there are none on the 737 models in their fleets. He was, in fact, aware that at least one company flight crew had flown an entire approach with the flaps at zero with the flap handle in an 'appropriate' landing setting and that the lack of any unique warning for such a failure he believes it is likely to happen again (and, he noted, probably had).When asked about deviations from normal control input effects from flap extension/retraction cycles he advised he was not the pilot flying and could not remember whether the captain was hand flying or on autopilot. On that subject he believes that the 737 models with which he is familiar exhibit less attitude change or positive/negative seat of the pants G forces than other types when flaps are extended or retracted. He did not recall any evident and/or significantly different such changes during the episode.Upon arrival at their diversion airport the flaps were extended using the alternate, electrical system.			When their yaw damper failed on approach the flight crew of a B737-700 was distracted and, unable to establish a stabilized approach to the short runway at their destination, performed a missed approach. A second approach suffered the same inability to stabilize at which time the First Officer noted abnormally high 'low speed' stall indications on the MASI [Mach Air Speed Indicator] and realized the flaps had not extended as commanded. They diverted successfully to an airport with longer runways.

Per the MEL, we operated the right pack utilizing the right engine bleed and the left pack with bleed air from the APU up to 17,000 feet.  At 17,000 feet, we turned off the APU bleed and right pack thereby operating the left pack using the right engine bleed.  We climbed to our cruising altitude of 22,000 feet and leveled off.  We notice the cabin was climbing and the duct pressure was registering approximately 10 PSI.  I requested an immediate descent from Center because of a pressurization issue.  They initially cleared us to 16,000 feet.  We began the descent and I told them we needed to descend down to 10,000 feet.  They cleared us to ten.  At approximately 20,000 feet, the Altitude Warning Horn sounded.  We accomplished the Immediate Action Items, donned our oxygen masks, and established communications.  I accomplished the Altitude Warning Horn/Abnormal Pressurization and Emergency Descent Checklists while the First Officer continued the descent.  Passing approximately 15,000 feet, the Pass Oxy On light illuminated and the oxygen masks dropped in the passenger compartment.  Per the Emergency Descent QRH procedures, I made a PA informing the Passengers of the descent and the deployment of the oxygen masks.  I told them to use the masks as instructed, but emphasized the situation was under control and we would have the cabin at an altitude where the masks were not required momentarily. After the checklists were completed and approaching 10,000 feet, I realized the APU was still available for pressurization.  I reconfigured the air conditioning panel as instructed in MEL 36-5-01 for operations below 17,000 feet.  I elected not to declare an emergency. We had already been cleared to descend to 10,000 feet before the Altitude Warning Horn sounded.  Reaching 10,000 feet, the situation was stabilized.  I requested a return from ATC.  They cleared us on the arrival.  We then referenced the items for diversion on the Normal Checklist card.  We informed Dispatch of the depressurization, mask deployment, and return.  We coordinated with Operations for a gate and Customer Service requirements.  I made several more PAs advising the passengers of our return assuring them that the situation was under control, oxygen masks were no longer required, and the odor caused by the oxygen generators was perfectly normal.  The return was uneventful.  The flight attendants did an excellent job of taking care of the passengers and maintaining calm in the cabin in a very stressful situation.  I said goodbye to the passengers as they exited the aircraft and they were all very complimentary of the calm professionalism of the flight attendants.  I used the IPad EFB during this incident and it was extremely easy to set up the return and have access the appropriate charts.   As an airline, we seem much more willing to MEL items than we were in the past.  The altitude restriction incorporated in the MEL made this a manageable depressurization event.  Dispatch explained there was no airplane available to put on this flight yet, when we returned, there was an airplane at the next gate within approximately 30 minutes.  The MEL is a valuable tool, but it must always be considered preferable to fix airplanes than to MEL them and send them on their way.		Flight dispatched with Engine Bleed closed. MEL called for using APU Air until 17,000 feet then operating opposite pack with isol open. We failed to notice the problem until after reconfiguring the air panel (15,000 feet to 17,000 feet). Level at FL 220, we saw that the cabin was going to climb through 10,000 feet. We got clearance to 10,000 feet and began a descent and, soon after, got the Cabin Altitude Warning, donned masks, established communications, ran QRH, and requested to return. The Captain handled the ATC communications and communication with the crew while I continued to fly the plane. The passenger O2 masks deployed as advertised as the cabin caught up with altitude. Returning to the departure airport, we discovered Maintenance had performed MEL procedures on the wrong (good) engine. There were some clues that could have prevented the issue at several points along the way. Paying more attention to where Maintenance was (we both had commented at the fact that Maintenance had not been out, raised the cowling, etc.) and leveling off when first recognizing something wasn't quite right.		B737-700 flight crew reports loss of cabin pressurization at FL220 after being dispatched with the left engine bleed inoperative and the APU powering the left pack to 17,000 feet.  When the APU bleed air is turned off the problems begin.  Crew returns to the departure airport and discovers that Maintenance performed the MEL procedure on the wrong engine.

Received Number 1 Bleed Trip Off light approximately 100 NM west of where we had taking off from. Executed QRH procedures (light did not extinguish with trip reset button). We were now single pack operation. Continued to our filed destination with single pack. Pressurization OK. I was thinking about the single pack status and not feeling too comfortable with the fact I was one malfunction away from a possible emergency descent. Also, there would be some icing conditions possibly encountered enroute and I knew we were to 'avoid' icing conditions in that configuration. After about 10 minutes, I wondered if the Number1 Bleed Air would reset so we pressed the trip reset button. The light extinguished and we were two bleed source operation again and then brought the left pack on line again. Now, we had full capability if encountering icing. After another 10 minutes, the Number1 Bleed tripped off again. This time, QRH was used and we did not attempt any further resets. We arrived at our destination single pack with no icing encountered enroute. When we arrived, I explained to Maintenance what had transpired including the attempt to get the Number 1 bleed back on line. He seemed to appreciate that this was a verified more than one time event, asked I write all that in the logbook, which I did, and the aircraft was taken out of service. I wanted to do the right thing by telling Maintenance all my in-flight steps and, in doing so, realized I might be 'putting myself on report' by doing more than the QRH specifically authorized, hence this ASAP report. The QRH could be better amplified to tell us that we should not attempt a second reset of the system after waiting 10 minutes or so if it doesn't want us to do it. It is just too tempting given the situation we are put in with just single pack, long cruising requirements. I don't feel it is specifically (enough) prohibited, but better refinement could be warranted if in fact we should not be doing any extra resetting attempts.		[This Report contains no additional information]		A B737-700 Left Bleed tripped at FL400, but did not reset following the QRH. Ten minutes later a successful reset was accomplished but the bleed tripped again, so the flight continued single pack.

The APU was still providing electrical power to the aircraft. The main generators automatically engaged as advertised in the event of this situation. During the power disruption, the B autopilot disengaged. We had no loss to any other system on the aircraft, or displays, other than the autopilot kicking off. The Captain immediately reached over to re-engage the A autopilot and then the B autopilot and neither would engage. We then requested from ATC to level off at FL330 in order to maintain aircraft control and analyze our situation. Since the A and B autopilots worked normally on APU electrical power, the Captain made the decision to start the APU above FL250 in order to attempt to regain the autopilot system. The APU started with no problem and the Captain immediately placed the aircraft power on the APU and successfully re-engaged the B autopilot system. We then began to discuss what had just happened. We again determined that we had not lost any electrical system on the aircraft and were questioning why the A and B autopilots would not engage on normal Gen 1 and Gen 2 power. The Captain elected to leave the APU running in order to maintain maximum system reliability, for the autopilot, while operating in RVSM airspace. With the B autopilot successfully engaged, we elected to stay at FL330 and began analyzing and researching our situation by looking at the QRH Electrical System section and determined that we had no electrical system failure. We checked the circuit breaker panels and discovered no popped circuit breakers. We then began discussing RVSM operations and requirements in the event of the autopilot system falling offline. We referred to the Flight Operations Manual and the MEL section of the Electronic Flight Bag for additional information, guidance, restrictions and ATC requirements. During this review process, one of the flight attendants called and asked the Captain for a WI-FI reset (which I was not aware of). Shortly after, we received an ACARS message for a WI-FI reset followed by the 'B' Flight Attendant asking why the aft galley coffee pot was not working anymore. We immediately realized that load shedding was occurring. The Captain checked the electrical panel for aircraft power distribution and realized that we were on sole source power (the APU). Realizing our error, the Captain immediately and successfully placed the Number One GEN BUS followed by the Number Two GEN BUS online. The B autopilot momentarily disengaged during the power transfer and was immediately re-engaged. Realizing that everything was back to normal, the APU was shut down. The remainder of the flight was uneventful.So what was the sequence of events that put us into this unintentional situation? How did we both miss key items on normal flows and checklist? Our day began as day one of a three-day PM pairing. This was the first time either one of us had met or flown together. The preflight briefing and crew expectations were normal and uneventful. Our day was scheduled for two legs. Our first flight required us to return to the gate just prior to taxiing due to a passenger's dog that was barking and yelping. After the passenger, dog, and bags were removed from the aircraft we conducted a normal two-engine start, taxi, and takeoff. We landed approximately 30 minutes behind scheduled arrival time. While on the ground, we had a scheduled flight attendant crew change and requested engine oil servicing, which began to delay our turn by an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Looking back and not really realizing where we were operating with respect to the Risk and Resource Management icon, we were moving into the yellow due to the crew change waiting for Maintenance and operating in the congested alleyway between the X and X concourses.With more than 55 years of total flying experience between thetwo of us (military and civilian), we missed several checklist opportunities to correctly identify and correct improper settings for the APU and electrical panel configuration. We failed to recognize those times when the Risk and Resource Management (RRM) icon had us squarely in the yellow and at times on the border of yellow and red. Why did it happen? It certainly was not from complacency; part of the breakdown was caused by external and internal distractions along with environmental lighting conditions effect on the cockpit during the transition from sunset to night time operations during normal flow and checklist procedures. Other factors were temporary breakdowns in CRM communication by reacting too quickly before verbalizing and verifying prior to turning off the APU immediately at FL320 and by not waiting for a moment before attempting to re-engaging the A and B autopilot system after the main generators were automatically placed on line (thank you manufacturer's engineers). We also unintentionally experienced tunnel vision and partial loss of situational awareness as a crew while at FL330 during our analysis of RVSM airspace rules and options in the event that we would lose the A and B autopilot again and while analyzing why the A and B autopilot would not engage during the first attempt on the main generators. We started going down different paths and narrowed our scope while all along failing to recognize all we needed to do was place both main generators on line and attempt to re-engage the autopilots again. The rest of the pairing was back to basics and a clear understanding of applying good CRM and RRM awareness during every phase of preflight, ground, and flight operations. Realize that there are many distractions with ATC radio calls during the takeoff and climb out phases of flight. Don't pay lip service to what you expect to see; pause to really look or actually point at the switch positions. We also re-emphasized Challenge-Response-Response procedures for the checklists with special emphasis on electrical panel settings, fuel panel settings and changes, start switches, engine and wing anti-ice switches, APU operation, FMC changes, MCP, etc. Also, one of the basic lessons re-learned while maintaining aircraft control, analyzing the problem, keeping situational awareness, and coming up with a game plan, was to not be in a hurry, take the time to slow down wind the clock and take a look at the big picture in front of you. This will help you maintain situational awareness and prevent you from going down rabbit holes and getting tunnel vision.As professional pilots we are all aware of the fact that many of our procedures were derived from unintentional actions resulting in undesired consequences. I know that many people at company headquarters have put in numerous hours in developing checklist and procedures to keep the pilots of this company up to the safety and professional standards the FAA and company requires and our Customers expect.Suggested Changes: Before Taxi Checklist: Change from 'Generators Gen On/Off' Logic: Ensures verification of power source distribution for both single-engine taxi and dual engine taxi.Before Takeoff Checklist: Change from 'Number 1 Gen On/Off Number 2 Gen On/Off' Logic: Ensures verification of generator power configuration on both engines prior to take off or on one engine generator and the APU on the other side in the event of an MEL requiring that configuration.		To prevent this event from occurring again, for me as a Captain, since the first officers have been starting the engines and putting the generators online and turning the APU off, I can see that I need to create a new habit pattern. This event made it obvious to me that I consciously need to create new cues for myself with this new checklist procedure. Beginning with my next trip, I will see if I can incorporate rechecking the generators online/APU off along with the throttle advance/takeoff warning horn check.Regarding the Volant model, even though we had had several distractions and interruptions, I did not recognize that I was in the Yellow and now I can see that very clearly and will be hugely more cognizant of that in the future. I realize that checklists are 'protected airspace' and many brilliant minds have probably already been through this. My question is: Would it be better to 'anchor' attention (as we do with the flap handle when we call for the flap setting) by saying more specifically, 'Generator 1--ON; Generator 2--ON; APU--Off' versus our current 'Generators--On' cover-all response? This would also make it normal and natural whenever we were flying with an MEL of one generator inoperative and using the APU to power that bus (although that is very rare at our company with our great Maintenance). For myself, when this situation occurred, I could have been more patient in reference to getting the autopilot ON after I had self-induced the power interruption when I had turned the APU off. Thanks to our PC/PT study guides, I had remembered that this aircraft would automatically connect the generators in this circumstance; still, it was a complete shock, especially when your mind is convinced that you had already performed certain tasks earlier in the flight.		A B737-700 APU was discovered powering the aircraft at cruise, so it was turned OFF which put both engine generators online tripping the autopilot. The APU was restarted for autopilot power, but when the aircraft began load shedding both engine generators were restored for normal electrical operation.

We leveled off around 14,000 FT and oscillation stopped. We continued climb and as soon as climb power was introduced oscillation started again. This time we leveled off at FL240 and after discussion I declared an emergency and returned to the departure airport for an overweight landing.	The reporter stated that the oscillation frequency with climb power applied was about 3 'bumps' per second. In level flight at 14,000 FT the 'flutter' was absent. During climb to 24,000 FT the 'flutter' was evident again but after leveling and with the power reduction, the anomaly ceased. The 'flutter' was felt throughout the aircraft and the reporter decided it was serious enough that he returned to the departure airport. He had not heard the cause of the event, but was told that this was a repeat event with this aircraft.			A B737-800 developed an elevator flutter with a frequency of about 3 oscillations per second with climb power applied, an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

Also had multiple ECAM warning/advisories including ELECT: DC EMERG CONFIG. Followed ECAM through many pages, leading to deployment of the RAT. The RAT cleared most of the ECAM's and re-powered the ess DC bus, so we were out of the emergency elect configuration. Had some ECAM warning/advisories left, including BCL1/2 fail; Engine 1 A-C FADEC supply; APU no battery start; APU no fire detect; Number 1 RSVR inoperative; Number 1 Engine no start. Elect Page showed DC battery bus unpowered. After ECAM complete and malfunctions stabilized, we contacted Maintenance Control thru a patch. All agreed with crew assessment that we were no longer in an emergency situation. All agreed with crew decision to continue to destination. Following discussion with Maintenance Control, we called a deadheading A320 pilot up to the cockpit to put fresh eyes on the problem. He also concurred with crew actions and decisions so we proceeded to destination. During approach brief, all ramifications of the thrust reverser inoperative and possible radio problems were discussed. We used the longest runway, and before the RAT died, briefed Tower/Ground that we might have radio problems and received clearance to our gate. Approach and touchdown went normally, but after touchdown things got complicated and weird. I believe we had additional electrical problems that were not apparent to us, specifically with LGCIU's and/or ground proximity switches such that the aircraft thought it was still in the air. After touchdown and engines to idle, it appeared to go to flight idle (600-700pph), the ground spoilers did not deploy; after the RAT died, we lost comms, and the airplane went through multiple rapid BIT checks, including fire/detect cycles including lights and alarms, etc, etc. It is my belief that the only braking we had was accumulator pressure. I say this because at the gate with the parking brake set, we had zero normal brake pressure and the accumulator was near zero too--indicating that was what we were using for braking. At the gate, the engines would not shut down normally. With master switches to off, the FF would go to zero, then back to idle as the engines went into an auto-start. Engines had to be shut down with the fire buttons. The airplane thought it was still flying, and it was not something we expected. There were no FAA violations, and all is well that ends well. But something very unusual happened to this airplane.		Master caution and multiple ECAMs came on and autopilot disengaged. Captain flew and First Officer did ECAMS. Failure drove to deploy RAT, after RAT deployed most ECAMS disappeared. Both engine AC generators working but essential busses powered by RAT. Electrical page showed Amber Bat Bus. Engine Reverser 1 inoperative, Eng 1 start inoperative, APU no bat start, no APU fire detected and min RAT speed 140 on status page. Autopilot was working and engaged. The Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control who brought a Duty Manager into the loop. All agreed to continue to our destination. [We] landed [on the runway] using selected speed 140. Contacted ground and told them we had elec issues. Taxiing to gate lost radios, ACP and RMP's blinking. At gate had to use QRH: Engine fails to shut down checklist on both engines (fire light switches to shut down).	The First Officer states that the first thing that the maintenance technician did upon entering the cockpit was to cycle the battery switches off then on then proceed to start the APU.  The ECAM BCL faults disappeared and the APU started normally.  During approach it was noted on the electrical page that all buses were powered except the battery bus which was amber.  Although this maintenance action seemed to clear the faults entirely, it was discovered in maintenance history that ultimately maintenance elected to replace both BCL relays and both batteries.	A320 flight crew experiences an ECAM alert for BCL1, immediately followed by BCL2, losing essential DC power while in cruise. Many pages of ECAM's are complied with until finally the RAT is deployed, which cleared most of the ECAM's and repowered the ess DC bus. Flight continues to destination but after touchdown the ground spoilers would not deploy, after the RAT died, communications were lost, and the airplane went through multiple rapid BIT checks, including fire/detect cycles including lights and alarms. The engines would not shut down normally at the gate and the fire buttons had to be used.

[We were] cleared direct FOOTT Intersection after we were cleared to descend via the HAWKZ 2 landing north. We were approximately 2,200 FT above profile due to the direct route. Center then requested a speed increase to 300 KTS, followed later by a reduction to 250 KTS, frequency change to approach and we were requested to fly 210 KTS. We managed to get back on profile but I think that the airspeed change requests from Center and approach when we are below 18,000 FT require excessive heads down time and have the high potential for deviations. Normal landing followed.Called Approach when we got on the ground to find out why the large airspeed changes contrary to the published speeds on the arrival and I talked with the supervisor on duty and he said it was due to sequencing with arrivals from the south but also the Local Controller's issues with fitting us in with arrivals from other arrivals from other directions.				A B737-800 Captain, cleared ro descend via the HAWKZ RNAV STAR to SEA, reported excessive ATC intervention with route shortening direct routes and large scale variations in assigned airspeeds.

We complied with the ECAM and turned off the Blue Electric Hydraulic Pump. At this point, we ran the checklist per SOP for a Non-normal Laning and completed the landing distance procedure. We called Dispatch and Maintenance for a conference. While talking with Maintenance, we received a HYD B RSVR LO LVL. The only difference from the previous ECAM was not to turn the Blue Electric Pump on during approach. Otherwise, all protocol remained the same. Maintenance entered the failure into the maintenance history and informed arrival station Maintenance. We discussed the issue with the flight attendants. We declared an emergency with ATC and asked for 34L and direct our destination VOR. Once we checked on with ATC, they assured us that airport authorities had been notified and emergency equipment was ready. We continued and landed on 16R without further incident.		[No additional information from Narrative #2]		An A320 ECAM alerted HYD B SYS LO PR followed shortly thereafter by HYD B RSVR LO LVL so an emergency was declared, the QRH completed and an uneventful landing followed at the destination airport.

My concern is how often these masks are checked out of the aircraft container by Maintenance. I believe these masks should be fully checked (out of the container) each day.				When the First Officer left the cockpit for a break a B-737NG Captain donned his O2 mask and discovered a leak in the self inflating harness.

The First Officer was flying and the Captain was monitoring. We had been cruising at FL410 for approximately 20-30 minutes in light chop and aware of isolated storms enroute. The radar was being used in both manual and auto mode to attempt to 'paint' any potential weather enroute. Our optimum altitude in the FMC was FL410 and we had just entered what appeared to be wispy high clouds. While cruising at .79 mach in light chop (in the proverbial milk carton) the airspeed began to increase notably (much like mountain wave), and it became necessary for the First Officer to manually retard the thrust levers to approximately a 'stand up' position on the quadrant. Within a few seconds the 'increase shear' quickly became a 'decreasing shear' and the (yellow) footer quickly came into view followed very rapidly by the (red hashed) stick shaker. Full thrust (to the stops) was instantly applied, despite the autothrottles trying to reduce thrust. The aircraft, though in the stick shaker was NOT stalled as no uncommanded movements of the aircraft were encountered, no altitude loss was noted and the wings were always level and responding to input. The Captain asked ATC for lower (FL390) and simultaneously pressed level change to FL390 as ATC cleared us and asked if we needed any assistance. The aircraft pitch commands did not display a descent out of FL410, hence the First Officer disengaged the autopilot and began the descent (the autothrottles) continued to resist increasing thrust by the First Officer as the aircraft continued to experience periodic stick shaker indications. The Captain disengaged the autothrottles and increased thrust. Shortly after we began our descent to FL390 the aircraft airspeed began to return towards normal. No exceedances were noted, however, to be certain, upon landing the Captain called for Maintenance to check for engine exceedance...none was discovered on the instruments or in the FMC by the Technician.				B737-700 Captain reports encountering up and downdrafts at FL410 requiring full thrust to maintain flying speed, followed by a descent to FL390.

Referenced QRH procedure for 'ENGINE LOW OIL QUANTITY' which directs to monitor engine instruments. All other engine parameters were normal with oil pressure reading 43 PSI and oil temperature reading 103 degrees, which closely matched indications on Number 2 engine. Reviewed appropriate QRH procedures for low oil pressure and high oil temp and began discussion with First Officer as to what would be required if engine parameters degraded. Approximately 5 minutes after the initial low oil quantity reading the oil pressure began to decrease rapidly toward 3 psi. Performed QRH procedure for 'ENGINE LOW OIL PRESSURE' which directed Number 1 engine shutdown. First Officer remained pilot flying and took over radio responsibility and I performed checklist duties. Declared emergency and immediately requested descent to FL240 and return. Cleared direct and descent to 12,000 FT. Continued to review options with First Officer for other airport destinations and determined ZZZZ to be nearest suitable due to time, weather, services. First Officer continued flying aircraft and I began coordination with flight attendants and performed PA to passengers. Flight Attendant 4 was a speaker and relayed the PA in Spanish as we had a majority of passengers that did not speak English. We were then cleared for the arrival and ILS approach and we set the appropriate altitude in the MCP altitude selector. After resetting FMC cruise altitude, First Officer intercepted path at approximately 18,000 FT and began arrival and approach. Conditions were VMC and we had visual contact with the field at this time. I then notified Dispatch via ACARS and asked him to review our decision and other possible options. We concluded to proceed as planned. First Officer and I then began QRH 'ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE' and 'EMERGENCY LANDING' checklists, review of QRH supplemental information, QRH Deferred items, approach and single engine procedures, and expected aircraft performance issues. First Officer was doing a superb job flying aircraft and as time was permitting I continued to review aircraft performance data and options for a plan B if the situation required a go around. I elected to exercise Captains Authority, 14 CFR 121.557, and have the First Officer continue the approach and landing. Flaps 15 landing [were] performed with max brakes. Aircraft touchdown at approximately 1,500 FT from threshold and stopped approximately 6,500 FT from threshold. Taxied to hard stand and deplaned passengers via air stairs.		[Report contained no additional information].		B737-800 flight crew experiences loss of engine oil quantity shortly after level off at FL290, followed by loss of oil pressure. The engine is shut down and the flight returns to the departure airport for landing.

There is no way to achieve a seal not even with positive pressure.  I don't know if they are made like this or getting stretched out when guys use them, but it is obvious that in a fire I would be dead.  I am not particularly small, although I am a trim female.  These are obviously made only for big boys making it appear the rest of us are expendable.

We came through the bases of the clouds and it became obvious through multiple lightning strikes, the clouds we were in were very convective which we did not previously know. There were multiple lightning strikes around us and the airspeed began to stagnate. I announced the stagnation and decrease in airspeed to the Captain and he responded that he was seeing it to. This was still before the FAF between 3,000 and 2,000 FT. I was busy switching from Approach to Tower at this time and [making] commanded configuration changes and running the Landing Checklist but the stagnation continued. I was waiting for the autothrust to give him additional power and it never came. Researching it later, below 3,200 radio altitude the autothrust should be more sensitive and should never accept the speeds that the aircraft was slowing too, well below the magenta bug. This makes me think there is a problem with the autothrust on approach with this aircraft. I then noticed he was taking an action, not necessarily what I would have done. He took the thrust and placed it in MCT or slightly between CLB and MCT and moved it around a little seeming to be trying to get the thrust up. After seeing multiple mode changes and continued stagnation I called for a go-around. We never received a Windshear Warning but it seems as if it was windshear. I notified Tower of the go-around and called positive rate. Captain responded with gear up and the speed increased quickly as if on the backside of the windshear. I mentally calculated it to be about a 30 KT shift and let ATC know. At this time the flap speeds were exceeded. I made a callout to pitch up since we were well below the command bars, more pitch was needed to get into the command bars or less power due to the intermediate go-around, the speed was increasing so fast that I treated it like a windshear and reconfigured the flaps on speed just announcing it and not waiting for the command. ATC assigned runway heading and 2,000 after we had already passed that altitude on our way to 2,700, I set 2,000 and selected and then ATC assigned 3,000, I set that altitude and selected. First and foremost I think the ATC facility should not have been using this runway. They continued to use it after we went around and announced the windshear. After landing we sat on the parallel taxiway watching the other aircraft land on [Runway] 22 and seeing the lightning strikes that surrounded them and knowing they were just realizing it when the were coming through the base layer left me with a feeling of disappointment in ATC. I know they do not like changing runways around but when the other 3 directions did not have any Convective activity and the winds were actually favoring landing on [runways] 4 or 31 according to the windsock, the runway change should happen faster. As far a piloting the aircraft goes. I feel more time training intermediate go-arounds and proper ways to turn off, when to turn off, and what to do when autothrust is not doing what is desired is needed. Trying to get the thrust to come up due to slow speed by bumping it up above CLB is poor technique. The entire situation would have been prevented by simply turning off the autothrust and setting about 60% N1 for configuration full to fix the slow speed. This should be previously trained and frequently practiced on the line. Additional training should also be done on intermediate go-arounds and what to do with pitch and power and how long TOGA is needed. ATC increased the confusion of the situation by having a published altitude, followed by an altitude we were already passing (2,000 FT) followed by a new altitude (3,000 FT) in an already complex situation.				A320 First Officer describes an ILS approach to Runway 22 at LGA with lightning, turbulence and possible windshear. The autothrust system is not maintaining the desired reference speed and the Captain's 'technique' to override it is not successful. A go-around is announced by the First Officer, above 1,000 FT, resulting in flap speed and altitude exceedances.

The shudder reduced to zero. During the initial event the left EGT indication cycled rapidly from min to max and then failed. Except for the missing EGT indication, all engine indications were normal. An emergency was declared and ARFF was requested. A turn to 180 degrees was requested so that we would be on a right downwind for the runway. The Emergency Landing and Overweight Landing checklists were accomplished. A flap 25 landing was performed with a landing weight of approximately 620,000 LBS. Reverse was not used on the left engine and full reverse was used on the right. Manual braking was applied at approximately 130 KTS. All but about 1,000 FT of runway was used. After clearing the runway we requested ARFF perform a visual inspection of the left engine and the brakes. The onboard brake temperature system showed all temperatures less than 5.0 except for brake #5 indicating 5.1 and brake #9 indicating 5.5. Most brakes were indicating less than 4.0. ARFF said the left brake was smoking and applied water to all brakes, left and right side, to cool what I thought were fairly normal brake temperatures for this situation. I was unable to communicate directly with the Fire Chief. A discrete frequency was requested from Ground Control. We were told that we would have to communicate through the Ground Controller to the Fire Chief. I requested that we be towed to the gate to deplane the passengers. Ground requested we deplane the passengers on the taxiway using stairs. I requested a gate several times. I was unable to get the aircraft to a gate and the aircraft was towed to the ramp and deplaned using stairs. The passengers were bussed to the terminal.		[No additional information contained in this report.]		The crew of a Boeing 777-200 climbing through about 6,000 FT felt a jolt and a mild shudder that dissipated to zero after approximately 30 seconds, followed by failure of the left engine EGT. All other indications remained normal, an emergency was declared and a return and overweight landing was conducted at the departure airport.

Aircraft was passing FL 340, slightly nose high, wings level with 32,000 LBS FOB. Immediate level off executed, The QRH Fuel Filter Bypass procedure was accomplished and an emergency declared with Center. An immediate return to our departure airport was issued and executed. Overweight checklist and Emergency Landing checklist accomplished as well as all required coordination. Captain executed flawless overweight landing at 151,500 LBS less than 100 FPM, 29,300 FOB and very soft landing followed by a normal taxi to a gate where the aircraft was removed from service. The Fuel Filter Bypass QRH for one engine is very vague and non-directive. It offers no remedy or [directed] course of action re continued flight or landing. It has a note that you may encounter erratic engine operation or flameout and that is all. With 2 lights it states to land at nearest suitable airport.		Our logic for the decision to return was that the light reflects an abnormal operation/malfunction, we don't know the cause. It may have been caused by contaminated fuel, the condition may lead to loss of one or both engines, the mountain range and darkness lie ahead, let's return to the airport. The QRH lacks specific guidance to continue or land in the case of a single filter bypass light, but in the case of both left and right lights [directs flight crews] to land at the nearest suitable field. I would have appreciated more refined text to guide us through the continue or land decision process. The day following this event, I received a call from the B-737 Fleet Manager inquiring as to my decision process leading to our return. Although she stated time and again that she was not 'second guessing' my decision, I felt strongly that she was. There was a condescending tone and she stated that other pilots fly with that condition, but should probably not fly over [large bodies of] water. I'm shining a light on this Fleet Manager's conversation because I feel that it was inappropriate in this context. While it may not be rated as 'pilot pushing' it was somewhat intimidating and might play a role in a future wrong choice as this conversation replays in my head.		A B737NG flight crew declared an emergency and returned to their departure airport following receipt of a FUEL FILTER BYPASS warning. The crew stated they believed the QRH procedure addressing a single filter bypass provided insufficient guidance with respect to continuing their flight when only one engine displayed the condition. A call to the Captain requesting justification for his decision was deemed by the Captain to have been coercive and intended to intimidate against future decisions which might compromise normal operations.

Took as much fuel as ATOG would allow. Checked in halfway with Dispatch, was told weather had moved through. Entering Florida, we got a route that took us in big loop to approach ZZZ from the south. Sent route to Dispatch, was told weather was building again, two alternates, ZZZ1 and ZZZ2. Got holding prior to ZZZ. Weather looked terrible over ZZZ, no way to get through to ZZZ1. Clear to ZZZ2. ATC was saturated. First Officer got a word in about making plans to divert, ATC took it as immediate divert, gave us priority. This was fine, weather started building in ZZZ2. Told Dispatch was diverting to ZZZ2. Set up for ILS (visual conditions), then ATC changed runway due to new thunderstorm. Set up for new runway, far too high due to ATC change. Tried to get down, got hit by +20 airspeed shear. Another carrier went around in front due to windshear. We weren't going to be stable, so went around. [We] came back in for second try. Another airline went around due to conditions in front of us. Visual conditions until very short final, [were] huge downburst and windshear, not safe to land. [We] went around. Departure said ZZZ was now better than ZZZ2. Still had 6.5 gas, went to ZZZ. Told Dispatch. Set up for 10L ILS, shot approach. Short final, Tower called 3,000 RVR due to heavy rain, below minimums. Lost sight of the runway and went around. [We were] informed that ZZZ1 was now 'light rain,' diverted to ZZZ1 with 5.2, shot visual, landed.I guarantee I made mistakes in diversion planning, approaches and missed approaches. ATC was nothing but helpful, but we were operating with incomplete information. Tighter coordination with Dispatch and ATC; unfortunately, both were saturated. Our onboard radar was not useful, just showed red without enough resolution to find best route. Dispatch was trying, but there were diversions everywhere. They weren't much help in picking good diversion plan. ATC helped a lot, but their choice of runways didn't work. Luckily, I started the diversion with enough fuel to have choices.' Fast-building thunderstorms cut off both alternates and required multiple missed approaches.				B737-700 Captain reports multiple missed approaches at two airports due to weather, finally landing at a third with less than 5,000 LBS of fuel.

At 1,100 FT we were on profile with the PAPI showing two white and two red lights. We were 3 miles from touchdown and descending at about 700 FT per minute. At this point the Tower Controller transmitted, 'low altitude alert, check your altitude immediately.' This caused us to delay our 1,000 FT call and was very distracting. We replied that we were on profile and that the PAPI confirmed that. A short time later the Tower Controller transmitted 'no comment'.

We advised the flight attendants to turn off all ovens as a precaution, and then asked if the smell/odor dissipated after a while. After a short while, one Flight Attendant reported being light headed and dizzy, then later was nauseated. Eventually this Flight Attendant had to be seated and was tended to by an on board physician with oxygen. A little while later a second Flight Attendant was reported as having the same symptoms and was treated similarly. At that point we turned off power to the aft galley using our switch on the overhead panel. We also advised ATC of a possible medical emergency involving flight attendants on board. After both flight attendants received oxygen, they were reported to be improving physically for a short time. Some time later a third Flight Attendant was reported as having similar symptoms and one of the other flight attendants had passed out. We decided at that point to divert for medical assistance. We advised ATC of our intentions and we were cleared direct to the divert airport. On short final to land 2 of the flight attendants were reported to have passed out. We proceeded to our gate after landing and paramedics met the aircraft to remove all of our flight attendants and transport them to the hospital for treatment. Cause is unknown at this time. Neither pilot was affected by the odor/smell from the flight deck. We could not smell it at that part of the aircraft.		Flight attendant incapacitation from unknown cause leading to a medical diversion. Climbing through FL260, aft Flight Attendant complained of possible burning smell in aft galley area. I directed all ovens turned off and galley power was subsequently removed. At FL320, B Flight Attendant complained of feeling slightly light headed and some dizziness. I directed her to remain seated and asked the other flight attendants to assess. Aft cabin flight attendants continued to complain of a mild odor that they described as an oily smell, so I directed them to look for possible spills in overhead bins from passenger bags, and other areas of the cabin that could explain any unusual odors. Approximately 30 minutes into the flight a second main cabin (C) Flight Attendant began to feel symptoms of dizziness and the B Flight Attendant became more ill, possibly loosing consciousness for some period of time. I contacted Dispatch via SATCOM and advised of our situation and discussed possible divert options. Maintenance Control was advised, but they were not able to provide any possible solutions. I was patched to MedLink and began the process of treating the B Flight Attendant with O2 and apple juice to which she responded positively, but still felt ill. I asked the C Flight Attendant to remain seated and she was also administered O2. We had an ER physician on board who was very helpful to the sick flight attendants and in advising me of the situation and he was the main contact with MedLink on the headset. I declared a medical emergency with ATC shortly after when I began the process of talking on SATCOM to Dispatch and MedLink. I told ATC that I felt it prudent to declare the emergency due to all of the distractions in the flight deck that could lead to a missed radio call. I asked ATC to keep an eye on us while we sorted out the problem. The process with MedLink was ongoing and they advised me to continue the flight to [our destination] and call back if the B Flight Attendant's condition changed. MedLink and the physician on board were satisfied that the condition of my sick Flight Attendant was not serious.I spoke in length to the physician and he was not able to smell any odors and he felt fine and did not observe any passengers who looked ill and no passenger complained of any problems. My A Flight Attendant called to complain of a possible oily smell in the front of the cabin and said she was feeling a little dizzy and light headed. I directed her to cease her service and sit down. She continued her service for some time, but then asked the D Flight Attendant to come to the front while she went to the back. Shortly after that the A Flight Attendant became ill with symptoms of dizziness, light headedness, burning throat and may have lost consciousness for a period of time. At this point I had one Flight Attendant who was able to perform her duties, two flight attendants who were incapacitated and one Flight Attendant who was feeling ill. The source of the illnesses was not clear, whether a problem with the aircraft of other physiological cause, but my flight attendants' conditions were getting worse and could not be resolved quickly in flight. I initiated a medical divert which gave me 10 minutes to arrange the divert, check performance for the overweight landing, coordinate medical response and brief the divert with my First Officer who remained the pilot flying. I briefed the passengers what we were doing, that the aircraft was completely safe and that we were diverting due to three flight attendants being ill. The diversion was uneventful and all normal procedures were accomplished, normal airspeeds flown and we flew a normal visual approach to XXL and retained our medical emergency status to the gate. We were met by emergency medical responders and the three flight attendants were taken to a Hospital ER and treated for their symptoms and were released. I wrote up the overweight landing and the possible air quality event in the Maintenance logbook, spoke to local Maintenance technicians and secured the aircraft.Unknown cause for three flight attendants becoming ill in flight. All four flight attendants thought that they smelled an odor that was best described as an oily smell that seemed to be more discernible in the aft end of the aircraft (aft of row 23). It is unknown whether the incapacitation of the two flight attendants and illness of the third was due to aircraft malfunction or other physiological causes.		Three B737-800 flight attendants became ill in flight from what was described by them as an oily smell, so the flight diverted to an enroute airport where medical examinations was administered.

Soon thereafter, another Controller came on the radio and said change of plans and gave us heading 340 and plan on RNAV visual 19L. About 20 miles from field, cleared direct TRROP RNAV visual 19R behind a 757. Spacing was a little tight; the 757 was widening out his visual approach, and the RNAV routing was taking us in tighter. So Approach cleared us to widen it out to ensure spacing with the 757 and cleared us a visual to 19R. Radio traffic was congested, and the controllers sounded somewhat stressed. After going to Tower, the Controller said any one who heard her voice to switch to 119.9, which we did. I was manually flying the aircraft and slowed down and configured to ensure adequate spacing and followed the 757 path to turn final about two miles north of the stratosphere. Started a gradual descent down to 3,500 FT MSL and configured to slow. I noticed on TCAS an aircraft above us by 1,000 FT descending with us. As I observed, it slowly got closer, and I asked the Captain to query Tower if they were aware of the traffic descending above us (which by this time was causing a TCAS Traffic Advisory). They told us it was (another carrier) who was maintaining visual separation with us. I looked up out of my right window and saw the traffic, and wondered how they could see us since I was almost looking straight up at them. While continuing on base, the other carrier continued to descend into us and we received a TCAS RA to descend. By this time I was at 3,500 FT MSL (about 1,500 FT AGL). I followed the RA command while the Captain informed Tower. I was very concerned about descending quickly so close to the ground with a lot of tall buildings nearby, but did so carefully. The Captain informed Tower of the RA and they asked us our intentions. The Captain said we were complying with the RA command and planned to still proceed to the field if possible. We couldn't go-around at the time because that would have taken us into the other aircraft and would not have complied with the RA. What was frustrating was as I descended to 1,000 FT AGL the conflicting traffic continued to descend with us and came within 400 FT vertical. The Captain said he saw them come within 300 FT vertical on his TCAS. As I leveled at 1,000 FT AGL and cleared outside to ensure we didn't overfly final and get any closer to the buildings, the TCAS RA was resolved. By this time I was also rolling out on final north of the stratosphere and proceeded inbound to 19R. The Captain told me to look left out his window and I was somewhat shocked to see the other carrier co-altitude and abeam us on final to 19L. We were concerned about the horizontal displacement, but after assessing the situation and seeing aircraft airborne departing Runway 25, felt it was safe and more prudent to land the aircraft than to do a go-around. After landing, Ground Control relayed a phone number for the Captain to call Tower, so they could get more information on the RA. As I replay the event, I keep thinking we followed the clearance given us, ensured proper spacing with the 757 gave Tower a heads up of the impending traffic conflict, properly followed the TCAS RA while staying away from terrain/obstacles, and safely landed the plane. While we thought of performing a go-around, we initially couldn't because of the traffic conflict, and once on final felt it was safer and more prudent to land the plane. Extremely unsettling circumstances, I don't ever recall hearing this other carrier on frequency. A few questions: Why did the other carrier not also receive a TCAS RA, and if they did, why didn't they follow it but continue to descend with us? Did they truly have us in sight the whole time? I saw them only that one time as they flew over us until I rolled out on final. Why did Tower clear them the visual to 19L and us to 19R when the conflict could have been avoided if they'd been sent to 19R and us to 19L? I thought as a crew we handled all the threats well and avoided a potentially catastrophic outcome.		ATC never advised us of the traffic and our flight paths would cross. As the pilot flying flew the RA, I verified the traffic on the map display and noticed the aircraft was just off our tail and 300 FT above us continuing to descend on top of us. I looked behind me an saw the aircraft descending and now parallel and overtaking us as he was lined up for 19L. We were still receiving an RA and at no time did the other aircraft initiate a go-around or seem like they were compiling with an RA on their side. We continued to comply with the RA until below the PAPI and 1,000 FT AGL, the RA ceased and we leveled to regain the PAPI and continued the approach.		An air carrier crew descending to LAS 19R took evasive action responding to a TCAS RA and descended to 1,000 FT AGL evading an air carrier aircraft to 19L which was within 300 FT, but did not take evasive action.

We ran EECs Alternate Mode Checklist bringing EECs to hard altitude. Couple minutes after going to hard altitude on EECs autothrottles disconnected and would not engage, quick review of that checklist no real issue. Quickly briefed the flight attendants to expect an uneventful landing and advised the passengers of indication problems and that ARFF crews would be standing by as a precaution not to be alarmed. Leaving holding broke out into VMC conditions and decided and determined that we would attempt to stay in VMC. In the descent [an EICAS] Recall Check revealed a speed trim light, with no trim control difficulties, referenced Speed Trim Fail Checklist no difficulties.

The 'squeal' transmitted with all ATC transmissions is so loud as to cause pain. Their instructions are unreadable at a safe volume. In the event we, or any aircraft, had to coordinate emergency actions, or receive emergency instructions from ATC, the likelihood of understanding their transmission is very minimal. The burden and frustration a crew might encounter in order to communicate with ATC at this point would only compound what might already be a task saturated situation. In summation, the existing 'squeal' on Maiquetia 127.95 is unsafe. This noise interference occurs every time I fly through their airspace.				Air Carrier reporter claims 127.95 utilized by Maiquetia is unusable for ATC in some locations due to a loud 'squeal' preventing communications.

Prepped for Runway 27R, thus had programmed the arrival from SOOLU to HIMGO. Just prior to SOOLU, ORD Approach Control gave us a descent to 7,000 FT and expect [Runway] 28R. I went heads down to reprogram [Runway] 28R and the First Officer started a descent to 7,000 FT in [LVL] CHG, still at 300 KTS. When the [Runway] 28R approach was selected, the arrival changed from the north to HIMGO to the south to TONIE, VERY disorienting. Several seconds discussion was initiated between pilots as to where to go. As we referenced the chart and looked at the display, we noticed we were at 7,000 FT still at 300 KTS. Started slowing to 250 KTS and using heading select to get back towards JORJO, ORD Approach called and asked if we were on the approach. We stated we were heading to JORJO, and then they gave us direct to MONKZ. Rest of approach and landing was normal. EXCEPT: on landing roll, ORD Tower was giving us taxiing instructions: 'exit M1, M, cross Runway 32L, and stay with me.' Dangerous and dangerous as we are still at 80 KTS and slowing.Changing runways is a fact of life, BUT to assign a runway close to the airport JUST prior to a significant change in the direction of the arrival is unsafe and unsound. They were telling us that they would give us a short approach, and in their haste to get the aircraft on the ground, they almost created an unsafe condition. DO NOT assign runways or change unless significant time is given to comply. Another way to help would be to assign the new runway and give a heading or direct to a point of the new part of the arrival. Keeping us at 300 KTS was inviting problems as they want you to slow and descend and turn early for an approach. UNSAFE. Do not assign a high rate of speed and a lower altitude without calling: 'Slow to 250 KTS, then descend to 7,000 FT.'		On BULLZ arrival assigned 300 KTS going to Runway 27R. Just prior SOOLU we were given a decent 7,000 FT and runway change to Runway 28R. The pilot not flying went heads down to make the change to the FMC, as the change was inserted the airplane made a significant turn to the right. Causing a bit of distraction and confusion for me, I took the airplane out of LNAV and went to HDG select as the magenta line seemed to disappear. I ended up on a heading pointed somewhere between JORJO and MONKZ. With the confusion of the course changes I did not notice our speed was still 300 KTS and we were below 10,000 FT. As soon as I noticed we were still at 300 KTS I immediately slowed the plane back to 250. And when we were about to contact Approach they called us and gave us direct to MONKZ. At that point we were back on an ATC approved aircraft path and speed. The rest of the approach and landing were normal except while still at a relatively high speed we were exit M1 M cross 32L and stay with me. The fact that we changed runways at the last minute and were left on the arrival contributed to this. A better solution from Approach would have been a heading along with the new runway assignment. I did not have any experience with runway changes at ORD at the last minute while still on arrival. This contributed significantly to my confusion, if the same thing were to happen again I think I would be able to handle it better. Still I think runway changes that affect the arrival should come with a heading change rather than an assumption of continuing the arrival. The runway exit instruction should have probably been abbreviated to exit at M1 one stay with me.		B737-800 flight crew reports a track deviation and an overspeed during the BULLZ 5 arrival to ORD Runway 27R when ATC switches to Runway 28R just as the flight is approaching SOOLU. SOOLU is the point at which the arrival diverges for Runway 28R and the crew is not prepared for the changes that occur when the FMC is reprogrammed.

We were flying to the airport in anticipation of an ILS to RWY 10 when ATC notified us that windshear had been reported at the airport and to expect holding. The Controller immediately gave us instructions to hold SW on the ATL 230 degree radial at 20 DME, right turns.Given that we were on vectors and no longer on the magenta line, the holding information took us a little by surprise and the PF put the information into the fix page to give us a clue where we were in relation to the holding fix while I set up the FMS to enter the holding information. The Controller queried us as to whether we were heading to the holding fix and while we had started a slow turn toward it, I wasn't completely certain where we were in relation to the fix as my head was down programming the FMS. We had not received a vector toward the fix and given that we were being vectored toward final approach just prior to getting holding instructions it took a minute to do a quick fix to fix and load the information into the FMS. The Captain turned us toward the fix while I got the holding instructions loaded and we entered holding. We then requested a change in the fix as the 20 DME fix was close enough to buildups that we wanted to avoid the weather. The Controller extended the holding point to the 25 DME fix, 10 mile legs which we complied with until we left holding for a successful approach and landing in ATL. Fortunately, we cover holding in almost every recurrent training session and I knew that to load the FMS we had to 'go there' to 'hold there', but it still came as a surprise and took longer than I would have liked to ensure we were headed to the fix in a timely manner.				While on a vector to the ILS final a B777 flight crew was surprised by a clearance to hold at an unpublished VOR Radial/DME fix which had to be programmed independent of their active route. The delay which resulted caused ATC to query their track toward the holding fix.

There was an FAA Inspector on the jumpseat from XXX to DEN. We made slight diversions during arrival for weather South of DEN, but the approach and airport environment were in clear weather conditions. I cannot remember if we were given 34R from the beginning, or if that was a change in runway assignment from the original clearance. During the approach, at approximately 200 feet to 300 feet AGL, the Tower instructed us to go-around for 'traffic down field.'  Both the Captain and I thought they had issued this instruction to a similar call sign because it did not sound exactly like Company XXX. I remember that because I was frustrated with myself for missing the critical call and not questioning ATC sooner when, given the slow arrival rate at the time and our position, it was most likely for us. I did question ATC and was told for us to go-around.  All three of us in the cockpit were somewhat confused as to the reason since none of us saw any traffic at all 'down field.' We had assumed maybe it was a vehicle that we just couldn't see and completed the go-around and subsequent landing without incident. Today I received a call from the DEN Chief Pilot's office stating that there is going to be a meeting about the cause of this error and how to prevent similar occurrences in the future. I was told that there was a Dash 8 somewhere on Taxiway WB that posed a separation issue. To be honest, looking at the airport diagram, I was not aware, even though none of us saw an aircraft or vehicle, that one could not be present on the taxiway while another is landing 34R. I can clearly see the safety concern, but how far from the runway end is considered okay to taxi? Is WA, B4, B, or Runway 25 far enough for an aircraft to be on while one is landing 34R? This is not meant to be a sarcastic question, but I honestly don't know with an airport layout like DEN, how far out from the runway end is far enough. Once we landed, we discussed the go-around with the FAA Inspector and we were all still confused as to the reason why and repeated that none of us saw any traffic. The Inspector then stated that he would check into it more the next day and determine for his own knowledge the issues behind it. Better controlling and monitoring on the part of ATC, clearer go-around instructions especially when the aircraft is at such a low altitude, proactive control on the part of ATC so that the aircraft is not assigned a go-around that low, better knowledge on the crews, i.e. where it is acceptable to have an aircraft taxiing when you are landing, better observation of ground movement operations by the crew during the landing phase, and quicker questioning of ATC by the crew when not sure if the critical go-around call was for your flight.		We were cleared for a visual approach to 34R backed up by the ILS by Approach Control. After checking in with DEN Tower, we were cleared to land on 34R. At 100 feet AGL, the Control Tower told is to go-around. A normal go-around was completed. We were then switched to Departure frequency, who gave us RADAR vectors for a box pattern. We were then told to contact Tower. Upon checking in with DEN Tower, they cleared us to land again on 34R. Up until the Tower initiated go-around, the entire approach was normal. I have been informed that the go-around was due to our aircraft overflying an aircraft taxiing on Taxiway WB. Due to the angle of attack on approach, neither my First Officer nor I ever saw the taxiing aircraft.		Air carrier on short final to DEN Runway 34R was issued a go-around apparently because of a potential conflict with taxiing aircraft.

Initially, we observed the aircraft begin to deviate to left heading with rapidly increasing left crosswind at 180/200+ knots and increasing. Next, we observed autopilot trying to correct and aircraft was deviating south of course. At this point, we began crosscheck with other instruments and communicated to each other what we observed. As we were trying to determine who had good data, the right IRS Fault light illuminated, and I took command of the aircraft, as the First Officer's CDU lost attitude and altitude data. I was suddenly hand flying at FL380 as First Officer pulled QRH to begin checklist. We were in clear air and I stabilized heading and altitude while we communicated with ATC that we needed a heading. I was hand flying at FL380 for first time, probably ever, in my career. It's a real different experience than hand flying below 10,000 feet.As I tried to follow with back up the First Officer as he read and executed the QRH, I unintentionally allowed the aircraft to climb to 38,320 feet, momentarily, before correcting back to FL380. CLE Center asked us our altitude and we acknowledged that we had briefly been at 38,300 feet, but had corrected to FL380. We told them we were having to hand fly the aircraft and had a systems malfunction we were trying to diagnose and to stand by. Once we completed QRH, we told them we could not use autopilot and would have to leave RVSM airspace, which we did. Later, after communication with Dispatch, we diverted flight for maintenance and fuel.				A B737-700 flight crew, level at FL380, experienced a malfunctioning IRS causing the First Officer to lose altitude and attitude data. When the Captain assumed control with the autopilot off a modest altitude deviation occurred in part due to lack of experience with hand flying at altitude.

Reduced thrust to idle per immediate action and continued with QRH procedures. Engine recovered to normal operation at flight idle but would stall again when power advanced so we left it at idle, declared an emergency, completed ECAM/QRH and landed at the nearest suitable airport. No visual indication of engine damage or ingestion was found upon inspection on the ground.		The flight attendants called and I told them we had heard it and would get back to them. We set up for a drift down and declared an emergency with Center. They said ZZZ was off the nose at 110 miles if we wanted to go there. I said yes and we were cleared direct. We sent a message to Dispatch letting them know we were diverting and to coordinate things for us. We discussed the single engine profiles, diversion guide, and approach and landing data. We let the flight attendants know the problem and plan, [and] then made a PA explaining the situation to the passengers. We executed a normal single engine visual approach and landing without incident at max landing weight. Good CRM and management along with no rush from the Captain made this a non-event from the pilot's perspective.		An A320 flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to a nearby airport when the right engine compressor stalled at thrust settings above idle.

Landing configuration would be Flaps 30 and Brake Setting #3.  We were cleared the visual to RWY XX by Approach at 3,000 feet MSL.  I decided to start slowing and configuring early and the aircraft was properly configured and on reference speed of 148 KTS plus 5 KTS, approaching the FAF.  The aircraft position was slightly high on visual glide path, so I disengaged the autopilot, left autothrottles engaged, and started a descent to capture normal glide path.  The throttles reduced and the nose was lowered.  When I raised the pitch attitude once the normal visual glide path was attained, I did not notice the autothrottles did not advance.  With the raising of the pitch attitude, the airspeed decreased 15-20 knots below reference speed.  The Captain announced, 'Airspeed' and I immediately overrode the autothrottles and increased power.  The flight path continued on a slight descent when power was increased.  As the airspeed increased, I raised the pitch attitude to level flight and we regained proper pitch, power, airspeed and glide path at approximately 800 feet to 1,000 feet AGL.  All stabilized approach criteria were met before the 500 feet [required] for VMC approaches.  Landing and taxi in were completely uneventful.  Automation is a great tool and works as expected 95% of the time.  I would say that pilots can be 'lulled' into a sense of security when using it.  All the automation in the world does not relieve us of the charge to fly the airplane at all times.  Closer monitoring of approach speed and faster realization of the 'lag' of the autothrottles would have prevented the decrease in airspeed.  Had the situation progressed further, a go-around was, without a doubt, the proper action.  Needless to say, one must remain vigilant in monitoring and assessing all flight parameters at all times.  It's the times when you think you have things 'wired' that you need to maintain total awareness.				B737-800 First Officer, late to recognize slow autothrottle response after raising the pitch attitude on approach, responded to the Captain's 'airspeed' callout and overrode the autothrottles to increase power. Approach was stabilized and preceded uneventfully.

I retarded the throttles to idle, disconnected the autothrottle, and applied brakes. We had barely moved at all. We then waited for the intruding aircraft to clear the runway, confirmed our take off clearance with the Tower, and took off uneventfully. Simply: had we not noticed the intruding aircraft immediately, this event could have had a tragic ending.				B737-800 flight crew cleared for takeoff at MIA airport noted an aircraft crossing the departure runway down field and rejected the takeoff.

The First Officer checked the duct temperature and it was at 200 degrees. This was followed by a 'CAB CONT' light. The First Officer worked the QRH procedure without fixing the problem and the cockpit temperature became a problem. We leveled off at FL250 declared an emergency and coordinated with ATC to divert to a nearby airport. The temperature continued to rise in the cockpit. At this point due to previous write ups on the airplane and our nitrogen system degraded during preflight which the MEL says can be due to a pack overheat, I elected to have the First Officer go to the QRH and disconnect the left pack. This solved the overheat problem in the cockpit. We landed overweight and the airplane was taken out of service. Better coordination with Maintenance. The divert station maintenance crews said the airplane had a history and the degraded nitrogen system should have been a red flag, but was simply deferred.		The CONT ZONE temp light illuminated. The Captain was flying and I completed the QRH checklist for the CONT ZONE Temp. The QRH Zone Temp Checklist did not fix the problem. We leveled off at FL250. The temperature indicated 200 on the gauge for the CONT Duct supply.		A B737-800 with the Nitrogen Gas Generations System disabled, had a flight station temperature rise along with a CAB CONT alert, so the left pack was disconnected, an emergency was declared and the flight diverted for maintenance.

We also had a jumpseater. ATC assigns our flight to descend and maintain FL240. While descending we felt a 'thud' and heard a 'popping' noise originating from the right side of the aircraft. Shortly after we received the following ECAM - ENG 2 STALL. We were at approximately FL250. The Captain, stated, 'You have the airplane, ATC, I will perform ECAM Actions.' The engine continued to stall. Before initiating ECAM, the Captain called for me to reduce power on the right engine. After confirming the 'right Thrust Lever,' I reduced power on the right engine and the engine stalls discontinued at thrust idle. When the engine stalls discontinued, ECAM - ENG 2 STALL cleared.ATC instructed us to descend and maintain one, one thousand feet (11,000 FT). We accepted the descent and the Captain asked me to increase engine two thrust in an effort to recheck the operation of the engine. A total of 3 attempts to increase thrust would all result in the engine stalling with power settings just above idle. (At this time we received a 'cabin call' from a flight attendant. We ignored the 'cabin call' yet called and spoke to the Lead Flight Attendant several minutes later explaining the situation.) Thrust was then set to idle and the Captain performed COM - ENG 1 (2) STALL resulting in an engine shut down. COM ENG 1 (2) SHUT DOWN was referenced and completed. The APU was started and used. I declared an emergency with ATC while continuing the descent to our destination airport. Captain notified Dispatch via ACARS that we had declared an emergency. Captain also called the cabin and spoke with the Lead Flight Attendant explaining the type of emergency, evacuation would not be necessary, estimated time before landing and that we would be bringing the aircraft to a stop on the runway for emergency vehicle aircraft. Approximately 15 NM from our destination the Captain requested control of the aircraft before landing and I notified the passengers. Airport Tower ATC asked if we needed emergency vehicles. We stated affirmative. ATIS weather conditions were calm winds, 10 SM visibility and clear skies, temperature 24 due point 22, altimeter 29.97. The landing was a visual approach backed up with the RNAV Runway 18 made with Flaps 3 configuration, Engine 1 autothrust MCT, hand flown inside the FAF. The Captain brought the aircraft to a stop using medium autobrakes and idle reverse on the operating engine, set the parking brake and made a PA, 'Flight Attendants Stations.' As a precaution we referenced the Emergency Evacuation Checklist. Airport Fire and Rescue approached the airplane to assess the exterior condition of the aircraft. Fire and Rescue stated the aircraft appeared to be good condition. The Captain made another PA announcement, 'Remain Seated, Remain Seated.' We then taxied the aircraft, exiting the runway, performed the After Landing Checklist and proceeded to the gate without further incident. Learned that the low bleed valve on the IAE engines have issues, hopefully a fix will be forthcoming soon. Also perhaps a read file to other pilots that this issue is happening and that they should review appropriate checklist for engine compressor stalls.				An A320 ECAM alerted ENG 2 STALL during descent, so an emergency was declared, the Captain completed the ENG 1 (2) STALL ECAM, the engine was shutdown and the flight continued to the filed destination.

I yelled, 'Your pitch is too high; I got it.' I pushed over without negative G and stabilized the climb. The copilot said he was looking outside and must have gotten a false horizon since we took off to the north over the water at night. He was now fine and he continued to fly the next two legs flawlessly. He has always been in the top 25% of the pilots I have flown with and is very sharp, but couldn't remember anything like this happening before. He has always espoused that the younger pilots don't do enough hand flying to keep up proficiency, but in this case it was the opposite of not relying on flight director and instruments. I thought I should report this since it shows how it can affect even the highest skill level late in an airline career. What will never be known is when he would have discovered his visual disorientation and if he could have recovered. I remember an Airbus 320 accident similar due to the Captains disorientation at night visual over the water after takeoff that occurred a few years ago in the Middle East.				B777 Captain took control of the aircraft when the First Officer exceeded 20 degrees pitch with decreasing airspeed on a visual, hand-flown departure. First Officer attributed the pitch increase to the perception of a false horizon over water at night.

The engine instruments were winding down and we had a right engine fail EICAS message.  We were at Flaps 1 and at 210 KTS.  The Captain took control of the airplane and called for the checklist.  I pulled up the Right Engine Fail checklist.  We started doing the immediate action items.  We did the autothrottle arm switch - right - confirm- off.

We abandoned the right engine fail checklist and reconnected the right autothrottle arm switch.  At this time both engines were running and the Captain made the decision to continue the approach.  We declared an emergency, told ATC that we had lost an engine but had restarted it and asked to be met by ARFF.  Now we noticed we had a TAC [Thrust Asymmetry Compensation] Failure checklist to complete.  We accomplished that checklist and the TAC re-engaged.  We also had a status message R Engine Control.  We finished the descent checklist (we still had not gone through transition) and configured the airplane for landing.  We discussed changing the flap setting to 25 but decided with the tailwind 30 would be better.  We accomplished the before landing checklist.  We landed uneventfully and taxied to the gate.				While configuring for approach the flight crew of a B777-200 suffered a right engine failure.  Before they could complete the engine fail checklist the auto-relight system restarted the engine and the flight crew continued to land after declaring an emergency and requesting CFR in case the situation deteriorated.

Aircraft was in VNAV.  All altimeters were correct with no splits.  I would think that this is just a glitch, but this is the third time I've had it happen in different aircraft over the last three weeks.  It happens in VNAV mode only and errors have been between 140 FT and 400 FT every time.  I don't know if there has been some sort of software update recently but again it has happened repeatedly with different first officers so I don't think that it is just me screwing up the FMC.	The reporter stated that he did not realize until the third occurrence of the early level off that this anomaly was aircraft related and not a crew error. He is now vigilant during every approach to a level off. In order to correct the early level off, the aircraft is put in a Vertical Speed Mode (VS) descent and it then levels at MCP selected altitude.			A B737-700 Captain noted that a series of aircraft autopilots level off between 150 FT and 400 FT early during descents in VNAV.

We were on vectors to 27 and on downwind. We were following an airbus and a 757 in sequence. We were aware of those two aircraft and had visual on both. Weather was VFR, but getting dark. We were cleared to descend to 3,000 FT.We noticed a hit on our TCAS that was not pointed out by ATC nor made any radio transmissions that we heard. We looked for the traffic, but did not see anything. I actually thought it might have been a ghost hit. We were given a vector to a base leg. While in the turn and leveling off at 3,000 we received an RA. There was an aircraft in our path we could not see (we were looking and I now think he was climbing). We complied with the RA and received a 'clear of conflict' oral message. I immediately informed ATC that we had an RA and had to maneuver the aircraft to avoid collision. I inquired about the traffic. The Controller stated that we had plenty of clearance from the traffic. I was stunned. I felt like we were put in a very bad spot and the Controller did not have a clue. Maybe my bad for thinking a ghost target, but I still had very good SA [Situational Awareness]. We were constantly clearing outside and we were aware of the TA hit on TCAS. We did not know that aircraft's trends. We eventually were within 500 FT of the traffic. I am not saying I am perfect, however, my SA was pretty high. My concern is that we were put in a position that we should not have been put in. We were being vectored to final at one of the nation's busiest airports at night. ATC never pointed out the conflicting traffic. We had SA on hit on TCAS. Controller never said anything. After RA, Controller said 'traffic was not a factor'. I was so upset. I asked for his phone number. Captain called him last night. I could not. I was completely dumbfounded by what I heard and thought I was much too upset and angry to talk to a Controller with very low SA. This was not a good moment.		TCAS alert at 3,000 FT on approach into Boston.		While being vectored for an approach at BOS the flight crew of a B737-800 responded to a TCAS RA with an aircraft with which they never had visual conrtact. ATC advised there was no apparent traffic conflict. The First Officer was upset with the response which he believed failed to address what he believed to have been a near collision.

The Captain had planned for a simulated AIII approach for training/currency.  The Captain was flying and we encountered some wake turbulence behind the B777, so Captain elected to fly slightly above the descent path, asked if I agreed, and I concurred. We were vectored to final, first heading 150, and asked if we had the field, which we called in sight.  Next vector was heading 220 to intercept final and cleared us the visual 24R.  The Captain stated we were slightly high due to the wake turbulence avoidance and began correcting.  The autopilot was disconnected and we began to configure.  The Captain then asked to verify AIII mode.  I went heads down, saw we weren't, and toggled to AIII.  During this time, we overshot 24R final slightly and began an immediate correction.  Simultaneously, Approach Control instructed us to fly a heading to re-intercept.  I do not remember the assigned heading.  The Captain intercepted final and the remainder of the approach and landing were uneventful. Perhaps we could have asked Approach for a slightly longer final as we remained above the 777 wake turbulence.  As Pilot Monitoring, at the critical phase of flight, I could have focused solely on the intercept to final rather than going heads down.		While the ATIS called for VFR conditions and we did have the airport in sight, it was extremely hazy. As I was transitioning my scan from the inside to the outside for the visual approach and back to the inside to check for configuration speeds, I briefly mistook Runway 24L with 24R and flew through the Localizer. I immediately corrected to re-intercept at which point the Controller called us to re-intercept from the other side. There was no conflict with other traffic that I know of.		B737-700 flight crew reported deviating from cleared track on approach to LAX. Wake vortex concerns and haze were contributing factors.

I expected to wait the two minutes and saw an aircraft that appeared to be on final to Runway 8. Then, Tower advised us there were two helicopters where we saw that traffic and they would be passing southwest of the airport. We called them in sight and they also called us in sight. We were cleared for takeoff. We could just see the aircraft over the hangars west of Runway 15, but we knew we could keep them in sight during the takeoff roll. As we became airborne, it became obvious the track of the helicopters was closer that I had estimated before takeoff roll. I became very concerned that our SID heading to 210 degrees was going to put us in very close proximity to the helicopters with about a 90-degree intercept. I delayed the turn until about 1,000 FT AGL (1,800 MSL). I think the helicopters were about 1,200 FT AGL. I remained at V2 to V2 plus 20 until over 2000 MSL. We received a TCAS TA at some point as we climbed over the helicopters. As we got switched to Departure, I told BUR Tower I wasn't happy with the separation we had with the helicopters.After getting above 10,000 I called the Tower back and informed him I was filing a near mid-air collision report so he was aware and could mark the tapes. We were in a -700 with only 30 or so passengers so our climb was very good. Had we been full of passengers and/or in a -300, I feel there would have been a significant risk of a collision. While all aircraft had each other in sight, I don't know if the helicopters would have been able to avoid us had our climb been slower or had not delayed the turn to a 90-degree intercept and 200 knots of speed. BUR Tower was trying to help expedite us but, if we had waited less than a minute, the helicopters would have been well past our planned departure track. Had I been able to see the picture on a radar screen, I would not have accepted the takeoff clearance.				A B737-700 flight crew departing BUR was distressed when, after advising them of two helicopters in the general vicinity of their SID departure path and, after confirmation of visual contact by all flight crews involved, the Tower cleared them for takeoff.  The reporter elected to make an NMAC report due to their in-flight proximity to the helicopters.

The QNH at the time 1000 HP. Several factors can be factored into the event, 1. Long day (fatigue) 2. Weather associated with a typhoon 3. Operating in the China meters environment 4. Communication challenges with the Chinese Controller 5. Change of arrivals [at] the transition level switch of the altimeters was missed by the entire crew as we descended, and to the best I can recall it was about this time that the Controller finally assigned an arrival which was different from what we had loaded/expected. We had the GYA 1W arrival loaded and were switched to the GYA 1Y arrival.I could have done a better job backing up the Captain and First Officer. We had several times in the descent where it was tough to understand the Controller's instructions and it was an extremely busy on the radios due to the amount of arrival traffic and weather in the area from the outer bands of the typhoon. We could have queried the Controller on what arrival to expect sooner to avoid the higher workload of switching the arrivals while descending. This is only the second trip I have flown as a Relief Pilot and wasn't really sure what I should be concentrating my attention on while backing up the front end crew. In the future I will be more diligent in watching the arrival procedures and try to maintain better overall situational awareness.		Typhoon-type weather conditions in area with lots of CBs and turbulence. While descending, vectored off arrival due traffic. While on vector arrival changed to GYA 1W for 02L. Crew accomplished change and noted new mins. Then re-vectored back to arrival and arrival changed back to original. Change again accomplished. Then Approach Control descended aircraft to 2,400 meters/7,900 FT (TL FL108, TA 8,860 FT). Approach did not issue altitude instruction with the normal: 'Descent to 2,400 meters on altimeter 1000 HP.' I was concentrating on a large storm at 12 o'clock and trying to get the aircraft down to 7,900 FT as quickly as possible as we were in the approach environment and high, when I saw the altimeter display go yellow at 8,800 FT. We switched altimeters from STD to 1000 HP passing 8,500 FT. Indicated altitude immediately changed to 8,100 FT and the aircraft failed to capture altitude at 7,900 FT. Both the FO and I realized the problem. I disconnected the autopilot passing about 7,850 feet and arrested sink rate. Altitude bottomed out between 7,600 and 7,500 FT and quickly was corrected back to 7,900 feet (2,400 meters).  The Approach Controller must have realized he had not given us the local altimeter setting when descending us below the TL because when he queried us about our altitude he told us to make certain we were on the local altimeter setting of 1000 HP. This pairing which arrives in Guangzhou at around XA30PM is a very fatiguing, back-side-of-the-clock schedule. It is augmented with only a single relief pilot even though it routinely pushes 12 block hours and ends with a demanding descent and approach. When coupled with a weather event such as the typhoon conditions encountered on this trip, it is quite challenging.		The single augmented flight crew of a B777-200, at the end of a 12 hour flight to ZGGG including avoiding typhoon weather, failed to reset their altimeters in a timely fashion as the passed the Transition Level and descended below their cleared altitude.  Fatigue and metric altimetry at low transition levels were cited as contributing factors.

Contacted ATC and was told we had crossed the path of an Airbus 380 20 miles [ahead.] We had winds of 297 at 46 knots. No damage or injuries just the strongest jolt of wake I personally have ever received.		Cruising at FL390, the ride had been perfectly smooth the entire flight, no weather in the area, basically clear skies and great visibility, seatbelt sign was off (auto). Out of nowhere, the aircraft began to roll left wing down and then snapped right wing down and what felt like 'heavy' moderate turbulence lasting about three to four seconds. The autopilot and all FMA modes remained engaged. I would NOT say the aircraft was out of control per the definition of severe turbulence. The Captain checked with the flight attendants to ensure everyone was okay and made a PA explaining to the passengers that everything was okay. Meanwhile, noticing that we had a left-quartering tailwind (247/46), I asked ATC if we were following another aircraft (nothing seen on our TCAS.) ATC replied we were not. I reported our encounter with clear air turbulence and he looked further into the matter. After his investigation, we were informed that indeed an Airbus A380 had crossed over ahead of us at FL400 prior to our encounter. I informed him that in this situation, with a quartering tailwind, it's most likely we would encounter the wake of a larger aircraft. ATC took down the information of the encounter and advised us he would document the event and look into changing their vertical separation and be more aware of a tailwind condition for the smaller following traffic. Immediately after the wake turbulence, we resumed a smooth ride for the duration of cruise flight. No injuries or aircraft damage occurred during this event.		B737-700 flight crew reported wake vortex encounter at FL390 when an Airbus A380 crossed their path at FL400. The wake encounter resulted in a sharp roll to the left and then right.

I took over in level change at the ATC assigned crossover speed, 290 KTS and descended. With the tailwind we needed increased speed, got that approved from ATC and descended close to the barber pole. As we approached the barber pole I disconnected the auto pilot and hand flew the descent. When I disconnected the autopilot the speed momentarily equaled or exceeded Vmo and we had an overspeed warning. The warning lasted for approximately three seconds before we slowed to below the placarded speed. We were given relief from the speed restriction from ATC (290 KTS) and as we approached HOGGS we switched ATC frequencies and the NY Center now assigned us a speed and not the altitude crossing even though we were in the turn over HOGGS and leveling at FL180. Being a bit more aware of the tailwind in the descent and catching the VNAV not catching the profile would have avoided this. During this flight I realized the First Officer was brand new to the company. He had 65 hours as a new hire 727 First Officer (direct into the right seat) but was then furloughed 12 years and was now a new First Officer on the 737. We spent a good portion of the flight discussing a lot of things he had never seen before. It was actually great to have someone so eager [to learn] and I was more than willing to show him as it is nice to have a First Officer well versed with the things many of us got as flight engineers and first officers when there was more time spent in a classroom environment. In retrospect, when we STARTED the descent out of FL390, we should have moved into the 'descent phase' and ended the classroom circle stuff. The overspeed was [my entire] fault as I was the pilot flying. It was my first trip back after 3 weeks of vacation. I'm sure that played a part in the event.				A B737-800 flight crew, distracted by informal training and indoctrination of the new First Officer, failed to note the jet had not begun a programmed descent in a timely manner. During the hasty descent a short duration Vmo overspeed occurred.

The Captain and I were training on company procedures when ATC asked us to start our descent. We discovered that the descent would be very close to make the crossing restriction. We hadn't realized that the tailwind was stronger than expected, as well. The Captain directed me to ask if we could descend faster than 290 KIAS and ATC approved that. At about FL190, the overspeed clacker went off. The Captain immediately slowed the rate of descent and decelerated below 340 KIAS. The exceedance was for about 2-3 seconds and about 2 KIAS. The Captain took immediate and appropriate action to correct the situation, wrote up the overspeed upon arrival at JFK, and informed Maintenance at JFK.				Distracted by on the job training the flight crew of a B737-800 failed to initiate their descent in a timely manner. During the descent they exceeded Vmo for a brief period.

Add in tailwinds and ATC continuously vectoring us off the arrival and continuously re-assigning speeds. We reduced speeds also because of turbulence. [Finally I] requested ATC re-clear us on the MAJIC STAR. ATC did so. Problem solved.Lots of task loading, turbulent conditions, argumentative ATC. And then later, as I was trying to get home afterwards, my Chief Pilot calling my standby/spare/children's cell phone and leaving me messages to call him on Sunday night when I am OFF! ALL of these things put me 'in the red.'				An A320 Captain expressed his disgust for the IVANE RNAV STAR into CLT advising its complexities exceeded the capabilities of his autoflight system, compelling it to exceed required airspeeds in order to attempt to comply with the associated altitude restrictions. Further difficulties were provided by the demands of ATC to comply with the published restrictions and/or to reassign airspeeds, vector or otherwise interfere with the flight crew's efforts to comply with the published constraints of the arrival. They ultimately refused the IVANE and requested and were assigned the MAJIC, a less complex, non RNAV STAR.

Although the weather was below minimums all day and forecast to remain so, after we delayed for an hour we were told the weather was reported at 400 with 1.5 visibility wind 080/18 making RNAV 36 usable. The Captain agreed to go. We were mishandled by the Enroute Controller who kept us high to accommodate other traffic, which subsequently required us to slow to 270 to drop the gear at 12,000 FT in order to regain the profile for the RNAV approach. We were stable on the arrival with VNAV path and LNAV engaged autopilot on for a RNP 1.5. The Captain thoroughly briefed the autopilot approach then walked through the calls and actions we would perform on the missed approach.  We were told to contact the Tower at (FAF). The Tower cleared us to land and when prompted reported the winds now at 080/29 steady. This was a great increase and startled me. The Captain queried if it was within limits. I checked via the iPad, which necessitated numerous page swipes - a major distraction while inside the FAF. When I looked up, I noted immediately that we had lost VNAV. The Captain stated 'We lost VNAV.' I looked at the altimeter and called 'Approaching DA' and immediately 'DA' The Captain asked if I could see anything and I said 'no - only trees' and he called for the Missed Approach. We continued to sink as he applied power and we executed the missed. I thought we were critically close to the trees and within seconds of contacting them. At the gate, the agent told me the passengers were all commenting on how close the trees were.I don't understand why we lost VNAV. I missed the exact moment we lost it due to being distracted with the iPad, but upon recognition, it seemed there was an unexpected brief delay in the processing of the information before the missed was executed. I believe the Dispatcher pushed the flight to depart when it should not have and I believe the combined meteorological factors precluded this being a safe approach. I don't think 38 feet is enough reported ceiling above DA to render a consistently safe outcome and I think a 29 KT direct crosswind adds enough complication that even though it is technically within limits it's an unsafe margin given the winds swirling against the back of the bowl in the bay, and the angle the autopilot must maintain to comply with the 1.5 RNP. To arrive at the MAP, locate the runway through reduced visibility and cloudy conditions with the extreme crosswind angle, with only 38 feet to establish control and descend safely from the already steep 3.75 glideslope, does not make safety sense in my mind. Had I not been distracted by the iPad search for limits (something I would have already had in front of me with paper), I may have noted the VNAV loss and prompted the need for the missed a 1/2 a beat earlier, but I don't know that I actually would have noticed it any sooner as the Captain articulated it himself a half second behind my recognition. Further, the ceilings were not as reported at our location, and the loss of VNAV was a critical component of a safe approach. If we had lost the LNAV instead, I believe we would have been an accident due to the strong crosswind. As a First Officer I can already tell that as a Captain, I would not descend to minimums on this approach under these conditions even with a functioning VNAV. This approach requires a highly alert crew, reasonable winds, accurate weather reporting and reliable and properly functioning equipment, none of which we had in my opinion.				Air carrier First Officer reported CFTT incident following loss of VNAV on approach in marginal weather conditions.

The note in the logbook cover indicated that the latching function of the yoke PTT switches had been deactivated. In fact, all interphone PTT function on both yoke switches were inoperative. Neither pilot could use the yoke switch to transmit on interphone because neither switch could be depressed down to the INT position. Both switches transmitted normally on the radio.We wrote up what we observed and briefed the oncoming crew. The Mechanic showed up, but we had to go to our next flight before there was any resolution from Maintenance. My read of MEL 23-16 is that with BOTH PTT switches in this state the aircraft can not be dispatched. This makes sense when considering that in a situation where both pilots must be on oxygen, their only option to communicate would be to latch the ASP switch to interphone, filling the interphone with the sound of both pilots breathing in their masks continuously. If it was, in fact, an error that Maintenance disabled not only the latching function but also the entire interphone PTT function of both yoke switches on that aircraft, then it may well be an error that has been repeated on multiple aircraft. Recommend that steps be taken to determine if this is, in fact, occurring when ASPs are upgraded and, if so, to re-enable the interphone PTT function of the yoke switches.				B737-700 Captain reported possible maintenance non-compliance with MEL application to inoperative yoke PTT switches.

The route, however, did autoload. Strange equipment notifications [enroute] prompted a call to Dispatch concerning whether or not the aircraft was reporting its position; it wasn't. I now had a slight doubtful feeling concerning system functionality. ZZZ Airport was reporting approximately 400/1 mist/drizzle. We briefed ILS PRM XL approach. All checklists were accomplished well in advance of approach and we were descending in level change mode when we were cleared for the ILS. I tried to accomplish the [company directed mental reminder procedure or 'mnemonic'] 'down to the line' (to assure appropriate Lateral/Altitude/Vertical Navigation Mode/Speed intervention configurations) but we were below 4,000 FT and when I tried to do so this VNAV didn't engage.  We both looked at the approach and noted that VNAV wouldn't work since the intermediate fix (prior to ZZZZZ Intersection) had an altitude of 4,000 FT which we were already below. I then selected APP, we both acknowledged approach mode and I saw the white glideslope armed [indication], we had previously intercepted the LOC [to satisfy] the 'Lateral Nav' portion of the mnemonic procedure. Approaching ZZZZZ Intersection something didn't feel right and I started re-checking/cross checking the MCP when the 'LOW Altitude' alert was issued by ATC. We accomplished a missed approach at this point. The next approach went just fine.	The First Officer advised he now believes the FMS anomalies addressed in the beginning of his report were not a factor in the eventual CFTT event although, at the time of the event, they had cast a pall of mental skepticism that compounded efforts to understand what was taking place when certain modes failed to engage as expected. He believed the mental distractions were complicit in his failure to scan raw data that would have illuminated their predicament.The reporter expanded on his comments regarding the company SOP mnemonic utilized to insure autoflight compliance with the lateral and vertical paths, airspeed and altitude constraints of an IAP. In particular, in this instance, to assure compliance with step down fixes prior to glideslope intercept using VNAV. Specifically the mnemonic requires the flight crew to assure: Lateral track compliance armed or active via VOR/LOC; altitude alert initially set to field elevation +100 FT to allow VNAV to comply with any procedural altitude restrictions prior to the FAF/glipeslope intercept altitude (but is subsequently reset to the MAP altitude at glideslope intercept/FAF passing); the appropriate vertical nav (VNAV) mode is engaged, and; airspeed window is set per aircraft configuration and vertical path mode.The reporter clarified that the approach clearance from ATC was 'cleared for the ILS approach, descend and maintain 3,000 FT until established.' At that point, 3,000 FT was selected in the altitude alert window, VOR/LOC was armed and, shortly, went active. Shortly after LOC was active they reset the altitude alert to field elevation +100 FT per the mnemonic.At the time FE+100 was set 4.5NM from ZZZZZ Intersection, the glideslope intercept fix, was the active waypoint and had a published and programmed crossing restriction of 4,000 MSL. When the First Officer attempted to engage VNAV, however, they were already below 4,000 FT on their way to their cleared altitude of 3,000 FT MSL, thus VNAV would not engage and the FMS vertical mode remained in LVL CHG and, as previously configured, the jet obediently continued its descent toward field elevation +100 FT with the throttles at idle.The reporter, when he started not 'feeling' right and was reviewing the MCP (Mode Control Panel), also noted the full scale low deflection of the raw data glideslope signal and concurrent with the Low Altitude Alert warning from ATC initiated the go-around.	The flight was an all nighter. The weather approximately 400/1, drizzle and mist. The approach was properly briefed, and all checklists complied with. I was the pilot not flying, the First Officer was the pilot flying. The First Officer had selected 'Level Change' while descending.When cleared for the approach, he accomplished [the SOP mental reminder mnemonic], but VNAV would not engage when selected. Approach mode was then selected although, looking back at it, the switch was not illuminated (the illumination turns off when the approach mode engages). When I switched to Tower at ZZZZZ Intersection, we were told they had a low altitude alert. Not immediately seeing the problem, we elected to go-around. Looking at the flight director, both needles were centered. I simply had not looked at how the approach had been set up on the MCP close enough. The First Officer later told me that the level change mode had remained selected, which explains why everything was centered and the aircraft was dutifully descending to the selected altitude of field elevation per the [mnemonic] check. We executed a missed approach, and the next approach was perfect.This is the first red-eye I had flown. While I do not wish to say I was fatigued, I definitely had been without sleep for close to 24 hours. I simply could not get to sleep during the day, and had been up since about XA:30 AM EDT. Sleeping during the day seems to be difficult for me, and lack of sleep certainly had an impact on how well I was performing (or not performing) my duties as PM, although I did not feel at all sleepy at the time, nor did I feel fatigued. I will surely attempt to avoid all red-eyes in the future.One thing I will include on all approaches in the future is a mental or verbal verification of the final approach fix crossing altitude at the time of crossing. I cannot believe we both missed something so obvious, but we did.		A B737NG being vectored for an ILS, failed to level at 3,000 FT until established, as cleared. When a low altitude alert sounded the Approach Controller, no longer able to contact the flight, promptly called the Tower who advised they had done, so and directed a go-around as the flight was passing 1,400-1,600 FT MSL (400-600 FT AGL) and continuing their descent while still one mile outside the FAF/glideslope intercept altitude of 2,900 FT MSL. Difficulty in utilizing a company directed memory aid intended to insure proper autoflight configuration and a resulting improperly set altitude alert at field elevation +100 FT likely contributed.

We were cleared on the LDORA RNAV STAR. DEN Approach cleared us to descend via LDORA 1 Runway 34L. Inside of the transition (about 15 miles from LARKS), we were given the PEEKK two Runway 16R and a clearance for direct to LARKS descending on the PEEKK 2 Runway 16R. The FMC would not let me execute the PEEKK Arrival and we were now descending for LARKS between FL190 and 17,000 FT per the LDORA Arrival. I told the Controller we needed a heading and altitude as we were having trouble loading the new arrival into the FMC. He told us to fly present heading and descend to 17,000 FT. We reloaded the transition into the FMC and it finally let us execute the PEEKK Arrival. We told ATC that we now had the arrival loaded and he re cleared us to LARKS and to descend on [via?] the PEEKK 2. It was as we were descending though 19,500 FT that I noticed that you must cross LARKS on the PEEKK Arrival between FL220 and FL200!  First, they have to get rid of some of the procedures at DEN. The names are hard to understand and hard to find in the book. Then they have to stop giving us very complicated changes so late in the procedure. (We are going 300 KTS 15 miles from a fix and they expect us to know what all the silly named fixes and procedures are!) That close inside of the transitions [the only acceptable change to a descend via clearance] should be 'FLY HEADING XXX, MAINTAIN XXX, THIS WILL BE RADAR VECTORS FOR RWY XX.'Another BIG gotcha is the different crossing altitudes at LARKS!!!!One more thing, DEN changes runways way too many times. I know--it's in the mountains and the wind shifts a lot (I used to fly into Stapleton); but they seem to do it unnecessarily a lot of times.		The Captain was the pilot flying and I was the pilot monitoring. We were given a descent to FL350 with discretion to FL270. Captain used Altitude Intervention to initiate the descent. At the time, we were on the LDORA 1 Arrival into Denver. While in the descent, Denver Center changed our arrival to the PEEKK 2. The clearance was 'cleared direct to larks and the PEEKK 2 Arrival to Denver.'' The Captain, being the pilot flying, went about changing the arrival in the FMC and I started to get out the new arrival. He selected direct to LARKS and executed the selection, doing this, however, while the LDORA was still active. After getting the PEEKK 2 Arrival out, I noticed the Captain having trouble getting the new arrival loaded into the FMC. I offered a few suggestions as the Captain grew frustrated. He then noticed that the seatbelt sign was still off and suggested I turn it back on. I said goodbye to the passengers and turned the seatbelt sign back on. When I returned from that duty, the Captain was still having trouble with FMC. I believe we were given discretion to FL200 and were handed off to Denver Approach. The PEEKK 2 was still not loaded into the FMC. The Captain told Approach we were having trouble with the FMC and asked for vectors. We were told fly present heading and maintain 17,000 FT. This was my first chance to load the arrival into the FMC and, just as soon as the Captain asked for vectors, I notified him that I had the arrival loaded. The Captain then told ATC that we had the arrival ready and we were told 'cleared to Denver via direct LARKS and the PEEKK 2 descend via the PEEKK 2.' The problem was that we were below FL200 at this point (I believe we were at FL194) and the crossing restriction at LARKS on the PEEKK 2 is between FL220 and FL200. We were five to ten miles from LARKS at this point and we climbed back to FL200, crossed LARKS, and then continued a normal descent and arrival via the PEEKK 2. I don't feel this altitude deviation is an issue because we were descending as cleared by Approach to 17,000 FT. When we were recleared to the PEEKK 2 Arrival and we corrected our altitude. ATC never asked about our altitude or said anything about an altitude problem or traffic. In fact, the crossing altitude for LARKS on the LDORA Arrival is between 17,000 FT and FL190 so terrain or traffic could be an issue. The Captain still felt we should file a safety report.		Confusion ensued when ATC changed the B737-700's clearance from 'descend via the LDORA RNAV STAR to land north' to 'proceed direct LARKS (a fix on both assigned STARS), recleared to descend via the PEEKK RNAV STAR to land south.'

Following an announcement to the passengers, we completed all checklists and began vectors for landing. Captain landed the aircraft.

We asked ATC for '10 right' to avoid the cell ahead. ATC's response was to standby. Cell depiction then turned to lightning bolt symbol. About 12 miles from cell, we contacted ATC again requesting 10 right for weather ahead. The ATC response again was to standby. Five prior to cell, ATC contacted us and asked what we wanted. We advised we were turning right to avoid cell ahead. ATC Controller then told us we were violating our clearance and wanted to know what emergency we were declaring. We advised we were turning for weather and ATC Controller then launched into a dialogue about how he was too busy directing traffic to deal with us and how we needed to declare an emergency if we wanted to deviate from his clearance, etc. Basically, instead of providing assistance and doing his job, the Controller appeared to be seeking conflict with us. I do not believe any violation of regulations occurred. This report is being provided based upon the recommendation from the Company ATC Specialist.		We were enroute and I was the pilot flying. We were flying in an area with scattered very large air mass thunderstorms. Some storms exceeded over 50,000 FT and were still building. We had been deviating for the last 200 NM over the front range of the Rockies. We could see thunderstorms rapidly building around and in front of us. Several times during the flight we were IMC and were flying around embedded thunderstorms. After navigating through a very large line of thunderstorms, we were able to proceed direct [to] an intersection on the RNAV arrival. Many aircraft were deviating around the storms too. We had been at FL360 and ATC descended us to FL320. We entered a layer and became IMC. We were approaching a thunderstorm cell [that] was building 20 NM in front of us. I asked the Captain, who was the pilot not flying, what he thought and we both agreed we should deviate around the storm to the north because there was large storms to the south. The Captain made three attempts to contact Center. The thunderstorm was rapidly building and was now above our altitude. We estimated the top of this storm to be above 42,000 FT. We received a lightning symbol over the storm and a magenta core had developed indicating a severe storm. The Captain attempted to contact Center again and received no response. I made the decision to deviate 10 degrees to the north. The thunderstorm had built so rapidly that I had to turn further 20 degrees to avoid contact with the storm. The Captain finally was able to establish contact with Center to tell him we were deviating to the north. The Controller became very irate and asked us if we were declaring an emergency. We told him no. Center angrily told us we had 'no right to deviate' from our clearance and demanded us to declare an emergency. The Captain and I were perplexed at the reaction of this Air Traffic Controller. The Center Controller began his tirade to us that he was busy coordinating a RJ and another 737 around thunderstorms and he was 'doing his job' and demanded that we declare an emergency. The Captain professionally told the Center Controller that he was exercising his authority for the safety of the flight to deviate around this severe thunderstorm and we were now proceeding direct to cleared intersection. We only deviated five NM to the north of this thunderstorm and the only closest aircraft was another carrier's flight 20 NM behind us at our altitude and they needed to deviate too. After landing, the Captain contacted Dispatch and spoke with the Supervisor about the incident and then spoke with a Company ATC Representative. The Company ATC Representative told us we did not violate any FAR's and recommended we both submit a report.		A B737-800 crew diverted around a fast building, severe thunderstorm without clearance because ATC failed to answer their request in a timely manner but the Controller objected to their action because no emergency was declared.

The First Officer then noticed that the C5 Bat Bus Sect 2 circuit breaker was popped on the P-6-5 Standby Power Control Unit and that the illumination of the Standby Power light may have been coincident with his retrieving his personal bag from the area in front of the P-6- 5 panel and possibly inadvertently pulling it out. We contacted Dispatch and advised Maintenance of the situation but they did not want us to reset the circuit breaker and directed us to divert for repairs. We advised ATC that we were diverting and declaring a precautionary emergency since we did not know if the breaker had popped on its own and the Battery Bus appeared to be unpowered although there was no drain on the ships batteries. Maintenance replaced the Standby Power system and we continued the flight without incident. It would be helpful if Maintenance Control had the ability to communicate to the flight crew the various systems that would be affected when a particular circuit breaker is open.

We were waiting for glide slope intercept. Passing the final approach fix, no glide slope, so we were now a bit high on approach. VMC conditions and we were late with Before Landing Checklist completion. At 500 FT, unstable for Before Landing checklist was called and the checklist was then completed. Normal touchdown and landing was then completed. We failed to pick out of the NOTAMS that the glide slope was out for XX. Also, the Captain was new on the airplane and it was the end of a long international flight. Better reading of the NOTAMS would have prevented us from waiting for the glide slope to show up.		We were cleared the visual with the ILS armed but did not get the glide slope at 2,500 FT MSL at the final approach fix. Descent was therefore started slightly late and with a substantial tailwind at altitude, descent rate required was more than usual (approx 1,200 FPM initially above 1,000 FT AGL then around 800-1,000 FPM below 1,000 FT AGL), the aircraft was approx 8-10 KTS fast approaching 500 FT AGL and the Before Landing checklist had not been called complete although all items had been accomplished and were at proper 'green' landing settings. As Pilot Monitoring, I made an 'unstable...checklist' call at 500 FT AGL and the approach was continued to landing once the checklist was immediately acknowledged to be complete. Landing was uneventful. It was later pointed out to me that the glide slope was NOTAMed out, which I missed during preflight planning. First, I should've noticed the XXR glide slope was OTS during my review of the NOTAMS. Second, as a crew we were late in calling to recognition that were no glide slope indications on the PFD although we had the localizer. If we had anticipated earlier in the flight that we would have to manually fly a visual glide slope we would have been prepared to start the descent right away and would not have required excess descent rate to recapture the PAPI. This, combined with a large tailwind on final, made the stable point come very quickly.		A First Officer and an International Captain, new to the B777, failed to see the destination glide slope out of service NOTAM and after the autoflight system did not capture a glide slope, the aircraft was high and unstabilized for the night landing.

At 36,500 FT, ATC instructed us to climb to FL380. The Captain told ATC we would have to climb and that we were descending to FL320. ATC then asked if we wanted FL360. The Captain said yes. ATC gave us FL360 and also stated we may have taken someone else's call.				Air Carrier initiated a descent but was questioned by ATC regarding a possible same company mix-up, i.e. the clearance was issued to a company flight.

We knew that this runway intersected Runway 22R and the airport was conducting arrivals to [Runway] 22R. We were cleared for takeoff and instructed don't delay so I advanced the throttles to spool the engines and waited for them to come up on power. We started rolling down [Runway] 14L and were approaching V1 when we heard the Tower tell an Airbus to go around. While we rolled through the intersection of the two runways I caught a glimpse of the Airbus at what appeared to be within 500 to 600 FT to our left and at approximately 150 FT above the ground, starting a go around. We reached V2 and rotated which per Tower's instruction would require a left turn to 120 heading. We discussed quickly how close that was to the Airbus. Once we reached 10,000 we again discussed just how close we came to the Airbus and we both discussed the departure instructions and had we failed or did anything correctly. As far as we know we complied with all instructions, we had informed Tower that we required full length [Runway] 14L due to weight and performance limitations. The airport was also operating [Runway] 14L takeoffs from intersection U2 but we were incapable of takeoff from that intersection. At the gate I did include in my departure brief that dispatch had asked me to call and discuss weather and departure procedures with them. Dispatch had called and requested that we be allowed full length for this runway and advised me of other than normal departure procedures and runway for the day. I have been involved in many intersection takeoffs and arrivals, but this is the closest I have ever come to another aircraft during intersection operations.

With the LOC captured the airplane also gave us GS* [glideslope acquire]. As the PF was setting Go Around Altitude, we both noticed the Glide Slope jump 1 dot above. The plane began to add power to climb to the Glide Slope. The PF selected a vertical descent of 300 to stop the Climb. The plane's peak altitude was 6,260 FT. We rearmed the glide path and proceeded on the approach. Initially we attributed this to a distance of 28 miles. Proceeding further down glide path we noticed descent rates of 200 to 1,400 FPM. We asked the Controller about any spurious glide slope reports for 16L. He initially responded that there were no reports of spurious glide path. The Controller came back a minute or so later to respond that Tower was crossing airplanes across the ILS critical area from 16L to 16C on the C taxiway. Makes sense. Suggest Tower write a NOTAM when they are doing simultaneous approaches with a scattered layer obscuring the airport advising us of a spurious glide path.		Although we had the instantaneous 'Dog looking at the TV stare.' Call outs were made by me the PM and action was taken by the PF the Captain. We were paying total attention to the situation and monitoring the approach on the final phase like we were supposed to do. Suggest Tower write a NOTAM when they are doing simultaneous approaches with a scattered layer obscuring the airport advising us of a spurious glide path.		A320 flight crew experiences an unstable glideslope during approach to Runway 16L at SEA. It is ultimately determined that the Tower is crossing aircraft to depart Runway 16C which is causing the instability.

We could not find any chart revisions in the on board binder to rectify the discrepancy. We verified the correct frequency of 110.95 through ATC and the FMC. Additionally, it should be noted, the localizer frequency for Runway 30L is 110.3. We were in VMC conditions performing a visual approach with ILS backup so it presented no issues; however, this may cause some confusion if a Crew is flying an ILS in IMC.				The flight crew of a B737NG discovered the commercially provided chart for the ILS Rwy 35 SA CAT I at MSP published an erroneous LOC frequency, 110.3, in the briefing portion of the page. The plan view of the approach, however, displays the correct frequency, 110.95. Worth of note, however, is that the identifier, IBMA, is correct in both locations and, thus, an alert flight crew could be expected to note the incorrect identifier had they tuned 110.3 per the briefing text.

After takeoff in the initial climb phase, the autopilot began in the LNAV mode to fly the published departure. Selected the autopilot between 500-1,000 FT, did normal flap schedule. During this process the EICAS displayed 'autopilot.' The First Officer was in the process of the after takeoff checklist and check in with ATC. We noticed the throttles had gone to the mechanical stops and speed began to exceed 250 KTS. The First Officer finally got to check in with the ATC departure and they requested us to slow to 250 KTS, which during this time, I selected speed intervention. The speed bug on the PFD was indicating 250 KTS. The speed window indicated 250 KTS when selected, but could not change the speed bug on the PFD in either direction. Continued to pull power back, but throttles kept going back to mechanical stop. Deselected autopilot, deselected autthrottles on the MCP, but also had to disconnect the autthrottles on the throttles before regaining control. Deselected F/D. Flew the departure manually for a short time and then reselected the F/D's on, autopilot on, autthrottles on and the aircraft seemed to be normal. EICAS advisory 'autopilot' went away. Autopilot automation failed to comply with airspeed. Next time I get an EICAS 'autopilot' advisory I will immediately disconnect all automation.		During these few seconds of trying to regain control of the automation, because we were in near-level flight and because the throttles were advancing to near full power, airspeed accelerated past the 250 KTS bug to 300 KTS in only 3-4 seconds. Captain turned off all automation very quickly, and slowed aircraft back to required 250 KTS speed. While we were above 250 KTS, approximately 15-20 seconds, ATC called to tell us he needed us to be at 250 KTS.		A B777 autothrottle system malfunctioned as the EICAS alerted AUTOPILOT with an audible warning. The aircraft accelerated beyond 250 KTS toward 300 KTS, which required disconnecting all autothrottle automation to regain control.

ATC said they would check on the request. They told us then to descend on the PXN 3 Arrival. They then asked if we were doing the BUSHY transition.  BUSHY is on the PXN 3 Arrival prior to SUNOL so we said yes (no mention of any clearance on the RNAV Z 29).  We then switched controllers and they again asked us if we were on the BUSHY transition.  We said yes.  They cleared us for the visual and we responded, 'Are we cleared for the visual RNAV Z 29?' and then they said 'Cleared RNAV Z 29.'   At this point, we were past BUSHY and almost to SUNOL and they said, 'Oh, I thought you were on the BUSHY transition' and we said, 'We were never really cleared the RNAV Z.'  They said 'no problem' and they gave us a short vector for traffic and cleared us for the visual. ATC needed to clarify the Approach instead of assuming.  And, we needed to also clarify and ask when there are misunderstandings.		BUSHY is not a transition and should never have been referred to as such. It is an initial approach fix. The term transition refers to a point on a STAR from which an approach can start and it is published on the STAR. All LAX STARs and approaches are a good points of reference. When clearing an aircraft for an approach say, 'Proceed direct BUSHY. At BUSHY cleared the RNAV Z 29.' Revise the PANOCHE Three Arrival to indicate BUSHY as a transition point! Never issue partial or vague clearances. Never ask an aircraft to fly a transition that is not published on the STAR! Instead, say 'Proceed direct BUSHY. At BUSHY cleared the RNAV Z 29.'		A B737 crew on the OAK PNX 3 Arrival was cleared via the RNAV Z 29 but did not begin the approach at BUSHY because they did not believe that the BUSHY IAF should be termed a transition from the arrival.

We continued the takeoff roll and rotation with nearly immediate compressor stalls/surges coming from the engine. Tower reported smoke and flames coming from the left engine within the first several hundred feet of flight. I swapped controls with the Captain when safely airborne at approximately 1,000 AGL, cleaned up the aircraft, and executed the Engine Fire/Severe Damage/Separation/Seizure Checklist immediate action items. At no time did we have any associated warning/caution lights or warning horn and the engine kept running with nearly symmetrical power until we shut the engine down in accordance with the checklist. After accomplishing the engine shutdown, I declared an emergency with Tower, was given a block altitude, and we leveled off at approximately 5,000 MSL and 210 KTS and stayed up Tower frequency receiving radar vectors to remain within Tower airspace while accomplishing the rest of the checklist. Once completed, we swapped controls while the Captain explained the situation to the flight attendants as well as made a PA to the passengers. We then re-swapped controls and executed the One-Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist, calculated Flaps 15 single-engine landing data, reviewed the approach and go-around procedure, and set-up and executed a fairly uneventful single-engine approach and landing. Fire and rescue personnel met us on the runway and told us the engine looked safe to taxi to the gate. We then reviewed brake cooling data, with no special procedures required, and taxied uneventfully to the gate to offload the passengers and secure the aircraft. I discussed the incident with the Airfield Operations representative after we returned to the gate and he said they are constantly battling to keep the migrating Snow Geese clear of the runway environment on the airfield. Potentially this event will lead to increased awareness and funding for the BASH Program and they will have sufficient manning and equipment to increase bird detection capability and reduce the likelihood of bird strikes in the future.		The First Officer was the pilot flying. It was daylight, hazy, with good visibility. I used the HUD for takeoff. V1 was 120, VR was 132, and V2 was 136. Almost simultaneously with the V1 call during the takeoff, I saw large birds about halfway down the runway just as the First Officer verbalized that he saw birds. I saw between six and ten birds, later identified as Canadian geese, sitting near the runway centerline, mostly on the Captain's (left) side. The geese were not visible from the departure end due to a crowned runway. We saw the geese approximately 150 yards prior to impact. I was very concerned about ingesting multiple birds in at least one engine, and I continued to watch them until we hit them. The geese remained sitting on the runway until we were almost on top of them, when two or three flew up and towards the Captain's side of the runway. This distraction caused me to not make the rotate call. At very close to rotate speed, I felt multiple impacts with the plane's left side, followed immediately by loud, continuous compressor stalls, and accompanied by erratic engine indications on the number one engine. The First Officer continued the takeoff and began a climb. I assumed control of the aircraft at approximately 100 FT AGL, by saying 'I have the aircraft.' A few seconds later the Tower Controller advised us that we had smoke and flames coming from the left engine. There were no fire or overheat indications in the cockpit. At approximately 400 FT above the ground, reverting back to 20 years of PT's and PC's, I attempted to call for the exact right checklist name, but stumbled on the exact verbiage when calling for the memory items associated with the 'Engine Fire, Severe Damage, Separation.' I eventually said something like 'Engine Fire Memory Items,' and the First Officer responded appropriately. We completed the appropriate memory items and checklist, and the number one engine was successfully shutdown. We used the Challenge, Response, Response procedure for this portion of the checklist. While guarding the number two throttle for the shutdown procedure, I realized that we had accomplished a reduced thrust takeoff, and had more power available. I pushed the throttle almost all the way up and noticed a slight increase in our climb rate, but we were still climbing at only about 300 FT per minute, which is less than a normal simulator profile. I then noticed the gear was still down, so I called for Landing Gear Up right after we completed the memory items a few seconds later. I am fairly certain that we did not raise the landing gear due to the distraction caused by the quick transfer of aircraft control just after takeoff. After retracting the flaps, we declared an emergency with the Tower Controller and requested assistance from the Fire Department upon landing. We asked the Tower Controller to vector us away from terrain and close to the airport as we would be returning after accomplishing the appropriate checklists. We were cleared to 4,000 FT MSL. I connected the A autopilot shortly after retracting the flaps, and it did a good job of holding heading and making turns to heading. I had selected 210 as a climb speed, and I believe we were in Level-Change, but I am not certain. I then averted more of my attention to the checklist being accomplished. Sometime later, I noticed that we were passing 4,500 FT MSL, and the Controller subsequently cleared us to 5,000 FT. Even though I felt like I was doing a good job of monitoring power and airspeed, I failed to notice that the autopilot did not capture the altitude set in the MCP, nor do I know why it did not capture. After leveling at 5,000 FT, I switched from the A autopilot to B autopilot. I needed to do a better of job of accomplishing a complete instrument cross check whole dividing my attention between Challenge, Response, Response, and flying the airplane. After completing the checklist up to the Descent portion, with the plane in level flight with the autopilot connected, I transferred control to the First Officer. After contacting the flight attendants via interphone, they confirmed there was no longer smoke or fire coming from the number one engine. I briefed the flight attendants about what happened and what our plan was. I then briefed the customers with similar information, and asked them to follow the flight attendants' instructions explicitly. After accomplishing the Descent Checklist, we were cleared for a visual approach from a position nine miles northeast of the airport at 5,000 FT. We configured with landing gear and Flaps 15. We were slightly high intercepting final, so we elected to fly through final and turn back to the left to re-intercept final. At 1,000 FT AGL we were on glideslope with a sink rate of 800 FPM, 11 KTS above target speed. At 800 FT AGL, we were on glide slope and within a few KTS of target speed, with approach power set. We made an uneventful landing using thrust reversers and autobrakes too. We stopped on the runway and the First Officer communicated with the Fire Department personnel via radio. The Fire Department spokesman confirmed no evidence of smoke or fire, or significant structural damage. We taxied to the gate on one engine and deplaned the Customers using normal procedures. After arrival at the gate, I completed a form for the Airport Fire Department, and communicated via telephone with Company Dispatch, Maintenance Control, and Air Traffic Control. Notes:1. The First Officer performed excellently during the most critical phase of this emergency. He recognized the birds as a hazard, verbalized it, continued the takeoff without a rotate call almost simultaneous to impact, and did an outstanding job accomplishing the memory items for the engine fire and failure.2. Given the number and location of the geese, we were lucky to not have birds fail both engines. If I could think more quickly, we would have maneuvered the aircraft towards the right side of the runway for two reasons -we would have increased our distance from the birds, and we would have placed the fuselage between the birds and the number two engine.3. The compressor stalls were much louder than in the simulator, and they were very distracting. I forced myself to ignore the sound. 4. I wasted a few precious seconds stumbling over the exact right checklist name. Why can't we just call it the Emergency Engine Shutdown Checklist? We can still apply the checklist in the event of an 'engine fire, severe damage, separation, or seizure,' but it is not necessary to repeat all the reasons to accomplish a checklist in the checklist name. After experiencing this particular emergency, recalling and reciting this overly verbose checklist name is a waste of time and mental energy, and compromises safety at a critical time.5. I believe our simulator training adequately prepared me to handle this emergency. 6. In the simulator, I cannot ever remember a reject decision scenario where there was a hazard (birds, vehicle) far down the runway that required us to make a difficult decision about continuing. In the simulator, we almost always know a failure is coming, and that it will happen soon after V-1. I suggest that scenarios similar to what I have described in this report be incorporated into our simulator training.7. In my opinion, the flight attendants, despite performing superbly, were fairly shook up after the customers had deplaned. Immediately after the flight, Scheduling wanted to deadhead all six crew members back to base, which would have involved two legs on full airplanes, a plane change, and eight hours of traveling. That's a lot to ask of people who might experience a delayed emotional reaction to their emergency event. The Company should provide a variety of options for crew members after a serious emergency, and leave it to each individual crew member to decide which option to choose.8. The ATC Tower Controller did an excellent job with communications and vectoring.		B737 flight crew reports ingesting a goose at V1 during takeoff with the First Officer flying. Loud compressor stalls are heard from the left engine and the Captain assumes control at approximately 100 FT AGL but the positive rate call is not made and the gear is not retracted. After the engine is shut down the gear is noticed and retracted. Flight returns for a single engine landing.

We were in the weather and had the engine anti-ice switches on. Passing 18,000 FT, I called for the Descent Checklist. As we accomplished the checklist, my First Officer said, 'Whoa look at your airspeed.' I looked down as we got a buffet alert on the FMC and an aural airspeed low warning and saw about 120. I disengaged all automation, but continued to comply with the RNAV ground track and altitude restrictions. My First Officer then made a great call, 'My airspeed's fine indicating 250 KTS.' About that time, we had a Master Caution light and noted that both EECs had gone into the soft alternate mode. We followed the QRH and, when we put the EECs into the hard alternate mode, my correct airspeed indications came back. The rest of the flight was uneventful. When we landed, Maintenance found an ADIRU fault in both engines and grounded the aircraft. I think crews need to know that this could possibly happen with incorrect data inputs to the engines. The airspeed low warning definitely got my attention, but good pilot not flying skills by my First Officer allowed us to properly handle the problem quickly. We initially thought something might have iced up in the weather, but the anti-ice was on and Maintenance told us the faulty airspeed indication was due to the EEC problem. The issue was loss of accurate airspeed indication on Captain's side.	The reporter stated that they were descending through about 18,000 FT when he called for the Descent Checklist and at about the same time as the aircraft entered the cloud tops. The OAT was between 0C and +10C so they had turned the engine anti-ice on when the First Officer made his comment about the Captain's airspeed. The clouds were only about 4,000 FT to 5,000 FT thick and when they popped out of the clouds his airspeed recovered immediately. The increase was not gradual, it was instantaneous. The comment in his report about the weather being an issue was what he thought about first when the event began. The fact that Maintenance found a fault code on both ADIRU's with no other indications is rather strange. The reporter stated, the fault codes which Maintenance reported indicated that the aircraft was not dispatchable until further maintenance was performed.			A B737-800 had a dual ADIRU fault in icing conditions during descent which resulted in both engine EEC's reverting to the Soft Mode and the Captain's airspeed falling to about 120 KTS with a buffet alert and aural low speed warning.

All indications on the NAV displays were normal for the procedure. As aircraft made the left turn at SAM fix Approach Control assigned us a 090 heading. Additionally they inquired as to which arrival we were assigned and flying. The rest of the arrival was vectors transitioning to ILS Runway 29 which was completed successfully. During taxi in we were instructed to call Approach Control on a land line. After a discussion along the lines of 'all of our company jets were not flying the correct procedural ground track' we concluded the conversation with an agreement to contact Company Sandards to investigate the matter.	The reporter advised that, during the land line call to Approach Control, limited common language skills made it impossible for him to determine exactly where their flight path deviated from where ATC expected them to go. He stated the moving map display coincided perfectly with the charted arrival which indicated to him that, if their track differed from ATC's expectation, the error was programmed into both.The reporter further addressed his concern about having no raw data means by which to confirm the digitally derived track the FMS slavishly follows coincides with the intended real life track over the ground. He referenced his many years of flying from point to point based on land based NAV fixes that did provide such independent assessment of the aircraft's real location with respect to the earth's surface.			A B777-200 Captain was advised by VIDP Approach Control that his lateral track did not conform to the SAM 6F RNAV STAR by which they had been cleared. The reporter, however, disagreed-citing their FMS track was precisely following the FMS magenta line which, in turn, exactly matched the route described on their commercially published aero chart.

There was also a thunderstorm near the holding fix which we flew into. I was the non-flying pilot and was task saturated trying to get the weather for our alternate and QRO, so we could decide where to divert. I didn't know the ICAO identifiers to get the weather which made the whole process quite difficult. We decided to go to our alternate. We were given a fix to go to along with the routing and given a climb to FL240, our cruise altitude to our alternate. Neither of us heard the routing. So I called back to question it. I put the first fix in the box but did not but did not execute it because I was unsure of the routing. I told the Captain it was in the box but not executed and pointed to the fix and the dashed line. It appeared that he was on the way in heading select so I went back to getting the weather and routing. I was heads-down. ATC then asked where we were going. I looked up, saw that we were in a right turn level at 15,000. The fix we were cleared to was to our left requiring a left turn. I pointed to the fix on the PFD and told the Captain that's where we need to go, turn left. He said he knew that and needed the weather. I went back to getting the weather after I thought things were being corrected. Then with panic in his voice, ATC questioned us again as to why we were still turning right. He gave us a heading to 270, but we were still in a right turn. I said we are turning right, we need to turn left. The reply was, I know. I said we are turning right go left...no reply, so I took control of the airplane by turning off the autopilot and turning to the 270 heading. The speed-bug was set at 200 KTS and we were not climbing so I spun the bug to 250 and hit N1 for the climb. At this point, we came out of the clouds and I saw another plane off to our right and about 1,000 FT higher. It was never a factor but I'm assuming the cause for the concern on ATC's part. Once we were pointing in the right direction and climbing, the Captain took the airplane back but could not get any of the automation to work. The autopilot wouldn't turn on, the command bars were gone, and none of the automation was working correctly. I could see that the Captain was getting wrapped up in the automation again while hand-flying. I told him to fly the plane and I would figure it out. Once it got figured out, the autopilot was engaged and we proceeded to our alternate for an uneventful landing.There were a couple things that went wrong. First, I was heads-down getting weather when that wasn't important at that moment. Second, there was a breakdown in the automation and situational awareness. Discussing this at length with the Captain, we determined that the first fix was not executed. So the holding pattern was still active. The initial turn to the fix was done via heading select. When LNAV was selected, the plane turned right to recapture the holding track. I didn't see any of that as I was heads down. There was weather, terrain, communication trouble, automation trouble/confusion, and lack of correctly prioritizing tasks. There was a lot going on all at the same time.		While holding at SMO waiting for weather to improve at our destination we decided to divert to our alternate. I was flying the aircraft as Captain. We were cleared out of the holding pattern to a fix then jet route to our alternate. Initially I selected a heading to the cleared fix and the aircraft began to turn in that direction. The new fix was inserted on 1L of the FMC but not executed. LNAV was selected and the plane turned to re-intercept the holding pattern. The autopilot was disconnected and the plane was manually returned to the correct course. No loss of separation occurred and the flight proceeded to our alternate without incident.Maintain better situation awareness especially in high threat airports and confirm the automation is doing what it is supposed to.		A B737-800 Captain failed to turn right on an initial heading to their alternate after exiting holding so the First Officer took control in repose to ATC's concern about the wrong direction toward traffic.

The planned route to RJAA was 180 minutes ETOPS, pretty far south, crossing 40N140W 41N150W 42N160W 43N170W 42N180E 40N170E.  Event began at FL350 cruise about 2 hours into the flight. During a restroom break for the flying pilots the Captain went out and the Flight Attendant who came into the cockpit engaged me in conversation.  The conversation topics varied, then with no concern expressed, he told me about the strong smell near Door 2L during pre-flight boarding which he thought had been coming from the jetway.  He had not noticed the smell in flight.  The Captain returned shortly and we discussed the Flight Attendant's comments, and as I also needed a restroom break, [I] offered to go by the Door 2L to see if the smell was still there.  While standing in front of Door 2L nothing was noticeable, but standing facing the inflight entertainment workstation 'kiosk' I could smell hot/burning plastic.  I opened the twin small doors (about 4'x7' each) and could see the previously replaced cabin printer.  With the doors open, the smell was pretty strong, but no smoke.  Nothing was hot to the touch, the printer itself was very warm, and the back of the IFE and other switches were warm.  I reported to the Captain via intercom, and then woke the augmenting pilot from his rest seat, asking him to check the area also.  Our augmenting pilot, along with our deadhead Captain, went to investigate further while I returned to the cockpit.  The augmenting pilot called to the Captain and said they smelled the same fumes from the printer area, the printer seemed unusually warm, and [they] had turned off what they believed to be the printer power.  The Captain by now was involved in a SATVOICE call to Dispatch and Maintenance.  We began to work through the Fumes Irregular checklist, including turning off inflight entertainment (IFE) power and seat power outlets, both switches being located at the Door 2L IFE kiosk, as well as recirculation fans and gasper fans.  We were still flying directly away from our nearest suitable airport [the departure airport] and no other airport coming into range for quite a bit of time.  The augmenting pilot informed us the printer not quite as warm as before, the fumes were still present, but the fumes seemed less strong. The augmenting pilot returned to the cockpit as we discussed our options with Dispatch.  Although the condition seemed that it may be resolving, we were left with the fact that there was a previous maintenance repair that was unsuccessful, the smell was still there, plus every 1 minute down track was 2 minutes further from landing.  The Captain decided to return to [departure airport] and informed Dispatch. We began with a FMC ROUTES page offset of 15nm right, sent an ADS emergency message, and made a PAN PAN call on guard for our PACOTS Track-E traffic. As the offset progressed we changed altitude from FL350 to FL345, executed DIVERT [departure airport] via the FMC ALTERNATES page, and completed the turn to [departure airport].  During all this we received a response 'CONFIRM' to our ADS emergency.  I initially replied with ADS text requesting direct [departure airport] and CPDLC ROUTE request.  Our augmenting pilot quickly pointed out we could call [Center] OCEANIC via SATVOICE.  The call was made, and we were able to clarify with ATC our current position, altitude and track.  I inquired if ATC needed any intermediate waypoints, but our clearance remained direct [departure airport] with block FL340-350.  Several aircraft responded to our 'PAN PAN' call via VHF radio.  Position reporting along our 2-1/2 hour return was not quite as expected.  Although we had installed FMC LEGS page crossing at 140W (4045N140W) and 130W (3920N130W), they did not automatically report to Company, and we had little confidence they were CPDLC reporting to ATC.  One minute after the 140W waypoint, we noted the POS page had not reported, so we used the send prompt at POS REPORT 6R.  We also sent a CPDLC POSITION report at this time.  A couple of minutes later, Dispatch requested our 140W report. We finally sent via COMPANY-COM DISPATCH free text.				B777-200 First Officer reported Flight Attendant noticed a smell of smoke about two hours into a transoceanic flight, so they declared an emergency and returned to departure airport.

I armed the localizer, which would have allowed everything to work out just fine. But, since we were 25 NM out, I thought it would have been better to capture the course in NAV mode. After I did that, the FMGC showed no NAV intercept. Then, I attempted to correct the problem by selecting Direct to a fix on the approach. Finally, I just rearmed the localizer and turned in with the heading bug to intercept the course. By then we were flying through the localizer. I clicked off the autopilot and turned in manually toward the course. The Captain grabbed his control side-stick to turn in more aggressively to re-intercept the localizer because we had gone far enough through that we approached the center line for [a parallel runway]. The whole time this was going on, I never looked outside to get a better situational awareness. We finally got back on the localizer for a stabilized approach. I have not been sleeping well. That is why I was tired prior to the start of the duty period. Furthermore, my marriage has not been going well. That is why I froze up for a couple of seconds and did not take the right action when it needed to be taken.  If I had only armed the localized and left it alone and used heading on the FCU to turn inward a mile before intercept, then none of this would have happened. This was due to a combination of over-thinking something and then being to slow to react when it went wrong.				A320 First Officer reported a course deviation on ILS arrival that was caused at least in part by fatigue and personal problems.

First Officer (PF) assumed manual (un-flight-directed) control and leveled aircraft at 4,000 FT. Tried to cycle F/Ds with no joy. Communicated with ATC 'unable PRM.' Vectored south, then west, then north over the top of airport at 5,000 FT on vectors for basic ILS to Runway 26R. During vectors attempted to regain FDs and/or A/Ps. During troubleshooting, crew noted heading bug on First Officer's PFD frozen on 090 degree heading and would not respond to changes made to heading on MCP. In addition, First Officer's PFD displayed commanded airspeed was frozen at 230 KTS and would not respond to changes made to airspeed on MCP. During ATC assigned climb from 4,000 FT to 5,000 FT MCP altitude window reset itself to 50,000 FT several times, requiring multiple resets back to 5,000 FT. Noted Captain heading bug and airspeed responding normally to MCP inputs. First Officer did outstanding job of hand flying aircraft through multiple, compound malfunction environment, during high workload in high density ATC environment. Control of aircraft transferred to Captain. Reengaged both FDs, with Captain as master, and reengaged A/P A. Flew rest of approach with A/P A to visual approach passing 1,500 FT AGL. First Officer's FD command bars redisplayed as landing gear was lowered and flaps were selected to 15. Suspect some combination of FCC B and/or MCP failure. This would be an excellent scenario for recurrent training this year with our current emphasis on automation download and hand flying skill maintenance. Would need to see maintenance action regarding this malfunction and corrective action before recommending preventive measures or further corrective action.				B737-800 Captain reported multiple autoflight anomalies on approach, perhaps related to FCC failure.

My First Officer noted that a parachute jumper was off the right side of the aircraft. I looked to the right to see if I could see them when I noted another jumper on the right front side of the aircraft. This jumper was clearly doing some evasive maneuvers to avoid us. The second jumper which I believe was a tandem jump passed down the right side of the aircraft about 150 FT away. I asked the Controller if he was aware of the jumpers. He said that the jump plane was being worked by a high side Controller. He then told us that the jumpers were not cleared to jump. He said that the higher Controller was holding the jumpers until we cleared the area. There was nothing on the ATIS referencing jumper in the area and there were no NOTAMS for jumpers. I called Dispatch on the ground and spoke to both the Dispatcher and a Station Director to make them aware of the event. ATC needs to stop vectoring us through jump zones when jumping is about to take place. If there is a jump plane in the air, we need to be vectored to stay clear. From the time a jump plane takes off until it has landed, that jump zone needs to be protected, just like airspace is protected for an aircraft on an approach into an uncontrolled airport. ATC protects the airspace until that aircraft reports on the ground.		On descent via a published arrival, we were level at 4,000 FT on a 240 degree heading when we passed two parachutes off our right wing. I was the First Officer pilot flying when I saw the first parachute pass 300-400 FT off our right wing co-altitude. The Captain then identified a second parachute, apparently maneuvering defensively to avoid us, pass 200-300 FT off our right wing, co-altitude. The Captain, as pilot monitoring, asked Approach Control if they were aware of jumping activity in our area. ATC advised that jumpers were, 'supposed to wait until you were clear.' The rest of approach and landing were uneventful.		The Air Carrier flight crew observed several parachutes in close proximity during approach to a major metropolitan airport. When they inquired with ATC, they received the response that the jumpers had not been cleared to jump.

Set up MAX Power Takeoff for Precautionary Profile due to W/S Advisory in ATIS.  Long line of aircraft for runway.  Shut down Number 1 Engine while waiting for departure corridor to open.  Restarted Number 1 when flights started moving again.  Number 1 had been stabilized for 10 minutes before taxi into lineup and wait.  Captain appeared to do good job centering aircraft nose on runway centerline.  Given takeoff clearance, Captain ran engines up to 40%, depressed TOGA, engines growled and nose immediately yawed to the right.  Captain appeared to counter with tiller.  Encountered major 'chattering' as nose continued to veer off, and then Captain immediately pulled throttles to idle while nose started to come back to the left and once again parallel Runway centerline.  We stopped parallel to Runway centerline, offset by about 10-12' and what seemed to be 50-75' down the runway.  We agreed our takeoff attempt was over and elected to exit the runway at closest intersection.  Whole event lasted just a few seconds; probably never got faster than 10 knots.  Another carrier Airbus at hold short said over Tower frequency that smoke came from nose wheel during the event.  We taxied off runway, faced west and held our position for a few minutes while we assessed the situation.  We agreed to taxi back to gate slowly and have Maintenance take a look.  Coordinated with Operations to effect plan, and Captain assessed nose wheel steering on the way back, fully prepared to stop immediately if need be.  Aircraft was pulled from service.  After talking with Company Safety the next day, they believed it to be a nose wheel steering hydraulic metering valve issue, which caused the nose wheel to remain cocked out of commanded position. Check the engines/EEC's to make sure it was not an engine issue.  Then have the nose wheel steering hydraulic cylinder from the event aircraft evaluated.  It was such an out-of-the-norm event following textbook execution of normal procedures that there isn't anything I can think of to prevent it.				A B737-700 nose wheel steering metering valve apparently malfunctioned as takeoff thrust was set which caused the aircraft to veer off centerline and resulted in a low speed rejected takeoff.

As we began the descent, VNAV would not engage. I tried to enter a lower altitude so the VNAV would engage. The altitude I entered into the FMC was FL300. I thought we were all set and the descent was occurring. I later noticed we had climbed from about FL276 to FL300. We were supposed to be descending to FL240. After I noticed the aircraft level off at FL300, I immediately used Vertical Speed (V/S) to continue the descent. ATC did not notify us of the possible deviation. I think we should have monitored our FMC entries better. This would have prevented what occurred.				After experiencing some difficulty programming a clearance to descend to FL240 the Captain of a B737-700 realized that, instead of descending, the aircraft had climbed from approximately FL276 to FL300 where it had leveled.

We planned on being at 3,800 MSL at that point for the approach. During our briefing we discussed the terrain west of the airport and noted the illusion due to the sloping terrain. This is not a usual runway for landing and I've only used it two times before in previous years.The KEPEC arrival is intended to be used for runways 25L and 25R arrivals and [published crossing] altitudes are high as expected for the terrain in the area. LAS approach cleared us down to 7,200 and for a visual approach to Runway 7R. As we neared the airport we were asked if we had the field in sight and responded 'yes' as the city and airport are easy to identify due to the bright lights. It was almost dark. We were around 15 miles from the airport when we were cleared for the visual approach to Runway 7R; we were given a heading to intercept final which came pretty close the 5 NM final fix we had created. Our vertical navigation indicated a descent of around 1,300 FPM to reach our planned 3,800 at that point.We started our descent and soon thereafter ATC called us with a low altitude alert on their screen. We immediately leveled off, verified our position and verified with ATC that we did have the airport in sight. I was in terrain mode and knew of the terrain to the left west of our position and the terrain ahead was 'green' on the NAV display. We maintained altitude around 5,500 until assured of terrain clearance and continued the approach with out further ado. We were vectored below the altitudes on the KEPEC arrival. It was probably too dark to accept a visual that far from the airport. There is some high terrain to the southwest of LAS and descents should be made much closer to the airport and may require much greater rates of descent than normally used at other airports. It is very desolate to the southwest of LAS there are no lights of any kind no houses, no roads other than a highway and depth perception is lost; kind of like descending over a large body of water at night. The high overcast probably made it much darker than normal.I would like to see a charted visual approach with recommended altitudes for times when LAS is using Runway 7; or, maybe, a maintain XXXX FT until XX DME from LAS. I realize that Runway 7R is almost never used but I would like to see some sort of guidance to make those approaches easier and safer especially after almost 12 hours on duty.				A B737-700 flight crew arriving LAS from the west as dusk was turning to night was cleared for a visual approach to Runway 7R. During their descent they received a low altitude alert from ATC as they crossed terrain as high as 8,600 MSL.

Apparently, she had been burned by hot water during the brewing process with the aft #2 coffee maker. The Captain immediately asked if she was alright and if she needed any medical assistance. He was told she was okay except for some burns. We all agreed that we could safely continue on our way to [our destination] and that she could continue her duties. Once on the ground, the Captain spoke to the injured Flight Attendant in the Aft Galley and she assured him that she was okay and willing to continue with her trip. She commented that she had lifted the handle on the coffee maker while it was brewing. In conversation with the Captain, we drew the conclusion that this action was an operational error and we believed it was the cause of the incident. We then departed and discussed the incident further. The Captain felt in the interest of safety it would be best to have the Station Maintenance change the coffee maker. Because of the situation, and the assumption that incident was operator error, no logbook entry was made before departing. After further conversation with the Captain, we realized that an error in judgment was made and a report should be filed. Follow company guidance and policy.		There was an incident in the cabin involving the 'B' Flight Attendant. Once on the ground, after passenger deplaning, I called Dispatch to advise them of the situation. When on the ground, I spoke to the injured Flight Attendant in the aft galley and she assured me she was okay to continue with her trip. In our conversation, she had told me that she lifted the handle of the coffee maker while it was brewing. That immediately made me think that there was 'operator error' involving this incident. My approach was more of a concern for her safety, but at the same time I believed her actions may have caused the incident. We left to go back to where we had departed from and, during cruise flight; I discussed the incident further with my First Officer. I then contemplated the possibility that it may 'not have been' operator error. I felt that in the interest of safety it would be best to have Maintenance check it out. Therefore, I elected to make an aircraft logbook entry stating that the aft #2 coffee maker was not brewing correctly. Maintenance at our destination changed the coffee maker because it had coffee grounds on it. My concern about this situation is that perhaps because of my assumption, that the incident was caused by operator error, I may have erred myself by not making a log entry and subsequent crew deferral before departing. It was not until after much contemplation that I realized that if I was in error, that I should file this report. In retrospect, I would elect to write-up and defer the coffee pot immediately. I believe we already have sound guidance by our Company in this area.		Two pilots report that a Flight Attendant sustained hot water burns when she lifted the handle on the aft #2 coffee maker during the brewing process on their B737-700 aircraft.

We were then handed over to ZAB and checked in. We were never cleared to 'descend via' the KOOLY RNAV Arrival. We noticed that we were getting high on the descent profile should we get cleared to descend via, so we asked ATC if we should expect a descend via clearance. He then cleared us to fly the arrival landing 25L transition but to descend to cross SQUEZ at 12,000, which is more restrictive than the published 12000A 15000B. We interpreted that as he needed that altitude at SQUEZ and, since we were high to begin with due to them not descending us on time, we increased our descent rate, so as to arrive at 12,000 as soon as possible. He slowed us to 250 during the descent and then told us to 'comply with the arrival speeds after SQUEZ,' but also said we 'were NOT cleared to descend via the arrival' which made it impossible to comply with the previous clearance to cross SQUEZ at 12,000 and, thus, the assumption that the speeds on the arrival prior to SQUEZ were waved and we were to fly according to their clearance. We told him we wouldn't make SQUEZ at 12,000 so he turned us 30 degrees off course. He asked us our speed before slowing us and we told him we were 310 KTS, so as to make the descent and he asked us if the previous Controller had given us relief from the published speed at ITEMM (280 KTS). We said no. I feel the Center was absolutely negligent in how they issued clearances [requiring us] both to comply with and don't comply with altitudes, speeds, etc., so that we were completely at a loss as we were trying to comply. I even told him exactly what we were doing, how the clearance was received, and finally asked him 'What do you want us to do?'ATC should either clear the flight to proceed via the STAR so both Controller and Crew know what to expect, or if they need to alter any portion of the arrival to suit their needs, then the published restrictions should be overridden by airspeed and altitude vectoring. When Flight Crews are given other than published altitude restrictions or route vectoring, then the published airspeeds should also be assigned by ATC, so that the burden of redirecting the arrival lies solely on the Controller who is now giving clearances other than the published criteria the Flight Crew is expecting to fly. There should be a 'one way' policy to fly an arrival or SID; either via as published or, if needed for traffic flow, then as assigned by the Controller. That way there will be no confusion by either the flight crew or Controllers and it will reduce the workload on both. It will give better accountability for clearances given that require a departure from any published criteria.		We were not told to descend via and we were getting high on the profile. The Captain (PF), asked me if we missed something like a 'descend via' clearance. I stated we did not.		While flying but not 'cleared via' the KOOLY RNAV STAR to PHX the flight crew of a B737-700 was given ambiguous airspeed and altitude clearances with which they were unable to comply.  The controller reprimanded them for not complying with speed restrictions even though he had altered the STAR altitude restrictions.

The initial climb from SJC has the aircraft leveling off at 5,000 FT MSL under the SFO Class B; between 25 and 30 miles from the SFO, the floor of the Class B is 8,000 FT. I set up the display so that we could orient ourselves to the airspace and fly the appropriate speeds. The Captain said that he didn't want me to display the rings of the airspace, because that wasn't a concern. I reminded him that we would be under the Class B and were required to fly 200 KTS. He said that he had been doing this for a long time and had never been violated for speed infractions. We shouldn't worry about it. I told him that, regardless of whether he had been violated, that wasn't the point. There were regulations that were set up for safety reasons, and we still had to follow them. He again told me not to worry. During the climb out, we were level at 5,000 FT and flying 200 KTS. When were given a climb to FL190, the Captain accelerated to 250 KTS out of 6,200 FT MSL under the Class B airspace. He violated the speed limit underneath the Class B.				A Captain violated the SFO Class B speed restriction below 8,000 FT while departing SJC after he instructed the First Officer to remove the Class B rings which were installed to prevent such a violation.

As the Pilot Monitoring, I responded to SoCal on initial contact and confirmed we were cleared to 5,000 feet MSL.  While the autopilot engaged, the Pilot Flying (Captain) flew the departure as per company FOM. At approximately 3,500 feet - 4,000 feet MSL, SoCal called traffic left eleven o'clock, five miles at 6,000 feet MSL converging on our position. SoCal was in contact with the traffic (Pilatus PC-12), as we heard their radio conversation. At approximately 4,100 feet MSL, our aircraft generated a TCAS RA. The Pilot Flying disengaged the autopilot and followed RA guidance. As Pilot Monitoring, I radioed SoCal and informed them we were reacting to a TCAS RA. SoCal acknowledged our radio call, and then directed us to contact LA Center on the prescribed frequency. At no time did SoCal indicate there was any question regarding our proper reaction to the TCAS RA.		Responded to a TCAS RA and climbed out of assigned altitude. Reported to SoCal that we were responding to an RA. SoCal had pointed out the Pilatus traffic to us.		Air carrier departure from SNA, on the noise abatement rapid climb, experienced a TCAS RA with traffic assigned above with minimal IFR separation.

Right after takeoff, Engine #2 Failed with loud bang and jolt. I remained Flying Pilot. Emergency was declared and Captain Emergency Authority exercised. We executed Aircraft Emergency procedures relating to the engine failure. Emergency Equipment was requested.  Flight attendants were advised of the situation and landing expectations.  Aircraft landed safely at a nearby major airport. After stopping on the runway and setting the brake, the aircraft was met on the runway by emergency equipment to inspect and assess the aircraft, and then they escorted us to the gate. Logbook entries made for Engine Failure and Overweight Landing.  The First Officer provided careful, comprehensive, and overall excellent support of working through procedures, checklists, etc. throughout the entire event. The flight attendant crew assured proper cabin procedures, followed instructions, and ensured a calm, orderly and safe arrival at the gate with happy passengers.  Air Traffic Control provided immediate, accurate, and continued expeditious handling and coordination throughout the entire event. Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighters were in position and ready at the time of landing to inspect the aircraft and assure a safe taxi to the gate. In my opinion, the entire crew, ATC, and Emergency system worked well together for an uneventful outcome other than the engine needing repair.		The Captain stabilized the flight path and called for ECAM actions. Tower called to ask intentions. The Captain told me to declare an emergency and we made a decision to fly to a nearby major airport. The decision was based on several factors including the overweight aircraft, runway length, precision approach availability, crash/fire rescue resources and time required to complete appropriate checklist. We believe this decision was consistent with the Land ASAP of the ENG 2 FAIL abnormal procedure. We resumed the ECAM for ENG 2 FAIL (in flight) and after 'no relight', the ECAM was completed assuming engine damage based on aural cues and observation of the ENG 2 gauges. While the Captain, using the autopilot, flew to a nearby large airport, I completed the ENG 2 SHUT DOWN procedure, Overweight Landing procedure and set up the approach in the MCDU. The Captain took over responsibility for most of the radio communications and provided a 'cabin advisory' to the flight attendants. The Captain conducted a stabilized ILS approach visual conditions. After an uneventful, overweight landing, the aircraft was brought to a stop on the runway for inspection by crash fire rescue. The Captain set the parking brake and told the passengers to remain seated. After determining that it was safe to continue, the Captain taxied to the gate while I completed the After Landing checklist. The aircraft parked at the gate and the parking checklist was completed. The Captain and I reviewed Volume 1 to ensure compliance with appropriate logbook entries and required reports. Additionally, the Captain communicated and coordinated with Dispatch, Maintenance, and the Assistant Chief Pilot. Simulator training and the available procedures allowed us to handle the emergency safely and adequately. Unless the committee has additional recommendations, I believe we handled this to the best of our ability, consistent with Volumes 1 and 2.		An A320's right engine failed after gear retraction so an emergency was declared, the QRH completed and the flight diverted to a nearby major airport for an uneventful single engine landing.

While performing the memory items and checklist for Airspeed Unreliable, we received an aural 'airspeed low' message, an IAS Disagree flag, and the EEC's transitioned to soft alternate mode. We completed the EEC Alternate Mode Checklist and the EEC's were transitioned to Hard Mode. We then completed the ALT Disagree Checklist.When we leveled off, I notified ATC of our reduced altimeter and airspeed indicator abilities. After consulting with Dispatch and Maintenance Control, Maintenance recommended a return to our departure airport. We joined the STAR back to the airport where landed without event. My flight instruments returned to normal at about FL180. This aircraft had history of pitot static problems within the previous week. I did perform a thorough review of the logbook prior to flight and was aware of its history. A phone call to Dispatch and Maintenance Control might have given me more insight to the problem at hand.				A B737-700 flight crew consulted with Maintenance and opted to return to their departure airport following receipt of multiple pitot static related anomalies.

We were holding short [Runway] 12R watching a Piper Malibu land. We then were told to line up and wait. As we took position on the runway, Tower cleared the Malibu to turn left and take Taxiway A. The Captain had transferred aircraft control to me as we sat on the runway waiting for our clearance. Tower gave us our takeoff clearance and the Captain answered. I released the brakes and applied takeoff thrust. Approaching 80 KTS, the Tower Controller said something but I didn't recognize what the instructions were or even if the instructions were for us. As I'm accelerating down the runway, I saw the Malibu did not exit the runway and appeared to be have done a 180-degree turn on the runway. My perception of his distance was still a good 6,000 FT away. As I watched, the Malibu started to exit to its right. As this was happening, the Tower repeated instruction to us. At that point, the Captain queried the Controller to say again. I could now see that the Malibu had cleared the runway and the runway ahead was clear. The Tower responded, 'Company Flight Number, cancel takeoff clearance.' The Captain took control of the aircraft and rejected the takeoff. I noted the speed was 105 to 110 KTS and backed up the Captain on the rejected takeoff. We exited the runway to the right on Taxiway A (I think). Tower told us to turn right and taxi to [Runway] 12R. We were clear of the runway and I pulled out the OPC and told the Captain we had a 35-minute wait and had expended 23.6 million foot pounds of energy. I advised Operations and coordinated a gate. The Captain and I discussed whether the brakes were in danger of blowing the fuse plugs. I pulled out the QRH and reviewed the non-normal for rejected takeoff with the Captain and all the considerations. We determined to take aircraft to the available gate and wait out the time at the gate with the engines off.		A Local Controller dealt with a conundrum when a Piper Malibu failed to exit the active runway as cleared, a B737--cleared for takeoff in anticipation of separation--failed to respond to the first two cancellations of his takeoff clearance and another 737 was on final and had to be sent around. Ultimately the Malibu cleared, the first 737 reacted to the third cancellation and the second went around as directed.

The delay in configuration was cause by: crew high work load, last minute runway change, non-standard ATC instructions, out of sequence configuration due to slow traffic ahead and low fuel condition (extended hold/eminent diversion).While enroute to SFO ATC started issuing extended holding patterns due to a marine layer moving in over the Bay Area. Even though we had opted to add extra 1,000 LBS of fuel and flew very efficient profiles, we advised ATC of a possible diversion to SJC 12 minutes from our agreed 'bingo fuel.' Approximately 11 minutes later, we were given vectors for approach to Runway 28R at SFO. ATC issued us a fair amount of delay vectors putting us on a very long final for Runway 28R. With our fuel now being 4,800 LBS, we verbally agreed on changing our alternate from SJC to OAK. ATC had also vectored a slower moving traffic in front of us, and began issuing us very low approach speeds on long final, so considering our distance from the airport, and fuel situation, I elected to extend 'Flaps 3' (out of sequence) and wait on the gear.  As we approached the FAF, I called for: 'Gear Down, Flaps Full, and Landing Checklist.' As the Captain reached for the gear handle, ATC issued a 'go-around', which they recanted immediately and called us in sight (we had broken out of the layer seconds prior to ATC calling for the 'go-around'). With the slower traffic ahead and airport now insight, we requested the visual to Runway 28L. ATC cleared us for both the visual, and for landing Runway 28L.  As I maneuvered for Runway 28L, I called for: 'flaps full.' Captain was entering the new runway in the FMS, after selecting flaps full, he reached for the gear lever while looking at me, and I nodded in agreement. He selected gear down and started to read the 'Landing Checklist'. Seconds later, with the gear still in transit, the 'GPWS' master activated. We both signaled to each other that we were comfortable continuing with the landing given we still had plenty of altitude, were stable, and now fully configured as the gear was now indicating down and locked. We proceeded to land uneventfully on Runway 28L I suggest better dispatch fuel planning on evening flights to SFO. Marine layers seem to happen frequently even when not forecasted.  More leeway on Captain discretion to add fuel: (1,000 LBS) does not go very far on an A320. A go-around is at very best 2,000-2,500 LBS of burn.  ATC avoiding to vector slower traffic in front of larger planes when holding has been issued and/or ATC has been made aware of light fuel load.		First Officer then elected to extend 'Flaps 3' (out of sequence) before deploying landing gear, due to position, ATC spacing assessment and low fuel observation. As spacing improved, First Officer called for 'gear down.' As I reached for the gear handle to select landing gear down, ATC immediately issued a 'go-around' instruction to us--so I did not put the gear down. I held my hand up to the First Officer to signal that gear must now wait (because of the new go-around clearance). This action may have confused him, as he paused before initiating a 'go-around.' Just before he initiated the assigned 'go-around,' ATC then cancelled the 'go-around' clearance, saying, 'Tower has you in sight,' and where we were now told to continue approach (even though we had just over 2 miles separation from the preceding slowing aircraft). I was certain that another 'go-around' was going to be issued behind the slowing aircraft ahead, and very cognizant of our low fuel situation, so I initiated a request for Runway 28L while above 1,000 feet. ATC cleared us to land on Runway 28L and I began to activate the new runway in the FMS for accurate glide slope and an unexpected go-around into clouds. First Officer quickly called for 'flaps full' while he aligned the aircraft, where I was already looking down. I selected flaps full, verified the runway was clear, and then looked at the First Officer while reaching to select landing gear down. He nodded in agreement and said 'gear down' while I selected the gear down, and I attempted to read the landing checklist. While the gear was in transit, the GPWS master warning activated. Perhaps an earlier call to ATC for advising of our TIME UNTIL DIVERSION (i.e., at 15 mins. vs. at 12 mins.) would have alleviated the stresses, and prompted ATC to sequence us before the slower aircraft--essentially eliminating out of sequence flap selection and erroneous 'go-around' directives. Following SOP 'to the T' despite major distractions. Another suggestion would be to allow for more holding fuel, above the Captain's 1,000 lb. limit, to alleviate fuel concerns and accommodate overwhelmed ATC facilities.		ATC put slower traffic ahead of an A320 on a Runway 28L ILS and while slowing for that traffic, Flaps 3 were selected causing an EGPWS warning because the gear was still up as ATC issued, then canceled a go-around.

We heard a pop and felt the aircraft shudder and yaw. We could feel the airframe shake and heard a grinding as the engine came to a stop. The autopilot was on and both the Captain and I put our hands on the controls as he stated we had lost the number one engine. He then gave me aircraft control as he began to coordinate with ATC for a descent. He pulled up single-engine drift down speed and we began running the Engine Seizure Checklist.  We declared our emergency and told ATC we wanted to return to our departure airport. We continued to run the QRH and prepared for a single-engine landing. We had instinctively agreed the departure airport was our preferred return point and, based on our distance at this point of around 95 miles and our altitude of around FL 330, it seemed like an easy straight line 3-1 descent back to the airport. I did briefly consider diverting to ZZZ1 but decided against suggesting it because ZZZ1 often requires a steep descent after clearing the mountains and I wasn't sure we could make it at Flaps 15. Also, we had just landed and departed with it fresh in our mind and with a near perfect descent profile I figured it would give us plenty of time to complete all the necessary items without feeling rushed. The Captain later told me he considered all the airports in the area and came to the same conclusion himself and so we continued without any hesitation. The checklist, approach, and landing went well. We made our way through the checklist methodically and the Captain briefed the flight attendants (who were calm and collected the whole time) and made a PA to the passengers explaining the situation. We called Operations to advise them of our return and situation.  Dispatch had been on the line and gave us a quick check-in, it seemed almost just to let us know they were in the loop which saved us some extra radio time and allowed us to focus on arrival. Center gave us great handling and I think we talked to one Approach before Tower but not sure. With all the checklists complete and the aircraft lined up on final, the Captain assumed the controls and brought us in for landing. The emergency vehicles were waiting and, after landing, we taxied clear of the runway. The Captain asked the fire patrol to check the engine/aircraft for any visible threats and when they said all clear we taxied to Gate XX with the fire truck following behind. We had some concern of trying to make a hard right turn into the number two engine on the approach to the gate and the Captain requested a tow-in for safety which Operations happily provided. They were ready and waiting on us when we pulled abeam the gate.  Maintenance also met the aircraft to perform their initial inspection as well. We had a bit of activity in the front galley cockpit area with Maintenance asking questions and passengers deplaning and the Captain and I trying to get ourselves situated. The Captain and I felt like there was too much going on so he asked for a little space for a minute as we both really wanted to be in front of the passengers so they could see everything was OK. The passengers were very appreciative to the crew as a whole, and I heard many compliments to the flight attendants as they exited the plane. It was easy to see many of the passengers needed some reassurance and I felt like they really wanted a personal engagement after going through, for many of them, a very stressful experience.Overall, I felt pretty good about the whole experience. I thought as a crew we worked well together. Procedures and checklists were done methodically and accurately. I felt like the Captain kept a calm, steady command of the situation while skillfully negotiating the steps for a successful conclusion. He showed genuine concern for the passengers during deplaning and we both took time afterward to talk with the flight attendants to make sure they were OK. I felt the Flight Attendants did a fine job. I usually have my service button engaged during flight and, at one point, they got on to talk to each other after completing their task.  I'll say I was proud to hear them talking in calm, reassuring tones leaving no doubt in mind everything was fine in the back and the Captain and I could concentrate on our tasks without any concerns.  The 'crew members' outside the airplane did a good job too and I feel this was really a 'normal-abnormal' event.		I felt a significant vibration and saw that Number 1 Engine Vibration indicator reading 4.9 momentarily and then quickly subsiding. All engine performance and indications were normal prior to this event. A few seconds later, more significant vibration and engine instruments on the Upper Display Unit (UDU) showed Engine Exceedence Indication white box and more significant vibrations with yaw. Immediately following, the Number 1 engine started to roll back and amber Engine Fail alert appeared. There was no indication of fire or smoke but very significant vibrations continued until the engine seized. I coordinated with ARTCC to declare an emergency and descend to a FMC directed engine out altitude of FL 285 and airspeed of 226 knots. As the aircraft slowed, the engine vibration lessened then stopped but the engine indicators were showing a seized engine soon after (No N1 or N2).Better engine monitor and Maintenance could forward engine trends to pilots, although we saw no abnormal indications. I would like to see our QRH boxed letters and number narratives to be bullet statements rather than full sentences to expedite and to highlight in time critical situations.		A B737-700 number one engine seized at FL390 following significant engine vibrations, so an emergency was declared, the QRH completed, and the flight returned to the departure airport.

On the arrival from the east, we were given a reroute to fly backwards and fly a new arrival from the north. Then on that arrival we were given another reroute to an arrival from the west. We knew we could not do this without being very short on fuel. When ATC said we would be issued holding we told them we would have to divert. ZZZ was chosen because from our position we could not make our alternate, without being on empty. We declared an emergency with ATC and landed with 3.5 total, or 1.7 per side. Low level lights were on. At gate with 3.2.		While enroute the weather closed our arrival. We were turned to a VOR which was behind us. We were then assigned another arrival which we started. The new arrival was then closed due to weather and another arrival was issued. We calculated our fuel and determined that we were good for now. We were then told to expect holding, at that time we determined that ZZZ was our best option. We asked for priority handling but while enroute the low fuel lights illuminated so an emergency was declared. We landed without incident.		B737-800 flight crew reports being vectored off the cleared arrival from the east due to weather, and sent north for a north arrival. When this arrival is also closed down by weather the crew is vectored for a west arrival and issued holding instructions. The crew elects to divert to an unplanned alternate at this point and declares an emergency when the low fuel lights come on, landing with 3,500 pounds of fuel.

I put my hand on the controls in case I needed to disengage the autopilot. I saw my airspeed decreasing through 170 KTS and we received a FMC warning 'VNAV disengaged' at night, in the weather. I disengaged the autopilot and applied emergency thrust and started a gradual descent to increase airspeed. I called out to the First Officer, 'We're stalling!' I told him to tell ATC we needed an immediate descent. As we were in the descent, we got the clacker. The First Officer and I crosschecked the instruments and deducted that the First Officer's airspeed was reliable while Captain's was not. We performed the memory items for Unreliable Airspeed. We transferred control of the aircraft. The First Officer leveled off at about FL358 and reduced airspeed. I lowered the HUD and decided to maintain altitude with the HUD. So I put the airplane reference symbol on the horizon while my airspeed was indicating 150 KTS on the HUD and Captain airspeed tape. We declared an emergency and told ATC that we were going to attempt to maintain FL350. Using the HUD, I leveled off at FL350. We then noticed that the First Officer's altimeter was showing FL358. We decided not to use the autopilot since the Captain's airspeed and First Officer's altimeter was unreliable. We declared an emergency and diverted. Landing was uneventful. The situation was amplified because of night IMC. I thought the autothrottles were malfunctioning because of turbulence. I thought we were stalling at FL380. The First Officer and I were both calling out airspeed. Of course mine was too low and his was too high. After we realized that my airspeed was unreliable, we transferred control to the First Officer who had good information. A quicker crosscheck of instruments would have prevented the airframe overspeed, but at that time, things were a little hectic.		Cruise Flight at FL380. On top of the weather. Tops reported at FL360. FMC message, VERT NAV Disconnect. As the pilot not flying, I advised the Captain the VNAV has disconnected. I began to scan my instruments to determine the cause, and my instruments looked normal, but we began a shallow descent and the Captain disconnected the autopilot. I called out, we are descending. The Captain acknowledged and said, I think we are stalling. Due to the stall recovery the Captain was performing, I called ATC and advised we are descending. Coordination was difficult with ATC due to congestion. ATC asked if we were in a mountain wave and could we maintain FL350. I began to scan my instruments and saw .82 Mach and increasing, along with a VSI pegged below 5,000 FPM. I immediately looked and the Captain's instruments and realized his airspeed indicator malfunctioned. I crosschecked my airspeed and altimeter with the STBY and determined his airspeed was INOP. I voiced my concern by pulling the thrust levers back to idle, and said your airspeed is INOP. The PLANE is FLYING, STOP your descent. I verified the probe heat was on, and the Captain said your airplane. I took the controls, and pulled us out of a 5,000 FPM descent with speeds exceeding .85 Mach. I was able to gain control of the aircraft, climb back up to FL350, and maintain .74 Mach. We then declared an emergency and were handed to Center. The Captain and I began to run the checklists and determine the state of the aircraft. We determined through coordinating with ATC, STBY instruments, HUD, and the FMC that the Captain's airspeed was INOP and the First Officer's altimeter was INOP. We ran the appropriate checklist and decided to divert. Weather there was VFR. We began a shallow descent with the Captain flying the HUD and the First Officer controlling the airspeed. As we descended through FL250, our instruments began to return to normal, and all indications through cross reference became normal. I elected to fly the visual since my airspeed did not malfunction. We landed in an overweight condition. The aircraft taxied to the gate uneventful with CFR to follow.Remain calm and analyze the situation. Don't make quick reactions without voicing your intentions. Use CRM. Maintain a better situation awareness by following the memory items and the checklists.		B737-700 flight crew experiences failure of the Captain's airspeed indication at FL380 and the Captain reacts to the slow indication by descending. The aircraft reaches Mach .85 descending at 5,000 FPM before the First Officer can determine which airspeed indication is accurate. The crew elects to divert to a suitable alternate and the Captain's airspeed begins to function normally passing through FL250.

He saw it was the Oil Filter Bypass light on the number one engine that quickly extinguished. We read through the QRH for the oil filter bypass. 3-4 minutes after the initial light came on the oil filter bypass light illuminated and stayed on. The QRH procedure was followed and the number one thrust lever was retarded to idle and the light once again extinguished. A descent was initiated to FL180. 2-3 minutes after the oil filter bypass light extinguished it again came on and stayed on, the QRH was followed and the number one engine was shut down. A divert was discussed and requested from ATC. An emergency was declared, Dispatch was contacted, the flight attendants were informed and a PA made to the passengers. We were cleared direct and set up for an ILS. The approach was set up briefed and the single engine QRH was completed. The performance data was received and discussed with Flaps 15 auto brake 3 was set the overweight landing was discussed. The approach and landing was uneventful on rollout only the right thrust reverser was used and the aircraft stopped 7,000 FT down the runway with a touchdown right at 1,000 FT. The parking brake was set and the aircraft was inspected by the fire chief with no abnormal observations. The equipment was cleared and an attempt was made but the aircraft would not move. Several attempts were made. The passengers were deplaned through L1 via stairs onto busses and transported to the terminal.		At cruise altitude I observed the left engine oil filter bypass light illuminate and then extinguish. I called it to the Captain's attention and we began to review the QRH procedure. A moment later the light came on again. We followed the procedure which ultimately called for the shutdown of engine number one. We completed the engine failure/shutdown QRH, advised the flight attendants and passengers, advised Dispatch and Maintenance, obtained weather and performance data and landed uneventfully. After landing we stopped on the runway to have the ARFF folks check the airplane out since we landed overweight, fast and at a high altitude airport. They gave us the all clear to taxi, but upon releasing the parking brake the aircraft would not budge. We ended up deplaning the passengers and FAs onto buses where they were shuttled to the terminal. The CA and I remained with MX personnel to assist until we had no more ability to help. We then joined the FAs and debriefed in the terminal.		B737-800 flight crew reports an oil filter bypass light illuminating at cruise altitude, the thrust lever is retarded in compliance with QRH procedures and the light extinguishes. The light returns shortly after, the engine is shut down and the flight diverts to the nearest suitable airport.

Then asked us about our transition and if we were familiar with the FISSK NOTAM. We were not so we re-reviewed (briefly since we were on approach) the weather pack and discovered the FDC NOTAM on Page 5. We were flying the charted procedure of HALIE Intersection then 292 track to HILLS. The NOTAM buried on Page 5 is 270 track to CGT then 335 heading. CGT is not even depicted on the chart! I didn't really carry on the conversation with ATC since we were concerned with flying the approach and all of my responses were very brief. It was not the time or place to be discussing our error. We proceeded to land uneventfully. After landing, I called Dispatch to let them know about our issue, so they could warn other FISSK arrivals. Bottom line, I missed the FDC NOTAM. We had a MEL issue. The weather had been bad the previous two days and today was an absolutely beautiful day causing me to lower my guard. I learned my lesson. If this NOTAM has been around for a while the chart needs to be changed or eliminated! Developing procedures and then modifying them for long periods of time is asking for safety issues! We should not be filed on this arrival until it is corrected. This should have been on the cover page of the weather pack and even on the ATIS.		On arrival into MDW, we were flying the FISSK 2. On the chart and in the NAV database, after HALIE Intersection you fly a 292 track to HILLS intersection. This is what we were doing just after HALIE. There was a NOTAM however that modified the arrival. Per the NOTAM, after HALIE we should have flown a 270 track to CGT VOR. The Captain and I both failed to remember seeing this NOTAM.The crew could have taken more time with the weather package. We both read it, but read it in a hurry. This was a pretty significant NOTAM in that it totally changed the course on the arrival. I'm NOT blaming the weather package, but if this was on the cover sheet as a highlight instead of on Page 5 it might have got our attention more easily. Flew arrival per chart/FMC database but did NOT modify it per NOTAM.		B737 flight crew reports being informed they are off track on the FISSK 2 RNAV to MDW due to not being aware of a NOTAM modification to the procedure.

The First Officer then made a manual request for new takeoff performance data because of the tailwind component. As we approached the threshold, the Tower called us to line up and wait. We told him that we were waiting for new numbers, so he then told us to hold short. He said to notify him when we were ready, and that he showed winds were calm. I noticed at that time that he seemed somewhat upset that we were not ready.  As we waited for our numbers to upload into the FMC, the Tower cleared an MD-80 for takeoff from intersection B1, followed by a B757-300. We notified him that we were ready, and he cleared us to line up and wait. We went into position on the threshold, and just after the 757 took off (rotated), the Tower cleared us for takeoff. I asked the Tower Controller (before accepting the clearance and before starting our takeoff roll) if we had enough separation with the 757. My transmission was blocked during my first try, then I asked again to confirm. The Tower Controller stated, in a very stern and condescending tone, that we had 'twice the required separation' and that we were cleared for takeoff. I stated that I was just double checking, and then read back that we were cleared for takeoff. By that time, the 757 was far enough upwind that I felt safe enough to takeoff. I asked him initially because of my concern for our safety following a B757 so closely due to wake turbulence. I was not certain that our B737-900 could out climb the B757 that preceded us. Again, he initially cleared us for takeoff just after the 757 rotated. I don't recall in my professional career ever being cleared for takeoff so soon behind a heavy jet, so I did not feel comfortable with our situation.  At approximately 400 FT AGL, the Tower Controller then began to reprimand us for my question. He stated that he never remembers '[my company]' asking for a delay, and stated other things that I don't recall. This reprimand started at about the same time we had to start important cockpit procedures and tasks. It was very distracting, and in my opinion a safety risk. He spoke to us until we past 1,000 FT AGL. At 1,000 FT AGL, we had more cockpit procedures. The First Officer called for those, and I complied. I was not able to respond to anything the Tower had said until they were completed. I then responded, but unfortunately my oxygen mic mask switch was on by accident. He called us one more time and I answered him by only stating our call sign and also saying, 'Go ahead.' He sternly replied by only telling us to switch to Departure. I feel that the Tower Controller was upset with us as soon as we had to wait for our takeoff numbers. Then, when I questioned the lack of delay behind the B757, it made things worse. I was only trying to assure the safety of my aircraft, crew, and passengers. No more, no less. That is my job and chief concern as the Captain. I was not certain that our B737-900 could out climb the B757 that preceded us. I felt that his reprimand as we were climbing out was completely unprofessional, distracting, and an extreme risk to our safety. The situation could have been dealt with in a much more profession manner. He should have had more respect and concern for our situation and for my authority as Captain.		Per instructions, we contacted Ground Control at Spot 1. They issued clearance to taxi to 25R, and announced that the hourly update to the ATIS was out, and that the wind was now '090 at four knots'. This triggered the need to update our performance numbers, as we now were departing downwind. Approaching the end of 25R, as I was preparing to brief and scan for the new numbers (the Taxi and Takeoff Checklists were still 'to go', though I had given the PA to the cabin), Tower cleared us to line up and wait, and expect an approximately one minute delay due to traffic on the crossing runway. I responded that that should work out since we were updating our numbers for the downwind departure. Tower responded by rescinding the clearance onto the runway 'If you don't have your numbers yet. The wind is calm.' The Captain acknowledged holding short of the runway, and I acknowledged to Tower. In point of fact, in spite of what Ground Control had said, the new ATIS stated the wind as 160 at 4, a direct crosswind - so technically, the update was unnecessary. BUT, we had already made the decision based on what Ground Control had said - PLUS the windsocks were all showing a trend toward an easterly breeze. After we advised Tower that we were ready, the Controller held us short while they departed several aircraft from intersection A2. The last of those was a 757. The 757 rolled a long way. It was barely airborne, if at all, when Tower cleared us for takeoff. The Captain asked me, 'Can we do that?' He queried the Tower to verify that a proper wake turbulence interval was provided. 'BLOCKED' was the next thing either of us heard. Tower then repeated our takeoff clearance. The Captain repeated his query. The response was, 'Calling McCarran Tower, say again?' The Captain repeated his query again. At this point, the Tower Controller's tone became overtly hostile. Paraphrasing: 'There's no wake turbulence! The distance between you and the departing traffic is...you have twice what you need! Cleared for takeoff!' The Captain acknowledged and we departed. When we were approximately 400 feet AGL (I know, because I was still waiting to make my 'verify LNAV' call), the Controller began a tirade (paraphrasing, again): -'In the future, if you want extra wake turbulence separation, you need to tell us that before you are in position on the runway!' {We appropriately didn't respond.} -{800 feet AGL} 'Callsign, Tower!' -the Captain tried to say 'Roger,' or 'Standby,' or something, but was experiencing difficulties transmitting. I was busy flying and making calls. REMEMBER - this is the SHEAD departure - one of the most complicated, threat-rich, brainpower-sucking departure procedures in our system! I kind of felt I had to keep the Captain focused on the procedure instead of the Tower - I called for the ATO checklist at least twice. -{Somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 feet, prior TO the first turn on the SID, and before completion of the ATO checklist} 'Callsign, MCCARRAN TOWER, OVER!' -When the Captain had an appropriate break in his aviating and navigating duties, he answered. At that point, all the Tower said was 'CONTACT DEPARTURE!!' The primary cause of this event, and my primary reason for submitting this report, is the very significant safety hazard (severe distraction at an extremely critical phase of flight) created by a Tower Controller's angry response to the hassle we created for him in the course of properly performing our duties.		B737 flight crew reports a difference of opinions with a Tower Controller at LAS concerning wake turbulence separation.

On rotation at intersection of 28/32L, at 5-10 FT AGL, severe right crosswind gust.  No gusts reported in ATIS.  I suspect gust was from takeoff thrust of aircraft that was on 32L.  I noticed aircraft in position during my takeoff roll. I did not hear his takeoff clearance; suspect different frequencies (unsure).  While still flat at initial rotation at 5-10 FT, there was a noticeable and uncomfortable gust that I was able to control.  Gust/skid was uncomfortable & noticed by the First Officer, Pilot Monitoring.  Aircraft displacement off centerline (airborne) at time of event.  It felt like the aircraft was skidding right to left at 5 ft AGL.  It did not feel like a regular gust, and no other gusts were encountered on climbout.[I suggest] do not clear aircraft for takeoff from 32L while aircraft take off on 28.				A B737-800 took off on ORD Runway 28 and at rotation was displaced about 5 feet by the thrust of an aircraft taking off from Runway 32L.

The second write-up was cleared by replacing the overheat loops on the right engine. The First Officer and I discussed this during preflight. During climb, through 15,000 FT, the ENG 2 Overheat light illuminated.  I called for the Overheat Checklist.  The First Officer asked for and received a level off at 15,000 FT.  We ran the checklist.  When the thrust lever was retarded to approximately 75% N1, the light extinguished.  We read the notes and agreed that we did not have to land immediately.  We discussed our next course of action and agreed that we should continue the climb. I advanced the thrust levers to climb power.  Approximately 60 seconds after climb power was set, the ENG 2 Overheat light illuminated again. We ran the Overheat Checklist.  The light extinguished at approximately 75% N1.  We leveled off at FL210, contacted Dispatch, and advised ATC that we were evaluating a problem.  Dispatch advised that Maintenance Control preferred a maintenance station for landing.  We ran the landing performance numbers with the current ATIS and a landing weight of 136,000.  The landing was legal on all preferred runways at Flaps 30 and Flaps 40 with no brake energy limits.  All runways were [bracketed] at 1, 2 and 3.  We both decided it was a safe diversion airport.  I received an amendment to the Release from Dispatch.  ATC was notified and we received our diversion clearance. We verified that all diversion needs were fulfilled by using the Diversion Checklist on the back of the Normal Checklist.  The descent was normal and uneventful.  During descent, the First Officer brought up single-engine landing if the light illuminated during the approach.  The First Officer ran the landing numbers in for a Flaps 15 landing.  The landing would be legal (1, 2 3 and a BOLD B (brake energy)).  We decided that if the light illuminated during the approach, we would request vectors, run the Single-Engine Landing Checklist, and then proceed inbound for landing.  The light did not illuminate and I landed Flaps 40 without incident.  Taxi in and parking occurred without incident. Upon review, I feel that the QRH does not intend for the continued high power use of the engine.  I am used to seeing verbiage about landing at the nearest suitable airport if that is required.  I now feel that once the light illuminated we should have run the Engine 2 Overheat Checklist, then started the diversion plan.  I forgot about the possibility of single-engine landing until the First Officer brought it up during descent.  Reviewing the QRH checklist used one last time may have triggered me to brief this.  Once we had the issue contained and were inbound for landing, I became focused on the overweight landing and ensuring a safe, smooth landing at a confined airport.  I appreciate the great coordination, professionalism, and help from the First Officer.				A B737-700 ENG 2 OVERHEAT light illuminated during climb after Maintenance had cleared the item earlier, so the flight diverted to a nearby maintenance station.

After we cleaned-up the aircraft, the Captain selected the autopilot on, selected VNAV, and reset the altitude window from 7,000 FT to FL190. Separation from Company flight appeared normal for LAS, about 2.5 to 3 NM. Approaching 7,000 FT both aircraft began to level. I mentioned that we might get some wake turbulence since we were both at the same altitude. We seemed to be closing on the other aircraft a bit but I expected our paths or altitudes would diverge soon, as usual. I heard ATC give the other aircraft a climb and maintain FL190 clearance. I thought that with both of us at 250 KTS (obviously that was a bad assumption as the other aircraft must have been going much slower than 250 KTS) and him climbing that separation wouldn't be a problem. About a minute later, we started to get some of his wake turbulence. I noticed that we were getting much closer to him and he wasn't climbing. I mentioned to the Captain that we were getting closer. At this point, he disconnected the autopilot and turned slightly to the right to increase separation and get out of his wake. A moment later we got an RA to climb. The Captain followed the RA and I informed ATC. ATC then told us to climb and maintain FL190 and turn direct COWBY, approximately 70-degree left turn. The other aircraft was to our left. The Captain didn't want to take a hard turn into him so he began his climb and started a slow turn to the left trying to keep the other aircraft in sight. Shortly thereafter, we got a second climb RA. The Captain followed that RA also. ATC queried the other aircraft about what they were doing and they confirmed that they had also received multiple RAs. When the RA was resolved, we continued on course to COWBY and climbed to FL 190. The other aircraft must have turned the other direction at ROPPR because we didn't hear or see them again. That spacing and procedure normally works well at LAS. If ATC had let us know that our paths would diverge at ROPPR or that we had a large overtake on the other aircraft, we could have reacted differently. It's difficult to tell closure rate in this situation.				B737-700 First Officer reported receiving multiple RA's and wake vortex turbulence on departure from LAS.

The Captain was monitoring the aircraft while I got out of my seat to open the door and retrieve the meals. After sitting back down in my seat, I glanced down at the airspeed and saw it rapidly decaying to green dot. I then looked at the airspeed window on the display management panel and noted that a speed of 205 KTS was displayed in the speed window. I made a callout to the Captain of 'airspeed.' We did not have enough thrust to stop the airspeed from deteriorating, so the Captain disconnected the autopilot and lowered the nose to accelerate. As he lowered the nose, he began a gradual descent. He then instructed me to call ATC and ask for a block altitude. As he was asking me to call ATC, Center called us and asked us our altitude and we requested a block altitude of 330-370. The request for the block altitude was granted. I was quite busy monitoring the airspeed and radio, but I believe we descended 500-600 FT to get the airspeed back and start climbing. We climbed back up to 370 without any further incident.	The First Officer reported that the Captain entered the performance data during preflight and when scrolling through the Performance Preflight pages somehow skipped over the Climb Performance page and in the following page, Cruise Performance, entered 205 KTS. As a result, when the aircraft leveled at FL370, just as the reporter was retrieving crew meals, the aircraft slowed toward 205 KTS and the Captain did not immediately see the decrease. As a result, the heavy A320 could not accelerate by thrust alone and so an altitude decrease was necessary.			An A320 Captain entered the preflight performance data and apparently skipped the Climb Performance page and entered 205 KTS as the Cruise Performance airspeed parameter which resulted in a speed loss during transition from climb to cruise.

I selected VHF L rather than leaving the radio selection as it was. My selection of VHF L placed the Captain's radio control panel on the First Officer panel side.  I looked down and noticed the incorrect frequency for Ramp and said I would correct it. By doing this I changed the frequency of the Captain's head from Approach Control to Ramp in the active window and Guard in the secondary.   Captain called Ramp and was unable to contact them.

I PUSHED VHF L DUE TO 12 YEARS OF MUSCLE MEMORY OF SELECTIONS ON THE Airbus. I SELECTED THE INCORRECT BUTTON. 3 MIN LATER WE RECOGNIZED THE CALL ON GUARD FREQUENCY THAT I SHIFTED OVER TO VHF L. THIS WAS MY FIRST FLIGHT IN THE AIRCRAFT. DURING TRAINING MANY INSTRUCTORS STATED THAT WE USE AND DIAL UP THE CORRECT FREQUENCY DURING EACH SIM.  WE DID JUST THAT.  HOWEVER WE ALWAYS USED VHF L.  WE ONCE USED SATCOM WHICH WAS VERY INSTRUCTIONAL.  I DO NOT RECALL EVER USING VHF R AND GOING BACK TO VHF L. A SIMPLE PROCEDURE IN ITSELF, HOWEVER IN A BUSY ENVIRONMENT SIMPLE ITEMS LIKE THIS CAN CREATE LARGER PROBLEMS. OVERALL THE TRAINING IS GREAT. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE DESIRE TO REDUCE TRAINING EVENTS THUS COST WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED MORE INFORMATION INTO EACH EVENT THAN CAN BE DIGESTED BY THE STUDENT. TAKE THE EXISTING CURRICULUM AND SPREAD IT INTO ONE ADDITIONAL FTD AND ONE ADDITIONAL SIM. TAKE THE OPERATIONS SIM AND PLACE IT AFTER THE LINE ORIENTED FLIGHT SIM.  THE OPERATIONS SIM IS THE OVERSEAS AND TRANS OCEANIC OPS.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO FOCUS ON THIS MATERIAL PRIOR TO A CHECK RIDE.  IF THIS TRAINING WAS PLACED PRIOR TO DOING THE ACTUAL AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MUCH MORE WOULD BE GAINED.  EFB HAS BEEN REFERENCED IN TRAINING BUT LITTLE IF ANY TIME HAS BEEN PUT ASIDE TO TRAIN IT.  TOO MANY ITEMS TO PROPERLY COVER IN ALLOCATED TIME.  GREAT INSTRUCTORS DOING THE BEST WITH THE TIME THEY ARE ALLOCATED.

Traffic displayed on TCAS at 1:00 heading directly toward us and descending toward our altitude. Flight crew inquired and ATC Controller advised 'There is no traffic'. Pilot Flying was hand flying and turned slightly north of course to increase spacing from TCAS displayed traffic. TCAS showed traffic passed approximately 3 miles from us on a Southeast course near our altitude. We did get visual on the traffic. Pilot Monitoring inquired again with ATC and was advised that traffic was beyond 5 miles. Our TCAS displayed well within 5 miles, near 3 miles. Our ground speed at the time was 471 KTS which would most likely be somewhere in excess of 900 KTS closure rate. I believe that if Pilot Flying had not turned away impact could have occurred. Suggestions, proficiency analysis on said Controller.		About 40 ESE of SRQ during climb from FL360 to FL380, as assigned by ATC, we received TA traffic. On TCAS traffic showed at our one o'clock, at our altitude, moving right to left. I was set at the 10 mile map mode on my navigation display. I inquired ATC about traffic at our altitude and he responded that we had no traffic ahead of us. We spotted the traffic and it had moved just to the left of our nose. Captain turned gently about 5 to 10 degrees right for a period of less than 20 seconds as aircraft passed. I inquired with ATC about the now sighted traffic again and he responded that traffic had required 5 mile separation. It appeared to the Captain and I that the aircraft was probably closer than 5 miles by sight and TCAS readout. We resumed normal course.		Air Carrier, with ZMA climbing to FL380, described a TCAS RA event, turning slightly from the observed traffic, the reporter noting that a certain impact would have occurred had not the turn been initiated.

This occurred for about five seconds then the radar test pattern appeared on both Pilots' DU's. The Pilot Flying said basically, 'That's not correct. I'm continuing.' Before I could say, 'No, let's go-around,' the radar test pattern started to be displayed on both Pilots' DU's, so we continued the approach to landing. Once at the gate, I discussed with the other pilot that we should have gone around even though we deemed the warning as faulty. Regardless of what you think, any time the aircraft tells you to go-around, you should.				A B737NG EGPWS issued a 'GO AROUND, WINDSHEAR AHEAD' alert in day VMC at 1,000 FT so the crew continued the approach to a normal landing.

We were following an RJ by about 4 miles, and were fully configured at minimum speed on a 15-mile final, and gaining on the aircraft ahead. When we checked in with Tower over LEMON, they advised to 'continue... traffic will be holding in position.' When the RJ landed, a B737 was told to line up and wait, be ready for an immediate takeoff. We received our landing clearance at about 500 FT on final. The 737 got off the ground as we were at about 300 FT on final, and when we got over the runway threshold, we encountered lots of jet wash from the plane. The approach was stable and I continued the landing, just very rough right at the most critical time of landing. This spacing was too close. I think the 737 flight crew could have waited another minute or two until after we had landed-there was a lot of space between us and the next landing airplane. This has been happening for a while now at SNA, but it seems to be happening more often, and getting closer. This was the closest I've ever seen.

I believe the preceding B777 was airborne before we crossed the hold short line to hold on the runway. There was sufficient time for a couple of aircraft to cross the runway downfield before we took off. We reported the wake turbulence to the Departure Controller and she stated that the preceding B777 was eight miles south of our position. I am submitting this report because I believe we had proper separation from the preceding B777 and the aircraft still encountered wake turbulence.

Approach Control gave us a heading of '120 degrees to join the localizer, cross XXX at 3,000, 170 knots until 5 mile final, cleared for the LOC XXX approach'.  The Pilot Flying accidentally reached for the IAS knob instead of the Heading knob, and selected 120 knots.  Pilot Monitoring was verifying the crossing restriction on the FMC and looking for the indicated traffic, and did not visually backup the Pilot Flying in the heading selection.  The Pilot Flying looked down at the FMC to validate for himself the LNAV/VNAV setup.  We both noticed that the aircraft was not responding to the heading selection, looked up to the Mode Control Panel to check the control inputs, realized the error, then quickly noticed that the airspeed had dropped well below the Flaps 10 Minimum Maneuver speed to approximately 135 knots.  No secondary indications occurred.  Pilot Flying immediately applied power and recovered the airspeed to 170 knots. The remainder of the approach and landing were completed uneventfully.  Debrief thoughts: Though we had an early wake up, we both felt well rested before departure.  Pilot Flying did not follow his hand with his eyes when he reached for the desired control, then diverted his attention to the FMC for ATC compliance.  Pilot Monitoring allowed himself to become preoccupied with outside traffic, locating the assigned runway, and verifying FMC compliance instead of backing up the Pilot Flying in his heading control selection.  Although two experienced and conscientious pilots were involved, this sharply reinforces the need for both pilots to be actively attentive to control inputs.		No additional information contained in this report.		While being vectored for an ILS in VMC conditions the crew of a Boeing 737 was given a heading of 120 degrees and the pilot flying, utilizing the autopilot and autothrottle functions, mistook the IAS selector for the heading select dial and set 120 knots.  When the airspeed had decayed to about 135 knots, well below the 10 degree selected flap minimum maneuver speed, the PF noticed the deteriorated energy state and immediately restored power and airspeed back to 170 knots.

Normal departure and climb until ATC cleared us direct WAVIE. I selected WAVIE to 1L ...yup looks good, like that?  LNAV.  As we are rolling through a HDG 270, ATC informs us we are 'off course'  and re-clears us DCT WAVIE.  WAVIE is in 1L and LNAV is engaged pointing us further to the right.  ATC then gives us a 'heading 180 DCT WAVIE when able.'  It dawns on me to ask for the phonetic spelling of WAVIE .  ATC replies 'Whiskey Alpha Victor Echo Yankee...... WAVEY.'   I corrected the spelling of WAVIE in 1L, and it provided a heading of 150, LNAV engaged again and all is well.  I explain to ATC the WAVIE vs. WAVEY input error (on my part during the re-route on the ground) and received a bemused chuckle from ATC.  They didn't seem at all surprised by this, more like we were just one more flight crew who fell into that trap.  1) Mileage on PROG page was significantly more, so we checked all the points again, 3 times!!!  Paper to glass, glass to paper et al.  We thought the mileage discrepancy was due to route discontinuities on both the departure, and arrival ends.  2) We did not have a new flight plan so could not check heading and distance to next waypoint to see if it makes sense only the flight plan review. I am reading WAVIE, and my First Officer is hearing (and seeing WAVEY on the flight plan review) what's the problem?   3) Short of checking the spelling for each point, you would have to check the heading on the FMC to the next point to see if it makes sense, and we do not do that. One pilot reads the points off the ND for continuity, and the other pilot confirms them against the flight plan paper copy. You would need to do international procedures (like on the over water portion of the NAT) to catch this.

The PDC cleared us - BEECH3 BAHMA ZQA -. During the preflight I checked the PDC against the filed route and against the FMC.  Noticing the change, I searched the enroute charts to verify the difference.  Somehow I went into the chart looking for RAJAY instead of ZQA, and I believe what happened was that I noticed RAJAY was on A555, so I assumed it was one of those PDC changes that does not change the route at all, just highlights a point along the already filed route. Even when I determine that such a PDC change is the case, I always enter it that way (as listed in the PDC) in the FMC and note the change (whether it is an actual change in the route or not) during my clearance briefing.   For some reason, I broke my routine this time, did not enter the PDC change (as I had mistakenly concluded there was no actual change to the route) and the PDC change to fly over ZQA was not caught prior to takeoff.  Enroute to RAJAY, ATC queried us regarding our clearance and informed us we should have been going to ZQA. I see two ways to mitigate these types of PDC errors:1)  First officers should always enter the PDC exactly as shown in the FMC, even if a change is clearly no change at all, just breaking out a waypoint on an already filed airway.2)  The PDC change notation could be cleaned up and made clearer.  Also, PDC changes that do not actually change the route at all should be eliminated. Certainly no excuse, but I think two factors led me to make this error.  One, of course, was going into the enroute chart looking for the wrong waypoint (RAJAY vice ZQA).  The other was having had quite a few PDC changes recently that did not change the actual filed route at all. That and perhaps being slightly rushed led me to be satisfied that there was no actual route change this time and to not change the FMC routing - first time I ever did that, I believe.  Completely my fault and lesson learned.   Proper procedures would have caught my mistake if followed.		Enroute to RAJAY, Center asked if we were direct ZQA. We replied negative going to RAJAY. He asked what we were cleared from Tower. There was some confusion with the First Officer and the radio. I pulled up the PDC and noticed we had missed a change. PDC showed BAHMA ZQA A555 GTK, the flight plan showed BAHMA RAJAY A555 GTK. We eventually got that across. Center asked if it was a verbal or PDC. He told us not an issue today, but that we needed to get the word out. Several of our aircraft FLL-city had missed that clearance and to please get the word out. Back on the ground, there were no mitigating circumstances for missing the change other than the PDC format. It is my fault we missed the change, period. However, both the First Officer and myself followed Company procedure, checked the PDC and the FMC separately and together. I know that change line is not obvious, is in a terrible spot, is a threat, and look for it specifically. And we still missed it.Until the PDC format changes, this sort of thing is going to continue to occur. As a pilot, I don't care what we were filed for. It is irrelevant, clutters the display, and acts to hide the real clearance. We ONLY care about the real clearance not the filed plan. Remove the filed plan from the PDC. If you can't get rid of the flight plan, at least put the clearance in a concise order of how a human would look at it. The plan first, then cleared departure, then cleared enroute, then cleared arrival. The change does not show up in a logical spot and I have to continually, and specifically force myself to look for it before the plan. It kind of hides from your attention. A short lapse and it gets overlooked. My fault, but why make it like that when it creates error?

The Captain deselected his Push-To-Talk yoke switch from the hot MIC ICS position to get a radio check with ATC. As soon as he did that, ATC reported back loud and clear and that we were the only aircraft they had been unable to check with yet. So, that means we were probably the ones with the hot MIC. There were no other indications of a hot MIC the rest of the flight and we could not duplicate it again no matter how many times the Captain cycled the PTT switch. It is unknown as to how long we had the hot MIC and how much our situation and conversation impacted other ATC communications. This is the third time that I have been a crew member on an aircraft with a stuck MIC. In all of these situations, we were trying to use the PTT yoke switch to improve crew coordination via ICS hot MIC. However, in all of these situations, we, as the flying crew members have had no indication that our switches were stuck somehow activating both ICS and VHF simultaneously. The PTT yoke switch seems to be well intentioned, but poorly engineered. Accelerating the program to replace the communication panels with the hot MIC selector on the center pedestal would be worthwhile in preventing future incidents such as this one. Also, it would be helpful to have either a light on the VHF radio panel or a visual annunciation on the PFD to show that a transmission is taking place.  All of these require money, so in the interim, disabling the PTT hot MIC function might be necessary as well.				B737 First Officer reports receiving an ACARS message that an aircraft on the current ATC frequency has a stuck mic. A radio check by the Captain using his PTT switch clears the problem.

I was the Pilot Flying.  We were landing straight in and we were a little fast so I opted to extend the gear before the flaps.  After the gear was deployed I called for flaps in normal sequence.  We decelerated and the approach was normal.  By my estimation we were going to be stable by 1,000 feet.  When I called for flaps full the autothrust added a lot of power -- it felt like it was going all the way to climb power but I didn't have time to notice the actual N1.  Our airspeed was increasing rapidly towards flap overspeed.  Other than the autothrust behaving abnormally, all other indications were showing that we were flying a normal stable approach path so I pulled the thrust levers to idle to disengage the autothrust.  With me manually controlling the thrust, the plane began to decelerate again and we were stable by 500 feet.  However, in my haste to pull back the thrust levers I accidentally pulled the thrust reverse triggers and put the thrust levers into the reverse position.  I noticed this almost immediately and put the thrust levers back into the idle position.  The reversers did not deploy and we did not receive an ECAM message.  During all this I noticed that my First Officer seemed to be spending more time than normal getting the flap handle into the right position for flaps full.  After we landed I asked my First Officer if he saw anything that would've caused the unexpected thrust increase.  He said that when he reached down to select flaps full, he noticed that the flap indicator showed the flaps at only 1+F rather than 3 (the flap selector was at 3).  When he put the flaps to full, the indicator didn't move so he moved the flap  lever back to 1+F and then quickly re-selected each setting; 1, 2, 3, and full.  He said that the flaps then moved to full.  I didn't see any of this because I was hand flying the plane.  The plane was behaving normally as we went through the configuration changes for landing.  We didn't get any ECAM warnings.  The only abnormality I saw was the increase in thrust.  My First Officer said the thrust increased at the exact second he picked up the flap lever to move it from 3 to full, it happened before he re-selected Flaps 1.  We contacted Maintenance after the flight and had the flaps checked.  They found no defects.It is my understanding that in managed speed and approach mode the autothrust maintains S-speed when flaps are set to 1.  I am pretty sure that the power increased when the flaps went from 3 back to 1.  As Pilot Flying I had no idea that anything was out of the ordinary with the flaps.  When my First Officer reset the flap handle he didn't tell me.  If I would've known that there was an issue with the flaps I would've executed a go around.  I thought we were just seeing an autothrust malfunction or possibly a mode reversion.  Once I had the thrust in manual the aircraft decelerated and we were able to continue the approach normally.  I didn't know there was anything abnormal about the flaps until after we landed.  When we did the Before Landing Checklist I noticed the flaps were in full. This is a normal part of my scan before landing.  As for pulling the thrust levers over the reverse gate -- I did that by instinct.  I rarely fly with manual thrust and when I do I use the match and mash technique (as trained in my last sim session).  This was the first time in the aircraft that I disengaged the autothrust by pulling the levers to idle.  After 5 years of flying the Airbus it's hard to fight the habit of cracking the reverse when pulling the thrust levers from the climb detent back to idle.  All flap lever position changes need to be communicated.  Also, malfunctions on final approach need to be called out.   Final approach is not the place to try to fix a malfunction through a non-standard method.  Also, we need to practice flying with the autothrust off more often.		I was the Pilot Monitoring, flaps where at 3 and I verified they where at 3. Captain called for, 'flaps full Landing checklist.' I responded, 'Speed checked flaps full Landing checklist.' I lifted the flap selector handle and verified flap position, to my surprise they had self retracted to 1+F automatically. The aircraft engine spooled up to meet S speed. The Captain elected to disconnect autothrottles and fly manual due not knowing what was going on. I matched flap position 1+F and reselected each flap to full. Flaps deployed to full ok. On short final I heard a double click and realized that the Captain had turned off autothrottles and had clicked in reverse in flight. It was quickly fixed by him pushing the throttles forward of the gates and we landed soon after. Upon touchdown we received 2 ECAM messages.The events surrounding this are not entirely known. Maintenance met the aircraft and cycled the flaps and slats to verify correct position. Ops checked ok, and ECAM messages where cleared. This aircraft had just come out of C-check and this was the 1st revenue flight for the aircraft. The Captain realized he had clicked into the reverse gates out of habit of doing that on landing, and quickly fixed the issue. I didn't catch his error because I was working on the flaps self retracting to 1+F and the power quickly coming up to increase airspeed to S speed, in addition to me trying to communicate to him the problems that where unfolding. Upon landing, on the return flight, we received the same ECAM messages we had gotten [on the earlier flight], Maintenance was notified.		A320 flight crew reports an unstabilized approach due to a flap anomaly. With the flaps selected to 3 and verified, the flying Captain calls for Flaps Full and the First Officer notes the flap indication to be 1+F. Flaps 1 through Full are reselected by the First Officer with the flaps responding normally. During this time autothrust responds with a large thrust increase and the Captain responds by disconnecting, with thrust levers to idle, then inadvertently selects reverse thrust. This is quickly corrected and the reversers do not deploy.

We were passing over a line of weather below us in level flight at FL400. Ride conditions were light chop with occasional light turbulence. FMC optimum altitude was FL403 and the performance computer enroute page computed 1.48 G available for the flight conditions. Winds had just increased to 95 KTS. We received a RT SIDE Window Overheat and Master Caution light, which we reset in accordance with the QRH. Finishing the QRH procedure, the First Officer (pilot flying) noticed the airspeed decreasing and applied power. I (pilot not flying) noted 35-knot drop/shift in head wind component (220/95 to 220/60). The First Officer applied emergency thrust and disconnected autopilot in accordance with stall recovery procedure. The airspeed continued to decrease to 210 IAS. I attempted to request lower altitude but ATC frequency was congested. We started a descent down to FL380 and airspeed decreased slightly more but stabilized in descent and then slowly increased (momentarily touched yellow arc but no buffet or clacker). Passing through FL390, I was able to get word in to ATC that we were descending and we were cleared to FL380. I reported the large windshear event to them as well. Before leveling at FL380, we had regained normal airspeed and re-engaged autopilot and autothrottles. No aircraft limitations were exceeded and flight continued without further incident. We had no prior alerts or warnings of ride and wind conditions at FL400.  The First Officer (pilot flying) did a good job of recognizing the airspeed decay and applying the high altitude stall procedures including trading altitude for the airspeed when on the backside of the power curve.		Good CRM and crew coordination were key in handling a situation that could have gone bad. Simulator training in high altitude stall awareness/recovery from a prior PC was also very helpful in expedient recognition and recovery.		A B737-700 at FL400 encountered a 35 KT headwind increase which resulted in an airspeed decaying to 210 KTS so the First Officer applied emergency power during a descent, finally getting ATC clearance to FL380.

We held at RADDY with an estimated critical fuel that was right at our limits for whether we would divert or not. At the estimated critical fuel we were given heading in opposite direction and within 10 miles given heading to join arrival. Continued with arrival but had to deviate for weather. We still had plenty of fuel but not enough to shoot approach and land at our alternate with the fuel we wanted so we declared minimum fuel. On downwind for 16R we pulled up a new ATIS and had winds listed as calm. We had already checked landing data reference card and were good for a flaps 30 landing with over 3,000 FT excess runway available based on braking action wet/good. Continued approach and configured for landing. On final noticed that aircraft was having a hard time slowing and going down; first hint. We configured fine then I looked at wind arrow in airplane and it showed a tailwind in excess of ten knots. Asked student Captain to get a wind check and we were given [around] 360/15, gusting to 20. Don't remember exact winds. Thought about flaps 40 but we were below 1,000 FT so we did not reconfigure then thought of landing card check for a tailwind; didn't have time. Storm now seemed to be at end of runway with light rain so I decided to continue approach and landing. We could have made it to alternate with fuel that would have been below my personal minimum, but didn't feel comfortable with a missed with the storm in front and maybe extended vectors to alternate to deviate around weather. Winds may have died off but not sure. [We] touched down fine and aircraft stopped where we planned. We seemed to have thought of everything but we still found ourselves in a position we didn't like. We added more fuel prior to departure. Checked the landing data card, talked about fuel and set our bingo fuel while in holding. But it still got away as we took vectors from Approach. Fuel state was still alright but not what I would have liked. An earlier bingo to alternate would have eliminated any problem.				B737 Check Captain reports being assigned holding then having to declare minimum fuel during vectors for approach. On final below 1,000 FT, winds are noted at 15 KTS gusting to 20 on the tail. With ATIS winds of calm and a storm in the departure path the approach is continued to landing.

We immediately donned our oxygen masks and informed ATC we were performing an emergency descent. The Captain was flying and told ATC we wanted to divert to an airport which was close to our en route position. After completing the QRH, we coordinated with Dispatch and it was determined we were going to land overweight at approximately 134,000 LBS. We declared an emergency with ATC, informed the flight attendants and the passengers. We landed overweight without incident. The emergency personnel standing by inspected the brakes before we continued the taxi to the gate.		[This report contains no additional information.]		A B737-700 Left Pack Tripped Off during climb but reset. It tripped again at cruise, followed by the Right Pack Trip, so an emergency was declared and the flight diverted to a nearby airport.

We were previously on profile so we set the constraint altitude in the MCP and continued with our descent. The local altimeter setting was 30.50 as indicated by ATC and 30.51 (ATIS altimeter setting) was previously entered into the descent planning page in the FMC. As we approached 18,000 FT, we reset our altimeters to the local setting and began the Descent Checklist. Sometime during the execution of the Descent Checklist and our passing of 18,000 FT, the VNAV disconnected and the aircraft was subsequently high on the descent path. As we were very close to our crossing restriction, there was not enough time for manual intervention to be effective and we crossed BEARR 300 to 500 FT high. We were both surprised that the VNAV would disconnect as we were on speed and had verified that the local altimeter setting was entered correctly in the descent forecast page. My suspicion is that the transition to local altimeter-based altitudes for VNAV PATH computation was too abrupt for common VNAV's pathetically narrow window for tracking the computed path. The issue was probably exacerbated when we reset our altimeter settings out of sync with the FMC's transition, which is not visibly evident to the crew. There are serious usability issues with common VNAV due to the lack of salience of mode transitions and the narrow altitude/speed ranges in which the VNAV will track the computed path. I also believe that the common VNAV is somewhat buggy as I have witnessed similar issues where the FMC will suddenly generate a large deviation from the previously computed path to a nearby constraint, to be followed by a VNAV disconnect with minimal time to intervene (e.g., MAIER/EAGLE arrivals into Phoenix). I feel that the use of common VNAV should be re-evaluated. Promoting awareness of this failure mode would also be beneficial.				B737-700 Captain describes a VNAV disconnect descending through FL180 with a high barometric setting that he believes reveals a basic flaw in the B737 auto flight system.

Vibration went away for 10-15 minutes after slowing to M.77. While discussing the event with Maintenance Control and Dispatch the #2 Engine Compressor stalled and significant aircraft yaw/vibration occurred. We reduced #2 thrust lever to idle, declared an emergency and told Dispatch we were heading to a nearby suitable airport. The First Officer took over flying and ATC duties, set up the approach, got ATIS and expeditiously descended to a 10 mile abeam position for landing on [Runway] 14L at the diversion airport. After signing off with Dispatch and Maintenance Control I ran the Engine Stall Checklist, talked to the flight attendants, and passengers, requested landing data, ran the Overweight Landing Checklist and took the controls for a hand-flown visual single engine approach and landing. The #2 Engine had normal indications at idle so we left it running at idle. At around 1,200 AGL, the #2 Engine temperature spiked to hot/max red (didn't see an actual temperature) but we elected to continue the landing rather than run the Overheat Checklist. Fire trucks met us at mid-field; we immediately shut down #2, and were inspected by the fire crew. No indications of fire existed so we taxied to the gate and deplaned passengers. The First Officer did an outstanding job of coordinating the emergency with ATC, descending the aircraft and setting us up for a timely approach and landing, and backing me up throughout the landing. Somewhere in the busyness of it all we got a 'FIRE LOOP B DET FAULT' that flashed for a few moments then went away, and I believe but can't be certain that we also got a momentary Engine #2 fire detection inoperative ECAM that also went away after just a few seconds on the screen. I am curious if we had fire detection during the overheat while landing since the #2 Engine temperature got so hot with no fire indications.		[No additional information was included in the secondary narrative.]		The flight crew of an A320 diverted to the nearest suitable airport following receipt of high vibration indications and compressor stalls from the right engine.

The aircraft was in LNAV and VNAV with the autopilot engaged. At that time, Center cleared us to descend now and maintain FL330, cross ZZZZZ at FL290. I set FL330 in the altitude select window. I entered FL290 into the Flight Management Computer (FMC) on the LEGS page at ZZZZZ and executed the change. I then selected DESCEND NOW from the FMC DESCENT page and executed the command. The path information displayed on the Primary Navigation Display (PND) showed the aircraft approaching path from below. It appeared that it would capture FL330 prior to intercepting the path. I planned to capture FL330 prior to resetting the altitude to FL290. The airplane captured FL330 and I set FL290; but, the airplane did not descend. The path guidance disappeared from the PND and the FMC did not prompt us to reset altitude. I looked at the Flight Management Annunciator (FMA) and it displayed ALT HOLD. I immediately selected LVL CHG. Shortly thereafter--almost simultaneously--Center asked if we were going make ZZZZZ at FL290. Based upon our distance to ZZZZZ and the remaining altitude to lose, I quickly told the Captain that we were going to need relief. He relayed that to Center and the Controller then cancelled our FL290 clearance and instructed us to maintain FL320 informing us of traffic at FL310. We had just barely passed through FL320 with the autopilot still in LVL CHG. I immediately selected ALT HOLD at FL320 or very close to FL320. Center told us to report level, FL320. The autopilot was not arresting the descent and climbing back to FL320 quickly enough. So, we punched-off the autopilot, arrested the descent and initiated a manual climb, but not before dipping to approximately FL314. Simultaneously, Center queried our altitude and told us with apparent anxiety that she needed us to 'expedite' to FL320 and to report level FL320. We reported to her that we were in the climb and expediting. I overshot by about 120 FT but leveled quickly at FL320. We reported level and Center asked, 'What happened there?' We responded that we had stayed at FL330 too long. Nothing further was said; Center then handed-us-off to the next sector. My failure to set FL290 soon enough was due to my lack of altitude planning and awareness other than reliance upon VNAV graphical path depiction. Unlike normally, I didn't back-up VNAV with mental math in this particular occasion. Consequently, I wasn't aware of the inability to meet the restriction until too late. Normally, I would have used VERTICAL SPEED or LEVEL CHG down to FL330. This would have kept me more aware of my distance to ZZZZZ and whether I was high or not. It would have forced me to do the mental math. Upon reaching FL330, I would have re-set a cruise altitude on the cruise alt page, checked the cruise and descent speeds and then re-engaged VNAV. But, this time I elected to stay in VNAV because of the many crossing restrictions and speed limitations on the upcoming complex RNAV STAR. It was supposed to be easier. In retrospect, I should have just set FL290 just after leaving FL370 for FL330. But, I just was not thinking fast enough. Although I did not consider myself unsafe and I believe that I started the day fit for duty, my fatigue increased as the day wore on. At the time of the incident, I believe that my mental ability was less than 100%. I felt as if my mental processes were slowed. I believe that this was a factor in my reliance upon VNAV and a factor in my delayed altitude awareness.				Fatigue played a part when a B737-700 First Officer failed to back up his autoflight mode selections with raw data based mental calculations with respect to a two phase descent clearance from ATC. A traffic conflict resulted requiring the crew to manually override their expedited descent and climb in order to avoid the crossing traffic.

This was approximately 2,000 FT MSL while on a VFR LOC approach. The sidestep was performed normally by me. At approximately 1,000 FT, or slightly lower, I noticed the autothrottles had disengaged for some reason and the airspeed had bled off to approximately 7 or 8 KTS below VREF. I subsequently manually added power and lowered the aircraft nose. The required speed was regained, but the aircraft was slightly high on the glide slope now. I further lowered the nose and was able to get back on path around 500 FT. The landing was normal, if slightly long, after that. A go around maneuver would have been the more prudent decision for this approach.When it was discovered that the autothrottles has disengaged, then a go-around should have been initiated.				A B737-800 autothrottle disconnected on final prior to 1,000 FT but went undetected the until 1,000 FT, about 7 KTS below VRef, and during recovery the aircraft went above glideslope and finally landed long.

Queried First Officer and he too had no forward trim. Only aft trim was available. I elected to maintain present speed and retain the flaps at flaps 1, 220 KTS to avoid major configuration changes which might jeopardize pitch control. ATC quickly allowed us to maintain a lower altitude and assigned a west heading so that we might assess the situation. A review of all switches and circuit breakers gave no clues. There were no cockpit (EICAS or Status) messages or indications. CRM was working well with good input from both First Officers. Our concern was that with only aft electric trim and no down trim we could enter an unsustainable flight condition, so we elected to operate without the autopilot, continuing to hand-fly, to preclude it trimming itself beyond its capability. While working the problem our SAT phone did not work. It kept dropping off while trying to contact Dispatch, going into a low priority Que state. Also, the FMC kept timing out. We elected to dump fuel to landing weight and return to [our departure airport]. We slowly configured to landing, with slow speed changes. The ALT trim worked well. We asked for equipment to standby, and give a quick look to the aircraft when we exited the runway, prior to proceeding to the gate. VHF communication with Tower and Approach was excellent and their response was fast and most helpful. We were granted a long (20 NM) approach and slow approach speed to accommodate a gentle reconfiguration. All went well on approach and landing. During descent, the electric trim seemed to momentarily have some effect; thought the trim indicator did not follow trim input and electric nose down trim resulted in a barely discernible nose down pitch. After an uneventful landing, electric trim appeared to operate normally, with indicator following inputs in both directions. In our post flight review, there were no substantive changes we would have made to our event. Hand-flying was made easier by good crew communication and helpful input. Both First Officers were exemplary in their comportment: Helpful, full of good input, and steadily working the problem to its conclusion.		As Relief Pilot I monitored fuel dumping operations and made annoucements to the passengers and talked to flight attendant crew. Crew coordination was very good and we started the APU just in case of any electrical problems. I did landing data with no speedbrakes since Dispatch could not give us any data via ACARS. The landing was uneventful and fire trucks looked us over with no problems in the flight controls or brakes. We taxied to the gate and had no problems.		After takeoff both B777 yoke controlled nose down trim inputs failed, although the ALT Trim continued to function, so an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

Captain took over the conversation with flight attendants and I assumed control of aircraft and radios. I prepared landing data and got set up for the arrival while the Captain worked with the flight attendants to resolve where the fuel vapor was coming from. First he had them check the overhead bins where the smell was prevalent. Meanwhile he checked the QRH for smoke/fumes. The checklist is set up mostly for electrical events, so we discussed the steps and decided the ones that would probably help considering we had the fuel leak on the #1 engine. We used those steps to turn the left pack and bleed off. The fumes started to dissipate after that. We then ensured all electrical steps were back on and working, and continued our descent and landed without further event.		Approaching top of descent, the flight attendants reported smelling kerosene fumes in the cabin starting about Row 13 and aft. The First Officer and I could not smell anything. I instructed them to check the overhead bins for any fluid that may have spilled. They could find nothing. On the previous leg, a fuel leak on the number one engine was discovered during engine start. The engine was run and the leak found by Maintenance was within serviceable limits. With this in mind while applying the QRH, we elected to turn off the left engine bleed air and left pack and closed the isolation valve. The flight attendants reported about five minutes later, that the smell was dissipating. We landed without further problems. The problem was written up and the aircraft was taken out of service.While the QRH does not specifically address this scenario in the Smoke/Fumes Checklist, we were able to adapt parts of it to shut down the left side of the pneumatic system. If in fact the leak in the No. 1 engine was determined to be the source of the fumes, perhaps an assessment should be made of what is serviceable with regard to what the source of the leak is.		B737 flight crew is informed by the flight attendants that there is a fuel smell in the cabin. Since a fuel leak on the number one engine had been detected prior to departure and deemed to be acceptable by Maintenance, the left bleed and pack are shut down and the smell begins to dissipate. The aircraft is taken out of service after landing.

At one point as we were about five miles from SLIDR, there was a discontinuity after SLIDR and no arrival loaded. I suggested that the Captain at least put the next fix so that we stay on the correct course for the arrival. The Captain didn't want to do this and kept making changes in the CDU. As we passed SLIDR and the plane continued on its heading due to the discontinuity, the Captain then entered the EAGUL 5 on the Arrival page and this time included the GUP transition. The Captain then put GUP in line select L1 position and executed again without verifying with me. GUP was behind us and the plane began making a 180 degree turn back to GUP. I suggested heading mode, but the Captain was still trying to enter it in the CDU. I reached up and selected heading mode while I announced my action and turned the heading toward the next fix which was TINIZ. The Captain then brought TINIZ up to line select L1, executed, and LNAV was re-engaged. Procedures need to be followed that mandate that all entries to the CDU are verified by the other pilot before executing.				B737-700 First Officer reports the Captain making rapid changes to the FMC without waiting for verification before executing. A track deviation occurs on the EAGUL 5 arrival due to an incorrect entry.

This creates a discontinuity on your route flown and will disengage LNAV. This anomaly creates a navigational interruption and is compounded when you receive frequent runway changes. While on the arrival, we were assigned Runway 35C then 35R then back to 35C all west of KARLA intersection. Fortunately, we stayed on the arrival using heading.I believe this discontinuity anomaly when you select a runway should be addressed and revised. But I also suggest in the reduction of runway changes while close to the Airport.		When established on the BONHAM 6 Arrival (BYP.BYP6) and landing North if you put in a runway change it will default to the arrival West of BYP regardless of your position on the arrival. This will create a discontinuity. We were originally assigned ILS 35C by ATC. Within a few minutes they assigned us ILS 35R. A few minutes later they again assigned us ILS 35C. The last two runway assignments were given West KARLA on the arrival. Each time we put the new runway assignment in the FMS it created a discontinuity west on BYP during a critical phase of flight.I would suggest that the arrivals be put in the FMS with the option of a North or South landing. This would allow the arrival to be clean with all points needed to fly the arrival. These points are not associated with any runway assignment. This would allow pilots to make the changes in the box in regard to ATC runway assignment without changing arrival routing.		ATC issued a B737-800 three BONHAM 6 North Arrival runway changes and with each runway change LNAV disengaged and the arrival defaulted to west of BYP which required a complete arrival rebuild for the new Runway 35.

We set up VNAV Path set 1,900 FT in ALT window of Mode Control Panel (MCP). Approaching LUVYN ATC ordered a slow down to 250 KTS. The First Officer who was Pilot Flying deployed speedbrakes and did not think we were slowing fast enough and shallowing our descent fast enough so he selected vertical speed on mode control and slowed sink to slow to 250 KTS. At approximately the same time we had a TCAS FAIL MSG on the ND and XPONDER FAIL LIGHT on the transponder unit. These warning lights help distract me the Captain and Pilot Not Flying at a critical time. We still had 1,900 FT set in the ALT window on the Mode Control Panel from the VNAV path descent for FAF LIMMA. We should have set 10,000 FT in the ALT window for KRAIN once we left VNAV path but failed to do it in time resulting in us going below the 10,000 FT crossing restriction at KRAIN. We corrected back to the path and continued the approach and landing without further problem.		We were being vectored to the arrival and given direct GRAMM with a directed speed of 300 KTS. We were cleared the arrival and placed 1,900 FT in the altitude window. We approached LUVYN and requested a speed reduction to 250 KTS. As we were slowing and descending to the 10,000 FT restriction, the aircraft was in VNAV mode. At 11,000 FT our descent rate was 2,300 ft/min and I felt the aircraft was going to descend through the restricted altitude; I selected Vertical Speed to slow the descent rate, taking us out of VNAV. The restricted altitude was not subsequently put into the MCP altitude window. As I verified the speedbrakes were stowed and VNAV re-selected, I noticed our altitude had descended below 10,000 FT, as was required. I leveled off for the next fix TAROC. We completed the remainder of the approach without any other issues. At this approximate time, we received a TCAS and Transponder malfunction warning, further complicating our work load.		A B737-800 crew flying the RIIVR 2 arrival set 1,900 FT in the MCP ALT for the Runway 25L FAF, then selected VS to begin slowing to 250 KTS at 10,000 FT but became distracted and forgot to re-select VNAV. They descended to 8,500 FT before KRAIN.

I thought that seemed like an odd clearance from Tower, but the First Officer had already switched to Departure. I verified with the First Officer that the Tower had indeed cleared us left to PORTE, started the turn, and asked him to confirm our clearance with Departure. Departure told us to turn left heading 280 and climb to one five thousand. The Departure Controller asked if Tower had given us that clearance. We said yes and he asked what were the words that the Tower Controller used. He then said that was the second time that morning that a crew said they had [received] that clearance and started an early turn. The flight continued uneventfully with no known conflicts. Knowing that was a strange clearance, I feel we should have remained on the published departure and queried the Tower before changing frequencies. Our workload at that critical phase and the fact that the Tower frequency was congested added to the confusion. We are still not sure if the Tower cleared us left to PORTE or used non-standard terminology to clear us left to join the departure. If the Tower wanted us to turn left to join the SFO R350 to SEPDY and remain on the departure, he should have used standard terminology.		We were cleared for takeoff at SFO on 1L on a PORTE Departure. At approximately 500 feet AGL, SFO Tower told us, 'Left turn direct PORTE, climb and maintain 15,000 feet, contact NorCal on 135.1.' I (Pilot Monitoring) thought that was weird, and the Pilot Flying and I looked at each other. When I checked in with NorCal, I told them '1,500 feet for 15,000 feet left turn direct PORTE.' They asked us to roll out on 280 heading and then asked us if we were given that clearance. I read back to him the exact clearance that is mentioned above. He said that was the second time that SFO Tower had given that clearance. Preventative Measures: We complied with a valid ATC clearance. Even though it was unusual, that directive could have been issued to keep us out of conflict with something that we didn't know about. I believe we used good communications skills with NorCal when we checked in to let him know what we were doing since it was a 'out of the ordinary' clearance that we had been given.		Air carrier departing SFO on Runway 1L was confused with regard to the phraseology used by the Tower Controller and the intent of same.

We were number three on the approach.  During the approach, we heard both aircraft in front of us report TCAS RA's over the VNY airport. Both aircraft reported 'climb' RA's.  Both aircraft reported that there was no traffic in sight and ATC reported no conflicting traffic in the area.  There were aircraft at VNY, but well below a TCAS issue.  As we continued towards the runway, we paid close attention to the TCAS display. The only traffic on our display was traffic 2,000 FT below us. As we approached VNY, about one mile prior, a TCAS target popped up with an immediate 'Descend' RA.  At no time was there a TA that we can remember and the traffic showed as +1 and almost immediately on our nose. There would have been almost no possible way to not see something at that position.  I, as the Pilot Flying, disconnected the autopilot to comply with the RA.  We did not see any traffic visually and ATC reported no traffic other than the low traffic at VNY. Although we were pretty confident there was something in the area giving false RA's, we complied as long as we could as we were descending over an active airport. The RA continued for what seemed like a long time even though we were well past any traffic on the display. Due to the location of the event, where we ended up and the fact that the RA was a descend, I decided that a go-around was not prudent due to the terrain north, south, and east of the airport. We were already fully configured for the approach. Once everything went away, we were about 1,500 AGL and about one dot low on the glide path. I leveled off and made the decision to continue to land as that appeared to be the safest course of action based on traffic, our location, and the unknown of what was causing all the RA's for multiple aircraft with no apparent traffic. This whole situation was very strange due to the fact that it happened to multiple aircraft. As the First Officer and I discussed this after the flight, we both agreed that even though the procedure for a RA on approach was a go-around, this situation was somewhat unique and we took the safest action based on what we knew at the time. I think if we had received a 'Climb RA' like the other aircraft, a go-around would have been appropriate. After landing, I called Dispatch and informed them of what happened so they could inform other Burbank arrivals to be aware of the issue.		On visual approach in VMC to Runway 8 at Burbank, we heard the preceding aircraft experience a RA and they initiated a go-around. Then they decided to continue the approach. The discussion with Tower ensued and they described what they had over Van Nuys, but no traffic was sighted by either the aircraft or Tower. Tower told us that the two preceding aircraft received RA's over Van Nuys, but he did not have any traffic to report. We continued the approach and crossed over Van Nuys at 3,000 FT and began down the glideslope. We were paying attention to the TCAS but saw no traffic. Once we started down, we got an RA directing a slight increased descent. I noticed on the TCAS, the traffic was on the First Officer side 200-300 FT lower than us. I looked outside, but could not see any traffic. The Captain increased the descent rate in an attempt to initially comply with the RA. The intruder aircraft now showed 300-500 FT lower than us as we continued our descent. The Captain decided to shallow the descent since we were slightly below the glide path at this time. The next time I noticed the intruder aircraft position on the TCAS, it had moved to 500 below us and was on the Captain's side of the aircraft. Then it disappeared and we never got a 'clear of conflict.' We then continued the visual approach and landed uneventfully. We relayed our experience to Tower. The following aircraft also experienced a TCAS Alert, but did not see any aircraft either. That was four aircraft with false TCAS Alerts on final that we heard of.		B737 flight crew reports a TCAS RA at 3,000 FT over VNY during approach to BUR, but no aircraft is sighted. The two aircraft preceding the B737 and one following also reported TCAS RA's over VNY with no traffic sighted.

We were assigned the Quiet Bridge Visual to 28L. Since this approach is not in the database we asked for the FMS RNAV approach. NorCal said we could fly this but it would have to be to 28L since 28R was closed. We were high at the start of the approach but quickly got closer to the lowest altitudes on the RNAV approach. After descending to the lowest altitude on the approach, about 1,200 FT over the bridge, the Captain switched our approach to the 28L ILS to give me backup navigation since it was night time VFR. At that point the FD kept showing a descent as I was trying to level off at 1,200 FT until the last point on the RNAV (approximately over the bridge). The autothrottles were not adding power even though I was pulling back on the stick trying to level off. This resulted in us descending slightly below the last altitude of 1180 as I was trying to move over to the 28L. At that point I got a 'glideslope' alarm from the aircraft (GPWS). The FD was trying to get me to go lower even though the VASI was showing that I was below the glideslope already. I leveled off and caught both the localizer and glideslope. We landed with no further incident.				A320 First Officer reported several autoflight anomalies on a night visual approach to SFO that, if uncorrected, would have taken the flight into a CFIT situation.

We accepted vectors for the 1R visual. The First Officer disconnected the autopilot somewhere south of the airport in a dogleg turn about 25-30 south. We reported the airport in sight just prior to that point and were cleared for a visual to 1R without other airspeed or altitude clearance. We were at 7,000 feet and 210 knots. I then put 3,500 feet in the altitude window as the First Officer had a reference point in the FMGC to the runway giving us a 3 degree glideslope for reference. I had the 1R RNAV approach plate in front of me and saw that we should have been at 5,000 feet at 10 NM. We were on that profile inside of 15 NM and I spoke with the Tower during this time and noticed we were going to cross the 10 nm point just below 5,000 feet. Before I started to mention it, we received an EGPWS warning 'TERRAIN, TERRAIN, PULL UP, PULL UP'. It lasted about 2-3 seconds. I believe we reached 4,800 feet or slightly above at this time at about 10.5 nm. The First Officer began to start a climb and as we were at level and he put his hands on the levers, the warning stopped after one cycle. There was some sparse green terrain on our displays the entire time and we could visually see our position to it. We stayed at that altitude a few seconds and then continued the approach without further incident to a normal landing. We could not understand the sudden warning as our training always demonstrates this system to work by first advising of a potential conflict and then strengthening in warning until finally commanding a pull up. We got no advisories or other preliminary warnings-just the very sudden pull up, and just as sudden ending of it. There was no corresponding red display as we have seen in the simulator with the aural command. At no time did ATC mention anything about our altitude.		Both the Captain and I operate into LAS frequently and are very familiar with terrain restrictions. We both had 'Terrain' selected on our ND's per SOP. At no time did we lose sight of the airport or surrounding terrain.		A320 flight crew reported receiving a 'Terrain, pull up' warning from the EGPWS on a visual approach to LAS RW 1R that appeared to be inaccurate.

We started getting multiple ECAMs and the First Officer told me to take the aircraft as he had lost all flight instruments and displays. I took control and at about the same time the autopilot disengaged with a Master Warning, auto-thrust disengaged leaving THR LK on my FMA, #2 EPR gage in yellow with X's. The cockpit lights were flashing on and off and there was a loud clicking towards the back of the cockpit which sounded like the solenoid on the door lock. We immediately started the APU. We had ECAMs for #2 EPR mode inop, ELAC 2 inop, SEC 2 inop, SEC 3 inop, FAC 2 inop, Cab Sys 1 inop, cargo smoke detect fault inop, SDCU detect inop, the ECAM lower SD system display was blank except for a diagonal line, and overhead on the ADR panel the 'ON BAT' light was illuminated. Additionally we lost communications with the cabin crew. They were calling us with their call button and pounding on the cockpit door but we couldn't respond immediately as the interphone was inop. I flew the aircraft while the First Officer diligently worked the ECAMs in sequence but we kept getting repeat ECAMs and it became apparent the FWC was taking us in endless circles and there must be a bigger problem the FWC is not picking up. At this point it seemed obvious we had major problems and should land as soon as possible. I declared an emergency with Center and started a descent. Next we pulled up the system pages and noticed the #2 Gen was showing red with volts about 80 and freqs about 120. Evidently the GCU for the #2 gen was not forcing a protection trip and we never got a gen fault light or ECAM for such. With the APU running we elected to deselect the #2 gen allowing the APU gen to pick up A/C bus 2 rather than using gen #1 possibly contaminating A/C bus 1 and our only 2 remaining flight control computers.  This seemed to slowly clear up most of our problems. Still, the First Officer had no ND, the lower SD system display was still inop and we still had 4 flight control computers faulted. We were concerned about the 4 inop flight control computers so we decided to slowly and carefully reset each one at a time. We got all flight control computers back on line. With the aircraft under control we briefed the flight attendants (TEST) and passengers on our divert and then contacted Dispatch connecting with Maintenance Control as well. Maintenance advised he had been receiving a large volume of downloaded faults from our aircraft and we should land as soon as possible. We accomplished the divert items listed in the FOM and Dispatch sent us weights for landing. ATC was very accommodating and we made an uneventful overweight landing per checklist. Emergency equipment was standing by but not needed. After landing we debriefed with everyone and elected to take another Airbus on to destination 2 hours later. The next leg was uneventful.		In cruise at FL320, multiple ECAMs starting appearing, cockpit lighting was flashing, door lock clicking, AP and AT disconnected. First Officer PFD and ND as well as lower eng display blanked out. I handed Pilot Flying duties to the Captain as I had no instrumentation. Main ECAMs were ELAC2/SEC2+3/FAC2, cargo smoke fault, cab sys 1 fault, IRU on bat light was on. ECAMs were cycling through with the aforementioned ELAC/SEC/FAC fault lights flashing. Cabin interphone was inop. Both engine EPR gauges showed XX. Attempted to run ECAM however it was cycling fast so was hard to do. Followed ECAM which had me reset ELAC/SEC/FAC, no help. Both engines were put, per checklist into N1 mode. #2 engine did not seem to respond well to throttle inputs. Captain declared the emergency. We started APU but did not help the problem. I looked at the ELEC page and saw that GEN2 showed red and HZ/V seemed abnormal.I showed the Captain and I suggested that we disconnect the gen, he agreed. As soon as the gen was disconnected the light show and multiple ECAMs stopped. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control, we agreed that diverting was the safest course of action and diverted. Accomplished the overweight landing checklist as we were at 148,000 lbs, uneventful landing. Fire trucks met us, no further action was required.		A320 flight crew experiences loss of the First Officer's flight displays along with autopilot and autothrust disconnects in night IMC at FL320. ECAMS were displayed for #2 EPR mode inop, ELAC 2 inop, SEC 2 inop, SEC 3 inop, FAC 2 inop, Cab Sys 1 inop, cargo smoke detect fault inop, SDCU detect inop, the ECAM lower SD system display was blank. The APU is started and the number two generator is deselected allowing most systems to return to normal. Flight diverts to a suitable airport.

We had programmed 28R into the FMC and the aircraft was descending in VNAV PATH and on profile. Winds aloft were loaded in Descent Forecast page. Approaching CUTTA, ATC changed our runway to 32. This requires re-loading the runway because 28R and 32 have different paths after KIRKK. Both of us pulled out the 32 approach plate and got it loaded in the FMC. Somewhere in this sequence of events, the aircraft ['s FMS mode] changed to SPEED and went high on profile. We were at 261 knots so I told the First Officer (Pilot Flying) to increase descent rate to make CUTTA at 10,000 feet. He pushed the nose over and made a good effort at recapturing PATH, but we ended up 800 feet high over CUTTA.[To prevent this in the future,] whenever the runway or the approach is changed, one pilot must continue monitoring the progress. Once one of the pilots has retrieved the necessary charts, he can resume monitoring. Also, not sure what caused the aircraft to come out of PATH but may have been higher than forecast winds during descent. This time of year winds are stronger and the descent page must be monitored.				Distracted while reprogramming their landing runway from 28 to 32 as they were descending into PIT on the JESEY RNAV STAR and cleared cross CUTTA at 10,000, the flight crew of a B737NG failed to note their autoflight mode had reverted from VNAV to speed and their rate of descent had decreased commensurately.  They crossed CUTTA 800 feet high.

Controller transmitted '[Our call sign] stop the climb at 340' As I was about to key the mike to acknowledge, another aircraft with a very similar call sign acknowledged. The Captain and I assumed that the call was for this other aircraft, but just to be sure I queried the Controller and asked, 'Who was that for?' The Controller responded hastily and with a rather annoyed tone, 'He got it!' So, assuming that the call was for the other aircraft, we continued the climb and leveled at FL350. Less that a minute later, the Controller transmitted '[Our call sign], turn 35 degrees left immediately!' I acknowledged the directive and we did so. The Controller then asked, 'Did you hear the clearance to level off at 340?' I told him, 'Someone else answered for us, I asked you to repeat the call sign, and you told me 'he got it'' The Controller then said, 'Okay, no problem.' Nothing more was said of the incident by the Controller.		On climbout west of TXK were given a clearance to climb to FL350. At approximately FL330 the Controller gave a clearance to climb to FL340 which we believed was intended for our aircraft; however another aircraft took the clearance. We asked the Controller who that last clearance was for and was told the correct aircraft got it. We continued the climb to FL350. At FL350 we were asked by the Controller if we had gotten the revised clearance to FL340. We responded that we had asked but were told the correct aircraft had gotten the clearance.The frequency was busy, however I believe that if we had used our call sign in our query instead of 'Who was that for' and if the Controller had used our call sign in his response instead of 'The right aircraft got it' we would have avoided the problem.		B737 flight crew reports another aircraft accepting a clearance to level off at FL340 that was meant for them. When ATC is queried about whom the clearance was for ATC responds that the correct aircraft got the clearance.

Upon checking in with SCT Approach, we were cleared for the ILS 25L. Prior to changing approaches in the FMS, the MCP was set in VNAV PATH at 10,000 FT. Once the ILS 25L was set in the FMS, I set 1,900 FT in the altitude window to allow a descent on the approach profile. Just prior to KRAIN at approximately 9,600 FT, we were attempting to brief the [Runway] 25L approach when ATC told us to level at 9,000 FT and said we were supposed to cross KRAIN at 10,000 FT. We acknowledged and were then cleared to continue the approach. We were subsequently cleared for the visual approach and landed with no further event. When last-minute runway changes are made, correct altitude and MCP settings must be verified prior to descending below any crossing restrictions and briefing the new approach.

On the first leg from XXX, the OPC was correctly programmed resulting in a max power takeoff. All ground ops at our next departure airport were normal resulting in a reduced power takeoff on Runway 19L. Upon reaching cruise, something jarred my memory about the requirement to perform a max power takeoff with an inoperative thrust reverser. I then reviewed the OPC again and found out for some reason the MEL button was no longer highlighted. It was my belief that once an MEL had been selected on the OPC that it would be retained for subsequent use. We then began a trial and error with the OPC along with a review of the manual to determine what could have possibly happened. During this exercise, we discovered that during the OPC programming on the ground at our first stop the Onboard Performance System page had been selected when going from landing data to takeoff data versus just selecting the Module menu page. This resulted in the MEL being dropped. Although this was a programming error, I still should have caught the MEL not being highlighted. We talked numerous times on the first leg about the thrust reverser, especially on landing, but for some reason we both completely missed the reduced takeoff commanded by the OPC for our subsequent departure.We get MELs so infrequently; especially ones that require OPC input. My [limited] knowledge on how the OPC retains MELs may have made me a little complacent on what the OPC provides us. We were on top of the MEL the first leg but failed to follow through with the same diligence for the second.		In reviewing how I set up the OPC, it was determined that to return to the main page to enter the second takeoff data, I pressed the stylus button and pressed return. This brought me to the main performance page on the OPC. Unfortunately, this also removes the previously selected MEL from the OPC. I was under impression the OPC retained this information UNTIL deselected as stated in the FRM. The OPC does retain the MEL if you use the Module Menu page, but it does not retain the MEL if you do as I did. We did not notice the MEL had been removed.In reading the MEL, it did not mention that a max power takeoff is required. This is fine considering the OPC, when properly programmed, will calculate the proper takeoff thrust; however, this is the first time I have seen this particular MEL and I was used to seeing restrictions also stated in the paper MEL.		Dispatched with an inoperative left engine reverser the flight crew of a B737-700 computed their takeoff performance utilizing the onboard computer with the relevant MEL item selected and the result required a maximum thrust takeoff due to the MEL. On the next leg the computing process was initiated in a different fashion, the MEL dropped out of memory, and the computer provided takeoff numbers predicated on reduced thrust. The error was not discovered until at cruise on the second leg.

Number 2 was still having NAV engaged and Number 2 autopilot still engaged. We advised Maintenance and elected not to continue with the reset till we are closer to our destination airport for fear of losing Number 2 System completely with no Auto Flight capabilities.

In short, I missed it and forgot it was there. We were correcting when the Controller called us asking for our speed and were slowing from 290 to 280 KTS. The cost index was 99 and programmed for a 320 descent and we caught it around 290 just before the Controller noticed our closure on preceding aircraft.

In anticipation of challenges associated with the new traffic flow at ORD, we thoroughly briefed possibilities and contingencies for an arrival as early as Denver.  We programmed an arrival to Runway 28C (new runway) as the Pilot Bulletins and NOTAMs indicated this was the new arrival runway.  This was further reinforced by the Chicago Dispatcher's notes on the SABRE Flight Plan that indicated 28C was the expected landing runway. We discussed the BENCKY2 arrival and reviewed all of the step downs and speed restrictions. We did consider that we might be assigned a different runway, as 28C, 27L and 27R were all in use.  But, as per SOP's, we briefed only one runway until assignment, 28C, with the caveat that we would brief the new runway if changed. While descending at 300 KTS assigned, ATC modified all of the fix altitudes and speeds on the BENCKY2.  We programmed these initially without problem. When ATC offered a new altimeter, I announced I would be getting a new ATIS. While using the Misc AS (COMM) function to obtain ATIS, the system locked up. I tried twice, trying to get a SEND prompt. My FMS then went into standby mode, which I announced to the flying First Officer. She would have to enter her own crossing restrictions, while I obtained new ATIS via radio. We were assigned Runway 27L at a point I believe was approaching ASHTIN. While programming the new runway on Autopilot, the plane began to make a hard right turn, as if it were returning to BENCKY2. First Officer disengaged AP and manually corrected back to track. During this we were in weather, at night, flying the requested higher speeds and descending to 9000 feet. We inadvertently maintained the higher speed to 9000, correcting prior to level off. Here is where I introduced further error into the operation. I made an incorrect inference that the north prong of the BENCKY2 arrival served both north (27R, 27L) runways. The FMC would not (and properly so) offer the north fork routing to Runway 27L. While struggling with this misinterpretation, Approach Control (thankfully) issued a vector.  At some earlier point, I should have asked for a vector and speed, but in an effort to be helpful to O'Hare's new runway flow, I tried to keep on task with programming.  To further our contrition, ATC admonished us for not responding to their calls, which was deserved as we were trying to figure out what the FMC was trying to do. I believe the following are the contributing factors. The BENCKY2 Arrival has myriad fixes and speed and altitude constraints, including at and above and below at BYLAW. Both the First Officer and I generally fly the Pacific and though we welcomed the change to domestic, it presents its own new challenges. The FMC dropping into standby mode during this busy arrival began the sequence of events, which I did not handle well. The high speed assignments, altitude variations, weather, and errant FMC were all contributing.  I must state that this failure was not for a lack of effort, or any disrespect for ATC, as we planned early. It was a chain of circumstances that ultimately led to the deviations. I accept full responsibility for these deviations, and in review the only thing I would do differently is: Get a better understanding of the last section of the BENCKY2 and ask ATC for a vector despite their busy controlling.  I thought Approach, with the exception of a late runway assignment (which may be beyond their control), though terse, handled their end very well.		On descent into Chicago, O'Hare on the BENKY 2 RNAV Arrival, we had a minor flight path deviation and delay in slowing to 250 knots below ten thousand feet.Due to anticipating an involved RNAV arrival with multiple speed and step-down restrictions, landing on new Runway 28C, and newly imposed taxi-flow procedures we began reviewing and briefing for the approach as early as Denver. Our brief, as per SOP, was in anticipation of landing on 28C; however we did discuss the possibility of a runway change to 27R or 27L. I, as the Pilot Flying, also briefed that I would be using the autopilot on the STAR to reduce workload during the arrival. Anticipated weather conditions were night, light rain, quartering crosswind of approximately 15-20 knots on landing.Prior to BDF we were assigned 300 knots and two modified altitude restrictions prior to BENKY. We crossed BENKY at 12,000 feet and 300 knots as requested. Inside NEWRK, ORD Approach issued a new altimeter setting. When the Captain attempted to get the ATIS via ACARS it locked up and the SEND command became frozen. It required him to get the ATIS via VHF. I believe it was near ASHTN that we were assigned Runway 27L. Several things occurred at this point. When attempting to re-program the FMC to 27L the aircraft made a hard right turn over PETAH as if returning to BENKY. As the Pilot Flying, it required disconnecting the autopilot to make an aggressive turn back toward PETAH. The Captain informed ATC we were turning back toward PETAH which ATC acknowledged. In addition, during this time period and for no apparent reason, the FMC went into STANDBY mode. I was descending to nine thousand feet and it was the last thousand feet to nine thousand that I realized I was late slowing to 250 knots.The Captain and I both erroneously believed we were to head north toward KURKK for the 27 runways. It was at this point while the FMC was in standby mode that ATC issued direct MONKZ. Shortly after being given a vector and I believe after a frequency change, ATC told us we had missed a couple of their radio calls. Once on vectors and the FMC out of STANDBY mode, we extended 27L and landed uneventfully.I believe the contributing factors were:-Multiple ATC altitude and speed adjustments to the BENKY2 RNAV arrival. -VNAV having difficulty keeping up with 300 knot descents on a RNAV arrival.-ACARS and FMC malfunction including difficulty programming.-Late runway assignment requiring FMC program changes over a waypoint (PETAH) that forks into two different directions for different runways.-Standard taxi flow instructions not readily available on 10-7 or 10-9 pages.-Unfamiliarity with new O'Hare runway flow procedures.		A B777 crew describe their difficulty reprogramming the BENCKY 2 RNAV after a runway change from the planned 28C to 27L when the FMC and ACARS both temporarily malfunctioned which required ATC vectors.

Configuration and sequencing looked good until the Pilot Flying cut downwind off to a tight base. I made a challenge that we were high on base. The Pilot Flying acknowledged. We were not stabilized at a thousand feet so as Pilo Monitoring, I directed a go-around. The PF carried the approach a couple hundred feet more and satisfying his curiosity, he initiated the go-around. I notified Tower and we were assigned a climb to 8,000 FT and a turn to 310 degrees. We were then given a visual to Runway 8. I set the NAVAIDs up and made the modifications to the MCP. Stable on the downwind, I updated the box. Tower asked for the reason for the go-around and, after I answered, he gave us the option to use Runway 3. I asked the Pilot Flying which runway he preferred and he said Runway 3 as that was the runway he thought we were going to anyway. I reset the MCP and NAVAIDs, and updated the box. As he was hand flying, I went to set his Course Select window, which he asked me not to. The go-around maneuver was smooth and deliberate, but I was surprised that after Tower assigning Runway 8 and the change of the MCP and NAVAIDs, which I recall verbalizing, that the PF felt a bit out of the loop as to aircraft setup. The second approach was established at 1,000 FT and a nice landing was made.A go-around causes a lot of activity and in the case of a directed go-around, the Pilot Flying is not always focused on what will happen but is still thinking about what has happened. I should be more careful on the set, acknowledge, and verify the sequence to make sure everyone is staying up with the progress of the aircraft.				A B737-700 First Officer executed a go-around from an unstabilized approach to ABQ Runway 3 and was assigned Runway 8 but preferred Runway 3 for the second successful approach.

We pushed off of Gate and took off on Runway X.  Prior to takeoff I notified the flight attendants with a 'ding' and observed their response, over the PA, that we had been cleared for takeoff and completed the Before Takeoff Checklist.  As expected, we encountered light turbulence during the climbout to cruise altitude.  Passing FL350, the flight attendants 'dinged' us and asked us if it would be OK if they got up.  At this point they informed me that they had not completed the oxygen demo briefing and that they would like to get up and do it.  I agreed that yes it needed to be completed and they did.  I said that we would talk about what had happened and why when we landed.  Once in (city), I asked them what had happen.  They said that in the middle of their briefings some passengers required some attention and put them behind.  It took six minutes from pushback to takeoff.  Once they had the situation solved, I 'dinged' them and they agreed amongst themselves that they would complete the oxygen demo brief after takeoff and below 10,000 feet.  I didn't know we could do that, but they said they could.  At that point they made the cleared for takeoff brief signaling to me that they had completed their cabin preparation and were ready for takeoff.  After hearing their story, I explained to them that 1) had they continued the oxygen demo brief after I 'dinged' them, I would have known they were not ready and would have delayed the takeoff; or 2) don't make the cleared for takeoff briefing and contact the flight deck and let us know that they required additional time to prepare the cabin due to some passenger issues.Although the First Officer and I were unaware of the situation until passing FL350, this event could have been avoided if the flight attendants had a better understanding of our procedures and if the pilots were more consistent in applying the Before Takeoff Checklist.  As I explained to the flight attendants their options prior to the event, why we 'ding' them and what we expect to hear to continue with the takeoff, they said that they didn't believe that all pilots would have waited for them to complete their duties.  They felt or believed that some pilots just hit the call button and takeoff without even monitoring the PA.  So possibly a Crew Briefing Bulletin emphasizing our before takeoff crew procedures and the importance of the flight attendants' duties being completed prior to takeoff and the pilots verifying that they have been completed.		[Narrative #2 contains no additional information.]		A B737 took off after a six minute taxi during which time flight attendants handling a passenger issue were unable to complete the oxygen demo and because of turbulence remained seated until FL350 when the oxygen demo was finally completed. The flight attendants failed to notify the Captain about the oxygen demo situation until cruise.

Coincidently, the aircraft began leveling at FL290 and the autothrottles began retarding from climb to cruise thrust.  Two loud pops were heard with momentary ECAM displays of ENG1 stall and ignition-on.  The Pilot Monitoring announced ECAM and split cockpit duties as the warnings extinguished.  He checked engine parameters and found that they indicated normal.  The Lead Flight Attendant called via interphone to ask about the source of the noise.  The Pilot Monitoring explained the situation to the Lead and followed up with a PA to explain the source of the noise to concerned passengers.  Following the PA the Lead called again and announced that the left engine was on fire.  The Pilot Monitoring asked the Lead to confirm the fire visually as there were no indications in the cockpit and the condition had evidently been reported by passengers.  The Pilot Monitoring completed the Approach Descent Checklist and pushed the ECAM recall button which returned a NORMAL.  The Lead called back reporting that there was no fire, just flashes of fire associated with the loud pops.  The Pilot Monitoring directed the Lead to station a crew member in position to monitor engine 1 visually and provide reliable information.  As, Pilot Flying, I continued with radio duties as the Pilot Monitoring looked up and sent the appropriate Maintenance code.  Duties were then returned to normal and shortly after Center directed a descent to FL200.  I pushed the altitude knob to begin a managed descent and as the autothrottles reduced thrust another loud pop was heard with ENG1 Compressor Stall ECAM.  The Pilot Monitoring split the duties in the cockpit and proceeded with the ECAM checklist.  Per the Pilot Monitoring's direction, as Pilot Flying, I matched throttle position to EPR indication, disengaged the autothrottles and retarded no. 1 throttle to flight idle.  The ECAM disappeared and the engine returned to normal indications.  Satisfied the condition of the no.  1 engine was stable, the Pilot Monitoring, declared an emergency reporting, souls on board, endurance and asked for CFR support at our destination.  The Pilot Monitoring made a PA followed by another call from the Lead reporting an engine fire.  When asked to verify the report the Lead indicated that the stationed crewmember confirmed no current visible evidence of fire.  The Captain, Pilot Monitoring, briefed the Lead to expect a normal landing using a TEST briefing.  As Pilot Flying, I communicated our desire for an ILS guided visual approach and complied with vectors and descent guidance as the Pilot Monitoring communicated our situation via ACARS to Dispatch.  Passing approximately 16,000 feet, the Pilot Monitoring returned cockpit duties to normal, was told by Approach to expect ILS 25R and immediately began reprogramming the MCDU for the new runway.  As Pilot Flying, I continued to fly the airplane and the Pilot Monitoring briefed the new approach.  Approach, landing and rollout were uneventful.  CFR followed us to the gate to assure no further support was necessary.  The Captain called the Maintenance Engine Controller to report the incident and indications.  Cursory post-flight inspection of visible engine components revealed no damage.  After leaving the aircraft, the Captain also received a phone call from the FODM to recap the evening's events.		I gave the aircraft and radios to the Pilot Flying and was preparing to do the ECAM procedures when the engine stabilized, the ECAM went away, autoignition went off and all engine parameters were normal. We kept the cockpit split and I took the first call from the Purser and he told me the engine was 'on fire' and I asked him, 'Still?' because we had no indications of fire in the cockpit. I asked him to go back and make sure. During this time I asked for the Maintenance Code book and started to write up the malfunction and what we had observed when the Purser called back to tell me that the passengers on the left side of the plane and behind the wing had seen flames shoot out of the engine at the time of the loud bangs but there was no fire at this time. The Pilot Flying suggested having a flight attendant keep watch for the duration of the flight instead of relying on a passenger and I made this request which was acknowledged. I completed entering the maintenance write up but noted on the ACARS response that the code I used indicated that we had shut the engine down which was not the case. I finished the Approach Descent Checklist and was about to correct the mistake when we received a clearance to descend to FL200. At that time I felt we should focus on flying and we went back to Pilot Flying, Pilot Monitoring SOP and put the cockpit back to 'normal' figuring I'd correct the Maintenance reporting gaff in descent. I set FL200 in the altitude window, we verified and the Pilot Flying pushed the altitude select button to begin a managed descent. When the autothrottle pulled the thrust back we immediately got another single loud bang, large EPR swings on engine 1, autoignition and the ECAM. Again, we went into standard ECAM procedures and split the cockpit duties and just as I was having a look at the ECAM procedure it all went away at the stabilized reduced trust for the managed descent. One of the things I had noticed on the procedure was to turn off the autothrust and reduce thrust. The Pilot Flying turned off the autothrust in an air manlike manner and gently pulled the engine 1 thrust lever to idle with no further compressor stalls. While he was doing that I fielded another volley of calls with the Purser exactly like the first series only this time I gave him TEST and told him we were declaring an emergency, proceeding to our destination and to expect a normal landing with equipment rolling next to us. We discussed the decision to continue as the best course of action and to leave channel nine on with a PA com to the passengers. I declared an emergency with Center, souls and 1:20 fuel (6200+ lbs) with a request for equipment as precautionary and that we expected a normal landing, rollout and to exit the runway on our own. We were cleared direct the airport and I made a PA to the passengers that covered all of the above and when we would be landing. At this time, we stayed split cockpit and I notified Dispatch via ACARS of all of the above and corrected the MRM mistake by telling him that we had a DEGRADED engine and that it WAS NOT shut down which was acknowledged by 'COPY ALL.' We also made sure our QRH's were handy and contemplated the possibility of an evacuation. We put the cockpit back together and continued our descent with engine 1 at idle and all parameters normal. When we transitioned through FL180 we were switched to Approach and were given the ILS and we asked to be vectored onto the approach as opposed to taking a visual for terrain considerations. We were downwind and south of the field. We split the cockpit one more time and I installed the approach and briefed the Pilot Flying from my plate and handed it to him for review and briefly took the airplane. When we were both satisfied with our situational awareness we went back to Pilot Flying, Pilot Monitoring SOP. The remaining approach and landing with engine 1 at idle thrust were completely normal and we asked for a fire truck to follow us to the gate which he did. We post flighted the number 1 engine and saw no outward signs of damage and I called the Engine Controller to give him our perspective. The Maintenance Manager called to close the loop and we proceeded to the layover hotel.		An A320 left engine experienced two compressor stalls at cruise: first when thrust was reduced to set cruise power and when reduced again to begin the descent. The QRH was completed, an emergency declared and the flight continued to its filed destination with both engines operating.

Previous ATIS showed seven knots of tailwind. We discussed this with each other and queried Tower. They advised new ATIS and calm winds. We commented among ourselves that probably at 100 FT AGL the tailwind would still be there. Typical heavy departure procedures that you regularly get in PHX and LAS ATC asks you to verify previous departure in sight and clears you for takeoff as the previous departure is lifting off. Previous departure was a B737-700 with a west departure. We had a normal takeoff roll and rotation. As I retracted the gear, the airplane started a violent roll to the right. The First Officer applied full opposite aileron. I pushed the yoke forward and simultaneously said 'push the nose down'. The airplane started to reduce bank and climb normally. By this time we were over the parallel taxiway east of [Runway] 1R correcting heading and noticing that LNAV had failed and we couldn't restore it. The First Officer flew raw data on the map until we were able to restore LNAV shortly after. We also noticed a big white flashing box around the engine instruments' indications showing oil quantity low and depleting. It wound up being a classic case of oil gulping for the Number 1 Engine, but it was eye opening with all the other occurrences. The engine oil indication started [to] replenish 30 to 40 seconds later. We continued to climb and landed uneventfully. We had two inquiries regarding the departure, one from our A Flight Attendant who noticed the unusual attitude, and a couple from passengers in the back of the aircraft, one of whom was a private pilot and asked if we encountered wake turbulence. The First Officer was at the controls the entire time and did an excellent job of recovering from the wake turbulence. Preventative Measures: The obvious is that we could have delayed takeoff and left more spacing. ATC could do the same. The reality is that they are trying to move metal as quickly as we are and both of us are mission-oriented. The preceding airplane was not a heavy so they and we complied with all procedures. It is apparent to me that the B737-700 wing produces a more significant wake vortices than other models. I don't know if it's because of wing shape or the heavier gross weights the aircraft is capable of taking off at. Some consideration should be given to researching the actual wake the airplane produces and coordinating departure spacing with ATC accordingly.				B737-700 Captain reported a 'violent' wake vortex encounter after takeoff at LAS in trail of another B737-700. He commented that the -700 seemed to have more significant wake than other aircraft and perhaps in-trail considerations should be reviewed when the -700 is involved.

Only after we were through deviating did I discover the GAIN on the weather radar was just out of the auto position, resulting in a MIN GAIN setting. The real issue, and the reason for the report, is that the CAL indication on the Map Display showing the GAIN was in MAN was masked by the airports also being displayed. The font and color of the two are nearly identical, making identification of the GAIN setting easily missed/masked. The hazards of being in MIN GAIN and not knowing are self-evident. The font and/or color of the radar status should be modified so as not resemble that of the airports on the map display.				B737 Captain reports not being able to detect obvious thunderstorms on the aircraft radar. The storms are avoided visually and it is later discovered that the gain is set to MIN instead of Auto.

ATC provided many speed assignments to 'keep our speed up.'  While transitioning from a managed descent to the approach mode, we briefly failed to observe the subtle changes to the FMA's that indicated a mode reversion to our VNAV profile.  It would be helpful to have a more noticeable and audible alert when a reversion occurs.		Approaching FUELR on approach into LAX having transitioned to 25L approach from River 2 arrival, crew did not recognize in a timely fashion a reversion from managed descent mode. Pilot Monitoring alerted Pilot Flying descending through restriction but with rate of descent final level off occurred 500 feet below 7,000+ restriction. Managed descent was re-engaged and next restriction, 6,000+ was made.		A320 flight crew reports descending below the FUELR crossing restriction on the ILS 25L approach to LAX when the aircraft transitions to approach mode from LNAV/VNAV without the crew noticing. The crew detects the error and the remainder of the restrictions are met.

While on the approach, we noticed the discontinuity had reappeared. I said that I would give him directions if we needed to go missed and not to follow the LNAV.We went through MCI a second time this day, and still needed to shoot the ILS approach.

Vectors for EGLL Runway 27R. Cleared to descend to 6,000 FT. FLCH mode used with right autopilot engaged. Transition altitude 6,500 FT. Captain reset altimeter to 1006 Hp leaving 7,400 FT. First Officer did not reset altimeter to QNH until just prior to 6,000 FT. Airplane descended below 6,000 to approximately 5,700 FT with autopilot engaged. Once discovered by Captain, First Officer disengaged autopilot and climbed back to 6,000 FT. EGLL Director did not acknowledge or indicate observation of deviation. Ensure all altimeters are reset to QNH in descent 1,000 FT prior to transition altitude if clearance is below transition.		We were on downwind turning base to Runway 27R at EGLL. We were cleared from FL080 to 6,000 FT with an altimeter of 1006. The transition level was 6,500. I was flying with the autopilot on and selected FLCH to descend to 6,000 FT. We were in the turn to base when I saw BAROSET DISAGREE on the EICAS screen. The Captain had already selected 1006 on his altimeter so I pushed mine from STD to 1006. This was around 6,400 FTto 6,300 FT. We got a caution alert and I saw ALTITUDE ALERT on the EICAS SCREEN. I looked at the altimeter and it showed us 300 FT low (5,700 FT) so I immediately disengaged the autopilot and pulled the nose back up. The altitude 6,000 FT was in the altitude capture window and we were in FLCH. I couldn't understand why it didn't capture it. My guess is that I selected 1006 on the altimeter while it was transitioning to the capture mode and it disrupted the normal automation. ATC did not mention the excursion.I should have selected 1006 right after FLCH going from FL080 to 6,000 FT. The low altimeter setting made the Transition Altitude 6,500 FT that day so I needed to hit it faster. I was monitoring a descent, speed change, my time to the runway, and general visual field orientation and my cross check missed the lack of altitude capture. The B777 is so reliable that I was over confident in letting it back me up. This is a side note and had happened to me once before several months earlier. I was descending to 6,000 FT where 6,000 was the transition level. I switched the altimeter from standard to local just prior to 6,000 FT and it didn't capture the altitude that time either but I was watching it and leveled off at 6,000 FT. We discussed it then and guessed that it might have been because I selected it while it was capturing the altitude. It might be worth asking Boeing if this is a possibility.		B777 flight crew reports descending below their assigned altitude due to the altimeter setting being changed by the flying First Officer from QNE to QNH just as the aircraft is leveling at 6,000 FT. The aircraft levels off 300 FT low on QNH and is immediately returned to 6,000 FT.

The rollback was rough, like a cough, and was noticeable through both N1 gauge indication and aircraft feel. During the rollback, the autothrottles disengaged. As PF, I slightly reduce power on Number 2 as the engine stabilized and started to recover to normal power. No malfunction indicators or messages were received. The engine operated normally for the remainder of the flight. The SAT was approximately -58 degrees and the anti-ice was off. At the time we were deviating around radar returns for weather, but were not in any rain, turbulence, or dense clouds. We couldn't really tell the thickness of the weather because it was still dark. Shortly before the event, I had turned on the wing lights to check for icing and the wings were clear. Suggest investigation of potential high altitude, low temperature (below -40 SAT) engine icing.				B737-700 First Officer experiences an engine rollback at FL400 to 60% N1, then a slow recovery. High altitude low temperature internal engine icing is suspected.

This caused the airplane to climb 500 feet above altitude. As soon as the engines started to spool, I informed the Captain that we were about to start climbing out of our assigned altitude. He was not sure what to do, as he started pushing buttons to get the airplane to level off. After a few moments of letting him try to solve the solution, I asked him to turn off the autopilot, which he eventually did, and returned the aircraft to its intended flight path. He completed the visual approach with a slight overshoot. I should have intervened right away, instead of waiting for him to figure out the automation. I'll be less respectful of positional authority, and more respectful of the possible consequences.		We were at 5,500 feet on a base leg flying a visual approach. I intended to arm the VOR/LOC mode on the MCP. However, I accidentally armed the APP mode. The autopilot then captured a glideslope signal. The aircraft quickly began to climb. This resulted in a 500 foot deviation error. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and corrected the flight path.Correctly verbalizing and verifying automation changes would prevent this error.		Inadvertently selecting APP mode vice VOR/LOC to intercept the localizer while on autopilot resulted in a glide slope capture and a climb out of their cleared altitude for a B737NG flight crew.

I was one of two relief pilots on this flight and I cannot specifically recall if I was in the first observer's seat or second observer's seat. I also do not recall which pilot was the pilot flying or which the pilot monitoring on this flight. I had no recollection of this event until I reviewed the maintenance history of the aircraft which jogged my memory somewhat. I recall that there was an issue with the FMC and that its response based on programmed entries was not expected by the crew. I believe one or more crew members immediately commented so that immediate correction was made, but not before the exceedance. The Captain wrote up the discrepancy upon arrival at the gate. Obviously, I/we should have immediately associated this with an event requiring an ASAP report.I believe [the cause of this event] was an unexpected response of the aircraft automation to pilot input into FMC. Obviously, the crew must be responsive to quickly correct even unexpected aircraft deviations. I think the pilot flying was immediately responsive to this event, as I recall, correcting the deviation to the best of human capabilities.Obviously we all should have discussed submission of a safety report. If others submitted one they were smarter than me. I would never intentionally violate operating rules, and I take this very seriously. In the future I will recall this event and even if any doubt exists, submit a safety report.		I am submitting this report in response to an email I received yesterday from [the company] Flight Safety Advisor. The purpose of his email was to notify me of the FAA intent to file a pilot deviation against the crew of [our flight from almost a month ago]. The purpose of this report is to more fully explain a situation that occurred during operations in the arrival terminal area shortly before landing. As this event occurred almost one month ago, all details are to the best of my recollection. All operations until arrival were normal and accomplished as expected. When we were in the approach environment the aircraft was connected to the autopilot and following FMS navigation and vertical profile parameters (VNAV Selected). As I was monitoring the descent the aircraft began to make its turn over one of the inbound waypoints, it suddenly leveled its wings and began to turn in the wrong direction. I took immediate action by disconnecting the autopilot, extending full speed brakes and arresting the descent, which had dipped below 10,000 feet. The quick action caused my First Officer to remark, 'It's good that you caught it right away.' I continued the approach manually and landed without incident. ATC made no mention of a possible deviation. After shutdown checks were completed the entire crew participated in an extensive de-brief, discussing the flight anomaly that happened. This strange event was seen by all as highly unusual in the combined experience of all four crewmembers. Of course, we suspected an autopilot/FMS system failure and I squawked it for Maintenance to sort out. My logbook entry appeared as follows: DURING RNAV ARRIVAL AIRCRAFT WAS LATE IN TURNING OVER A PATICULAR WAYPOINT AND EXCEEDED 250 KNOTS BELOW 10,000 WITH VNAV ENGAGED.  I honestly don't recall the precise numbers to the knot and foot, but I think we momentarily exceeded 250 knots below 10,000 feet due to the systems failure. To support this [assertion] I would like to direct your attention to the maintenance logbook entry in response to mine [which includes the statement] 'BOEING IS AWARE OF PROBLEM PER TECH TIP XX-XXXX. ...INTERMITTENT FAULT OK TO CONTINUE... Of particular note in [the maintenance] response is the entry that reads: 'BOEING IS AWARE OF PROBLEM PER TECH TIP...  [which referenced the following:] 'Uncommanded Turn in LNAV Due to Premature Sequencing of TO Waypoint Originated: 18-Sep-2010.' Because this article is labeled BOEING PROPRIETARY, CONFIDENTIAL, AND/OR TRADE SECRET I will not reproduce it here. Suffice it to say this document, which has been in the system for some time, essentially details what occurred on our flight. In this case, the real event was the [anomalous event specified] in my logbook entry to describe an aircraft system anomaly wherein the automation did not function as expected. The intent of the language used describing the malfunction was to use terms I believed to be well understood by mechanics that are familiar with the flight profile of the B-777. I chose those terms merely to show the aircraft behaved unusually with respect to known parameters in a clear and concise way to help direct them to the most likely source(s) of the problem.Well, in reference to B-777 automation, apparently Boeing has an ongoing program (Reference Tech Ref ATA:22-10) to address uncommanded turns while LNAV is in use. However, with regard to logbook entries, flight crews may need to be cautioned about accurately detailing the actual flight performance of their aircraft if in so doing they find themselves subject to an investigation for disclosing what is believed to be essential information needed to accurately describe aircraft system anomalies that deserve attention. It would be counterproductive to all flight safety initiatives to foster an environment where the flight crew is reticent to accurately document problems with the aircraft. An unintended consequence may be the truncating of certain data that could be useful towards the overall maintenance/safety effort.		Three weeks after the 'event' the FAA sought retribution from a B-777 flight crew for exceeding 250K below 10,000 on arrival at their destination.  The source of their information was a routine review of the AML in which the flight crew had written up anomalous behavior of the autoflight system while operating with the autopilot engaged in LNAV and VNAV modes.  The anomalous behavior described consisted of turning the wrong way at a waypoint and exceeding 250 knots below 10,000 feet.  Both anomalous actions were immediately resolved by the crew and, again, written up in the AML.

The FMC doesn't load all the altitudes for you so you have to manually put them in and that little bit of extra time was just enough to make us late descending.				The time required for the B737-700 flight crew to program an ATC assigned approach/runway change prevented them from initiating a descent required by their RNAV STAR assignment.

Takeoff was normal with normal indications.  We weighed 170,000 LBS and had almost full tanks of gas with a full load of passengers heading to ZZZ1.  Shortly after takeoff the Captain asked if I smelled anything.  I replied, 'Yes.'  It was not the normal galley/food smell, high heat smell or electrical burning smell, but more of a burning oil smell.  I associated it with the possible factories that we fly over in the ZZZ area.  The Captain called the flight attendants to see if they smelled it and they also smelled it in the back of the cabin.  Once the Captain heard this, he said that we were going to return to ZZZ.  I put my mask on and established communication (comm) and the Captain did as well.  ATC asked if we were declaring an emergency and the Captain responded, 'Yes.'  The Captain ran the checklist and I put the autopilot on and began the decent back to ZZZ for a landing on XXL.  We were only about 20 miles from the airport when we began the return.  My thought process was to get the aircraft on the ground as soon as possible and the Captain seemed to be the same. He ran as quickly as possible through the Smoke/Odor/Fumes Checklist while I set up for a 40-Flap max brakes, overweight landing.  We came back together on Final and ran through the Approach/Descent, Approach Checklist and set up to land.  After landing we called the flight attendants to see if they saw or smelled any more odors.  They did not and we proceeded to the gate.  Maintenance met us at the gate and said that they had borescoped the engine the night prior.  They said that nine out of ten times that is the cause of the smell.	Reporter stated he only smelled an odor, did not see any smoke; same for the flight attendants in the forward and aft cabin. He was not familiar with the engine borescope procedures that Maintenance performed other than Maintenance opened the borescope plugs and inspected the CFM-56 Engine.	Shortly after takeoff, I noticed a smell of electrical smoke in the cockpit.  As we climbed through 3,000, I felt the Circuit Breaker (CB) panels for heat.  I then called the flight attendants (F/A) to ask if they were using the ovens.  They replied, 'No.'  They also smelled smoke in both forward and aft sections of cabin.  First Officer (F/O) and I had a short discussion on what could be the cause. I chose to declare an emergency, and return to ZZZ, as I could not readily locate the source of the smoke. ATC cleared us to level off at 10,000. I instructed the F/O to continue flying.  He called for the Smoke Checklist. We were given vectors to ZZZ; I was also trying to communicate with the F/As about returning to ZZZ. I told them 5 minutes, but I did not tell them about the possibility that we may need to evacuate the airplane after landing. I had trouble locating the correct checklist the Pilot Flying called for. I was looking in wrong sections.  Pilot Flying donned mask. I had trouble communicating with him. I donned my mask and goggles about a minute or two after he did; we established communications. I found the Checklist, and ran it through the first two pages.  I stopped there to make sure we were ready for landing as we were now on final for XXL.  Approach Descent, Approach and Landing Checklist accomplished. Flap 40, Auto Brake max landing, approximately 170,000 lbs. F/O made a smooth touch down. We exited at Taxiway Mike.  The smell had dissipated significantly by then; I elected not to evacuate and taxied to [the gate].  Pilot Flying made some ATC calls and adjusted altitude selector as I was busy with other tasks.  F/O handled the workload I gave him with ease. Crew Coordination. Checklist confusion.		A Captain and First Officer report about a burning oil smell in the flight deck and cabin of a NexGen B737 aircraft shortly after takeoff. An emergency was declared and an air turnback accomplished. Maintenance noted that a Borescope Inspection had been accomplished on the CFM-56 engines the night before.

I was the Pilot Monitoring. We were climbing through FL180 on a Standard Instrument Departure. With full climb power on the engines, we heard a loud bang accompanied by vibration and a yaw to the left. The EGT was flashing red and indicated approximately 998 degrees. The Captain announced, 'Left engine failure,' and retarded the throttle to idle, disconnected the autopilot, and leveled the aircraft. We both assessed the engine instruments, determined it was a normal engine failure, declared an emergency, and requested an immediate return to ZZZ for landing. We proceeded with the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist in the QRH as we started a slow turn and descent back to ZZZ. We assessed the engine and determined a restart was possible. We ran the In-flight Engine Start Checklist but could not get the N2 to rise above 25%. We then aborted the in-flight restart and proceeded with the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist. We were cleared the ILS XXL at ZZZ and flew the 15 flap approach and landing to an uneventful full stop landing. With no smoke, fire, or braking issues we taxied to Gate XX, shut down the aircraft, and deplaned the passengers.  Periodically throughout the descent to landing, we communicated with the flight attendants and passengers to anticipate an uneventful landing. We also informed ATC of our souls on board and fuel remaining when questioned about this. We told them to inform crash, fire, and rescue personnel which engine had failed and that a normal landing and rollout was anticipated.		We departed ZZZ on the Departure. While climbing through 18,000 feet, there was a loud bang from the left engine area. The left engine N1 and N2 were rolling back, and the EGT was flashing RED and indicated approximately 998 degrees. I turned off the autopilot, reduced the left engine thrust lever, leveled the aircraft, and corrected the yaw. I announced a left engine failure and the First Officer pulled out the QRH. We assessed the engine and ran the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist. I told Center we had lost an engine, and declared an emergency and we needed to return to ZZZ. Center gave us a turn back to ZZZ and a lower altitude. The First Officer ran the checklist and, due to the parameters, we attempted an engine restart. The N2 never exceeded 25% so we aborted the restart. We notified the flight attendants and passengers of the problem and prepared for a one engine landing visual approach to XXL with an ILS backup. The First Officer computed the numbers for a Flaps 15, one engine landing, under max landing weight. We had an uneventful landing and rollout. The fire trucks reported no smoke or fire observed so we taxied single engine to Gate XX and shut down the aircraft. Contract Maintenance confirmed N2 section failure from initial inspection.		Air carrier departure described an engine failure during the climb to flight levels and the actions taken by the crew and ATC during the return to the departure airport.

Contract Maintenance came and we did an engine run on number two engine. No problems noted. Near cruise level off, I opened the fuel crossfeed valve and turned on the left center tank fuel pump as we had 500 LBS fuel in the center tank. The left center tank fuel low pressure light stayed illuminated. I turned off the left center fuel boost pump and turned on the right center tank boost pump. The right center tank fuel low pressure light stayed illuminated. I stopped trying to burn the fuel in the center tank. A few minutes later, the Fuel Imbalance warning illuminated. The right tank was 1,000 LBS low. I had not closed the fuel crossfeed valve. I left the crossfeed valve open and turned off the right main tank fuel pumps. I watched the fuel quantity gauges to verify that the imbalance was being corrected. After a few minutes, there was no difference in the left quantity and the right quantity was continuing to decrease. I alerted the First Officer to the problem and explained what had transpired. We reviewed the Fuel Imbalance QRH Checklist. As a precaution, we also reviewed the Engine Fuel Leak Checklist, which did not seem to apply. We were not using fuel at an excessive rate. We were not able to crossfeed and the imbalance was increasing. We contacted Dispatch and explained the problem. It was a mutual agreement to divert. We declared an emergency and landed without incident. Subsequent testing by Maintenance resulted in no discrepancies with the airplane. Try to ignore distractions during fuel operations.		During the preflight inspection, I noticed fluid I believed to be oil pooled under the #2 engine. The Captain contacted Maintenance Control and had Contract Maintenance come out to the aircraft. The Mechanic stated it was hydraulic fluid, dripping at a slow rate, and directed an engine run to check for leaks. After the engine run, he said there were no more drips. We departed about 20 minutes late, but expected an ontime arrival due to lack of deice and no departure delays. A while after reaching cruise altitude, the Captain noticed a fuel imbalance in excess of 1,000 LBS, with the #2 Engine being lower. He proceeded to crossfeed to rebalance the fuel, but after several minutes, the fuel imbalance continued to grow to approximately 1,400 LBS. I did see the #1 main pumps both on and both #2 main pumps off. The crossfeed was open. I cannot say with certainty the CROSSFEED light was on dim, but it was not bright. During this time, the quantity of fuel in the #1 tank did not decrease. The Captain then turned the crossfeed off. We were in the process of accomplishing the Fuel Imbalance Checklist. Given an unknown fuel issue and unable to control the balance, we elected to divert. The Captain coordinated with Dispatch while I declared an emergency with Center and got vectors. I initiated a descent and, as a precaution only, reviewed the Engine Fuel Leak Checklist. We did not accomplish it. Coordination for support was accomplished and after landing the rescue response found no indications of a leak. We taxied to the gate.		B737-700 flight crew experiences a fuel imbalance after attempting to use 500 LBS remaining in the center tank and forgetting to turn the crossfeed off when no fuel can be used. When the imbalance is noted the fuel pumps for the low wing are turned off but the imbalance appears to grow worse. The flight diverts to a suitable airport but Maintenance can find no discrepancy.

We discovered the crossfeed valve Circuit Breaker (C/B) was popped and we were unable to verify its position. We ran the Crossfeed Selector Inoperative Checklist and had our Lead Flight Attendant visually check to ensure no fuel spray from the right side of aircraft. With no fuel leak indicated on Totalizers or visual, we chose to continue to our destination. But the imbalance was increasing, what seemed rapidly, with now 1,000 LBS difference between Engine One and Two.  We elected to divert to ZZZ2 as the imbalance increased. Although we did not suspect a fuel leak at this time, as we configured for landing, a deadheading Flight Attendant sitting near the overwing, reported to the Lead Flight Attendant that she thought she saw some misty spray when the flaps were lowered. As a precaution, we declared an emergency so Rescue could ensure there was not an associated leak. Rescue reported no leak and we continued to the gate. Maximum imbalance was 1,300 LBS. Contract Maintenance fixed all issues and released the aircraft.	Reporter stated he believes Contract Maintenance had replaced the fuel crossfeed valve to correct the problem.			During cruise, a B737-700 flight crew notices a fuel imbalance with #2 Engine fuel tank 700 LBS lighter.

Lost approximately 24 systems associated with AC Bus 1. First Officer took over controls as pilot flying maintained stable flight as we lost both autopilots and autothrust. I carried out our Non-Normal Procedures as per Flight Operations Manual, A320 Pilot Hand Book, and QRH, conducting ECAM actions. ECAM actions guided us to a point where we were to reset Number 1 Generator to restore AC BUS 1; 'one attempt only, if no reset then select GEN 1 off'; which was the case. After completing ECAM, and ECAM follow-up in QRH, it was apparent that we were not going to restore AC BUS 1.After reviewing the failures which included Thrust Reverser 1, Spoiler 3, and Brake System 1 associated with loss of Blue Electric Pump and Blue Hydraulic System, I decided that as a precaution we should not attempt a landing but should, instead, divert to an airport with a longer runway. I contacted Dispatch and he agreed that we divert to a nearby airport as it was closer to our 'Present Position', which we had been considering. We then advised ATC that we were diverting due to aircraft systems lost to an electrical failure that could affect our required landing distance and I wanted a longer runway than at [the nearest airport]. I then advised the flight attendants of the situation and, as we had lost the cabin PA function from the flight deck, asked them to inform the passengers. We were given expeditious handling by ATC and I decided it unnecessary to declare an emergency as we had full control of the airplane and all crucial systems were operating normally except the automation. The left Thrust Reverser was inoperative, but had the right; spoiler three was inoperative as well but we had considered these failures when we selected our diversion airport and runway. Weather in the area was clear VMC. Upon contacting Approach I decided it would be prudent to have the fire trucks called out. The Controller said that we would have to 'declare an emergency' to have the crash trucks out. After a few seconds of contemplation on my part the Controller said 'we declared an emergency for you' and they deployed the fire trucks along our landing runway. I did not at any time declare an emergency. The only event that frustrated our course of action was the loss of communications with operations due to loss of ACARS. I could have gone over to commercially provided radio but decided I needed to get back with the First Officer who was flying the airplane manually and handing ATC communications. I wanted evaluate our fuel situation and make the decision to start heading to a suitable diversion airport. I decided that letting ATC know our intentions, would get back to Operations and we could deal with our primary duty of getting the airplane to a safe landing. In range of our diversion station I called operations and informed them of our ETA.The landing was uneventful. Maintenance met the aircraft at the gate.				An A320 flight crew enroute suffered the loss of AC BUS 1 and elected to divert to an airport with longer runways due to the resulting partial loss of spoilers and reverse thrust. ATC declared an emergency for them when they requested CFR as a precaution.

The Controller on the second Approach Control frequency gave us an intercept heading of 290 degrees to intercept the final approach course. Approximately one minute later the Controller's instructions were to turn to 250 degrees to re-intercept the final approach course. The pilot not flying informed the Controller that our 290 degree intercept heading looked good for [Runway] 27L. The Controller then stated that our assigned runway is 28C and we needed to turn to 250 degrees and then said 'I am not sure what runway I assigned you'. On our new heading of 250 degrees we intercepted the Runway 28C approach course approximately 25 NM out but were now only 3 NM from the proceeding aircraft. We then experienced a wake turbulence event which required the autopilot to be disconnected and power to be added. The pilot not flying informed the Controller that we were too close to the preceding aircraft and that we were slowing to 190 KTS. After this event the remainder of the approach and landing were uneventful.		I notified ATC of the wake turbulence encounter and that we were slowing to 190 KTS. The response back was, 'it was a 737-900 and it was the same type airplane and it should not be a problem.'  Well it was a problem and I had not yet been cleared for a visual approach yet and separation was the Controller's responsibility.  We slowed and the rest of the approach was uneventful.		A B737-800 encountered the wake vortices of a B737-900 on approach into ORD.

We accomplished all Before Start, Push, Taxi, and Takeoff checklists normally. As we retracted the gear after takeoff we experienced what felt like a large bird smashing into the left side of the nose, one loud bang. All engine instruments where normal and we continued climbing. A few moments later, around 7,000 MSL, there were three or more loud bangs accompanied with a slight yaw. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and immediately applied the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall Immediate Action items.All engine indications normal. We kept the engine running and leveled off at 10,000. I reported our issue to Departure and requested vectors to the ILS Runway 35L. We had just briefed and shot that ILS on our inbound flight. The flight attendants were very concerned about the banging noise and knew something was not normal. They had rung the flight deck and after I had communicated with Departure I answered their call. I informed them the right engine wasn't performing normally and we were going to return to [our departure airport] and make a normal landing. 'All is good and I'm about to make a PA.' I briefed the passengers and advised we would make a normal landing and I would speak to them again when we arrived at the gate. I also made a quick call to airport Operations and informed them we were returning, so they could start the process of getting us a gate and contacting Dispatch. The First Officer was doing a very nice job flying the aircraft and after we looked at the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall Checklist in the QRH we decided to leave the engine running and run the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist just in case we had to shut down the engine. At some point we received an Off Scheduled Descent master caution and I ran that checklist as well. The controllers initiated an emergency for us and started vectoring us for an ILS 35R. I entered that approach into the CDU and briefed it. The weather was 300 overcast, visibility one mile in fog. After running the landing data, all the appropriate checklists and briefing the approach, I took over the Pilot Flying duties, shot the ILS 35R, made a normal landing, and taxied to the gate.On a return to the departing airport an Off Schedule Descent light is expected. More information in the QRH would be helpful to ensure the landing pressurization is correct. Our original destination altitude was 750 FT (MSL) and we landed back at our departure airport which is several thousand feet higher. When all the checklists were run and the approach briefed, the aircraft was still pressurizing to 750 FT. We selected manual opening the out flow valve after discovering this problem while taxiing in.		Concern is that myself and 'C' flight attendant were told directly, 'Probably should not be telling you this, but this aircraft had been in maintenance last 2 days and was pulled out of service for exactly same emergency situation that we just had and had to divert and return to gate. Fuel leak in engine housing causing visible flames from passengers in cabin and extreme turbulence from engine stopping/restarting/back-firing.'Would like to know who serviced this aircraft? What was found? Was it even fixed? Definitely feel test flight should have been done before sending pax and crew out on first flight after this happened		A B737-700 crew experienced compressor stalls on climbout and return to the departure airport. The aircraft had been signed off as airworthy after a previous flight had experienced compressor stalls.

I immediately knew that we could not land at [the destination airport] in this configuration. The First Officer leveled the airplane at 2,000 and I told the Tower that we had a flight control malfunction, would continue straight out, level at 2,000 FT, and get back with them shortly. I directed the First Officer to fly and communicate with ATC while I accomplished the QRH procedure. We determined a diversion to a nearby airport to take advantage of the longer runway was the safest course of action, so we declared an emergency. I entered a diversion report in ACARS, communicated with the flight attendants and then told the passengers what was going on. When we raised the landing gear, however, the landing gear warning horn sounded continuously at cruise power, so we elected to fly gear down. We landed smoothly and normally some 15 minutes later. Blocked in with just 4,200 LBS of fuel on board, so time was of the essence on this divert. The First Officer did a great job flying the airplane and handling ATC while I was working the QRH. ATC handled us very well, were patient and understanding when we were busy accomplishing tasks and didn't load us up with too many questions or unnecessary vectors. I could suggest that the QRH procedure for Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry be tidied up just a little bit in the decision about using Vref 15 or Vref ICE on step 3. I believe I inadvertently used Vref ICE when it wasn't necessary. It also should include a note to leave the flaps in the final setting after landing, instead of selecting flaps up. This might aid Maintenance in working the problem. I had decided to do this anyway, and the AMT [Aircraft Maintenance Technician] was thankful for that. Due to the facts that it was day six in a row for me (28 hours flying plus 4 hours deadheading), and day five for the First Officer, and due to the rush of excitement in the divert, we both declined to fly another airplane to [the original destination] and ended the trip [at the diversion airport].				A B737-800 flight crew inbound to a short runway suffered asymmetrical trailing edge flap extension at less than landing flap settings.  They elected to divert to a major nearby airport with longer runways.

We started into the QRH and got a bleed trip on the Number 1 Engine. The aircraft began to depressurize at a rate of about 1,000 to 2,000 FPM. We donned our masks and established crew communication. This was very loud and was a very challenging aspect of the situation. I asked ATC for a lower altitude due to a pressurization problem and declared an emergency. We started a rapid descent and the Cabin Altitude Warning horn sounded shortly thereafter. We talked to approximately four different controllers and had several different altitude clearances while trying to work the problem. By about 25,000 FT, the trip reset was successful and we regained pressurization, but we discussed it and opted to continue our descent to 10,000 FT in case the problem came back. I notified Dispatch and the Captain made a PA advising the passengers of the issue. We told the flight attendants what was going on and they helped to clarify to the passengers the issue because the PA that the Captain gave was apparently difficult for them to hear because he had his oxygen mask on. The masks in the cabin did not drop because the cabin altitude never got above approximately 10,500 FT. By the time we worked through the checklists and finished the descent we were about 80 miles or so from destination and we decided to continue there after checking the weather and landed uneventfully. The QRH was a bit tough to get through having the Bleed Trip Off, Cabin Altitude Warning, and Emergency Descent to get through, especially with the breathing noise over the speakers and headset, ATC communication, flight attendants calling, etc., and I can't stress enough how fast the time went by. We were already low by the time we got to the bottom part of the Emergency Descent Checklist to the part where it addresses the 'in case of a dual bleed trip' area. This should possibly be moved to the top of that checklist because of the different procedure and 290 KT speed reference in it. We both felt that we took safe and conservative actions for the safety of our passengers and crew.				B737-700 Captain experiences a dual bleed trip as thrust is reduced to begin descent from FL410. Oxygen masks are doned and QRH procedures are complied with. The bleed trip is reset passing FL250 and the passenger oxygen masks do not drop. Flight continues to destination at 10,000 FT.

As Pilot Monitoring, I could see a glow from the ALS but I don't know what the Pilot Flying saw; he did not verbalize his intention to start manual control of the aircraft. My first indication was the flight director (FD) bars commanding a climb and a 30 knot increase in target airspeed. Looking lower over the nose, I could see the ALS and TDZ. With the FD providing GA guidance, the Pilot Flying had difficulty flying raw ILS data and transitioning to visual flight reference with the PAPI. With a wind shift from left quartering tailwind to right crosswind, the Pilot Flying executed some track and glideslope oscillations and we got a SINK RATE warning from the GPWS below 100 feet RA. I called for nose up and power while backing up the Pilot Flying on the controls. A nominal touchdown and roll out was made. In the short time frame of the event from FD mode change, through what is our status (VMC), to departure from glideslope, I considered trying to re-establish proper FD ILS guidance, but thought outside visual reference and less heads down FMS management would be better. Short answer, better training. On a subsequent CAVU night, cleared for the visual approach, cleared for landing using ILS guidance, I selected TOGA at 400 feet AGL to see if FD ILS guidance could be re-established quickly. With the Pilot Flying going high on the glideslope in short order, LOC but not glideslope guidance was reacquired. From this limited analysis, it appears a quick de-selection of the FD's per FOM would have been our best course to eliminate confusing guidance. For decades, standard simulator training has entailed very predictable transitions from IMC to VMC landing, or no landing environment sighted/fouled runway GA's and missed approaches all at the charted approach minimums. With landing visibility, maintaining the aircraft's current glidepath and course with minimal adjustment gives a high successful landing rate, there's not much time for the pilot to deviate. Perhaps adding a variable approach scenario with higher ceiling and visibility (the more common real world situation) to practice the IMC to VMC transition with erroneous FD guidance added to improve pilots' competence and response to an abnormal. Globally, the requirements to use the highest levels of automation and maintain electronic glideslope when available has degraded large airline commercial pilots' basic airmanship abilities from VFR maneuvering to raw data instrument navigation. An old rule of thumb was Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. To that I would put communicate as the fourth priority. On the line, I see making inputs to the FMC as the highest priority in 99% of the first officers. Prime example:  new ATC clearance, 'ABC turn right heading 330, direct XYZ when able.' With the aircraft in Heading Select, autopilot engaged, instead of quickly complying with ATC instructions with a one-step twist of the Heading Select knob on the MCP, the First Officer goes heads down to the CDU and executes six to seven keystrokes, verify with Pilot Monitoring, execute, and select LNAV while the aircraft has traveled four to six miles straight ahead, not turning as cleared by ATC. I just think it is very indicative of an over reliance on automation and a deterioration of thinking and flying ability.				B737-800 Captain reports an inadvertent TOGA selection by the flying First Officer, approaching minimums, followed quickly by deselecting autopilot and autothrust. The approach is continued to landing in marginal VMC with some glideslope excursions and the flight director indicating go-around.

The preflight, taxi out, and takeoff were uneventful. I went on first break. About 20 minutes into my break, I was woken up by the galley Flight Attendant, and was told I was needed in the cockpit, and we were returning to [departure airport.] I returned to the cockpit with the Purser, who wanted to be briefed by the Captain on what to expect. On returning to the cockpit, I found the aircraft at FL350. The First Officer was starting to run the Low Oil Pressure Checklist on the Left engine. He ran that checklist, [and] then I helped him with the Drift Down checklist. During that time, I noted the Left engine had zero oil quantity, and wind milling oil pressure of about 7 psi. The Captain obtained clearance to descend and return direct [departure airport.] I briefed the Purser initially, as the Captain was still busy, [and] then he finished filling her in on our situation. We started dumping fuel per that checklist. The Captain asked me to check the diversion guide in the FOM for anything we may have missed. We all discussed the approach and landing, and cleared up a few minor confusions about the checklist. The Captain made the initial PA to the cabin, and I followed that up with a few more, as the situation warranted. We finished dumping fuel, and started the Fuel Imbalance checklist. Set up for the Visual Approach. All the normal and irregular checklists and procedures were finished (except for the fuel crossfeed, which the Captain elected to continue to landing). We made a normal single engine landing, and taxied clear of the runway, and stopped crossfeeding. After the crash trucks checked the aircraft, we taxied to gate.				A B777 left engine LOW OIL PRESS alerted at cruise shortly after takeoff, so an emergency was declared, fuel dump begun, the QRH completed and the flight returned to the departure airport.

The STAR that was filed has published altitudes much lower than what was flight planned by Dispatch greatly increasing our fuel burns. Our new fuel policy already puts us into a tight spot with regard to arrival fuel, but an inaccurate flight plan with expected altitudes puts even greater pressure on our arrival fuel.The new fuel policy needs to have a larger window for error so that we aren't put into a critical fuel situation with any abnormal issues.  Our flight plans should also have more accurate altitudes so that they can be trusted more for the information they are providing.				B737 First Officer laments his company's new fuel policy that is exacerbated by flight plans with unrealistic altitude assumptions, resulting in low arrival fuel.

I initiated a SATCOM call with Maintenance and asked that Dispatch be brought into the call. While talking with the engine expert the oil quantity decreased to zero and the oil pressure dropped extremely low. We jointly decided that an engine shutdown and return to [departure airport] was the best course of action. I called the cabin at door 1L, gave them a brief explanation and asked that the relief pilot and Lead Flight Attendant come to the cockpit. We obtained a clearance to FL220 [and direct to departure airport]. While turning we shut down the L engine per the Eng Oil Press L Checklist, established drift down to FL220 and briefed the Lead Flight Attendant (no evacuation prep required). We then coordinated fuel dumping with ATC and dumped fuel to our max landing weight. I made an announcement to the passengers explaining the situation, telling them that they should expect a normal landing because 'this is what we train for'. We then had to complete the Fuel Imbalance checklist (which is absurdly long and wordy). On initial contact with Center we declared an emergency with Approach Control [and] we confirmed emergency equipment standing by. I flew a Visual/ILS for a 20 flap landing. Normal landing and rollout. After clearing the [runway] the Fire Department looked over the aircraft and cleared us to continue taxi.		[Narrative 2 contains no additional information]		B777 flight crew reported loss of oil quantity and pressure in left engine. After consulting with Maintenance and Dispatch the engine was shut down, and emergency declared, and the flight returned to departure airport.

They deferred Brake System 1 and we blocked out 4 minutes late after having to wait for the maintenance release. After start and before taxi we got N/W STRG Fault ECAM and I contacted Maintenance Control. He had me cycle the A/Skid and N/W STRG switch which cleared the ECAM. During the short taxi to the runway, I had to hold full left rudder or about 10 degrees left with the tiller to track the taxiway centerline. The First Officer and I both agreed that this was not acceptable and we returned to the gate. Maintenance replaced the BSCU black box which cleared the Brake System 1 deferred item and completed the autoland test to return the aircraft to CIII status. Maintenance finished the repairs and after a discussion with Dispatch about fuel for the flight we were OK with the same planned fuel and called for the fuel truck while they boarded the flight. After about 40 minutes and six calls to Operations and no fueler, but were told each time that the fueler was on the way, I called Dispatch again and raised the fuel 700 LBS to generate a new fuel request and advised him of our problems getting fuel. He said that he would advise Load Planning as they had a direct line to the fuelers. After a two hour maintenance delay this additional delay was NOT acceptable. The taxi and takeoff were normal. After landing we got Brake System 1 Fault and Steering ECAMS with some erroneous steering inputs that I corrected with differential braking and we exited the runway onto taxiway. During the rollout the Tower cleared us to cross the parallel runway but without steering I stopped short of the runway and we advised Tower of our mechanical problem and would need a tug to be towed to the gate. The First Officer contacted Maintenance and they wanted us to reset several circuit breakers which I declined after having just experienced the steering failure. I did not want to risk blocking the runway as just past the hold short line is a sharp turn that I did not want to attempt with differential braking between landing aircraft if we had another failure.				A320 Captain experiences brake and steering faults prior to departure and Maintenance replaces the BSCU. After landing at destnation the same faults return and the aircraft is towed to the gate.

The glideslope indicator was passing through centered to the below glideslope indication, so the aircraft began a strong climb to 'catch' the glideslope. I disengaged the autopilot and began a smooth pushover. I topped out at 3,300 before correcting back to 3,000 prior to PAYMI.Do not engage approach mode prior to localizer capture. Be more situationally aware of where the glideslope is and where capture should occur.		Fast fingered Captain should wait until we are established on the LOC course inbound and at PAYMI before engaging APP mode for ILS.		Prior to intercepting the LGA Runway 13 ILS localizer, a B737-800 Captain selected the APP mode and as the glideslope indicatored passed through centered climbing, the aircraft unexpectely pitched.

We reported the Potomac River in sight when asked by ATC. I was Pilot Flying and had acquired a visual on the Potomac so that we could fly the ground track to the airport. I continued to gradually descend in vertical speed mode while configuring the aircraft and precisely flying the river, being careful not to overfly the prohibited areas. I leveled off at approximately 550 feet AGL while, visually, [we appeared to be] three to four NM from the airport. FOQA reported that we were five to six NM from airport [where] the RIVER VISUAL procedure recommends 1,800 feet. I easily had visual contact with all the structures on the banks of the river. GPWS alerted us with one 'too low, terrain' advisory. I initiated a gentle climb back up to 8 or 900 feet AGL and started to acquire the VASIs at the runway and completed an uneventful landing. Additionally, on the descent below 10,000 feet, the airspeed did not decelerate below 250 until we were approximately 8,500 feet. More attention to altitude on the visual approach and airspeed on the descent is required on my part in the future. A combination of factors played a part in this event, fatigue being one of them. We started late and ended late; flying two long legs, [the first requiring] passage through Immigration and Customs, changing planes and flying into a challenging domestic airport (DCA) late at night. I had not flown into DCA in years. My First Officer was a recently recalled from furlough pilot with limited experience on the plane. I, personally, have only three months experience on the plane as well. The combined lack of experience on the plane and the challenging arrival airport, compounded with fatigue makes a fertile ground for errors. I will prepare even more so the next time these circumstances present themselves.	The reporter advised the RIVER VISUAL approach is not a line selectable procedure.  As a back-up he had line selected the RNAV (RNP) Rwy 19 approach for situational awareness.  Doing so provided computed vertical glide path guidance via the VPI (Vertical Path Indicator), but he forthrightly declared that he had failed to monitor the display as he concentrated on maintaining the lateral track over the river, conscientiously avoiding the two prominent prohibited areas.  At the time he believed he had good visual awareness of the descent relative to the airport, an awareness he now declared was obviously inaccurate.He advised neither pilot was sufficiently experienced with the approach to be able to recognize or relate to the multiple bridges along the Potomac as visual indicators of appropriate altitudes as they were passed.He stated that, in the future, his preferred technique would be to utilize the RNAV procedure for lateral awareness and hard tune the DCA VOR as a reference for the recommended altitudes at given DMEs as depicted on the RIVER VISUAL.	Was just alerted to the fact that we got REALLY low on the River Vis 19 at DCA. It was VFR conditions, midnight with an overcast layer and it was really dark. As the Pilot Not Flying, I lost SA! I thought we were further [down] the river than we were.  When we received a Terrain Alert I thought were at the George Mason Bridge and received the alert because we were LATERALLY to close to it (to the right, inside of the turn). When in actuality (as I learned today) [we were] at the 3 DME turn at the Key bridge. Because I thought we were turning final. I flipped up the cover and turned the Terrain warning off and announced it to the Captain. Looking back, I'm not convinced he heard me. Also, I just remembered, I had the wrong crew show time for the departure in CUN, so I showed up in the lobby two hours early. Tried to go back to my room, but they were already cleaning it, so I sat and read in the lobby until the rest of the crew showed up. Completely my fault! BACK UP THE DME OFF THE VOR. Go old school and be safe. Really think something was not set up correctly with the VNAV.		A B737NG flight crew descended to 550 feet AGL six miles from the airport, versus recommended 1,800 feet MSL, while conducting a RIVER VISUAL approach to Runway 19 at DCA.  Following receipt of an EGPWS Terrain warning they climbed and re-established the profile to a safe landing.

PM in left seat questioned IAS and relayed that he was seeing IAS rollback, altitude fluctuate on PFD display and matched in HUD. PF had associated IAS and ALT disagree annunciations matched on bottom of PFD. Both FMC/CDU screens became degraded. Flight Director and map displays were normal. Ex: winds aloft data both on IRS and on FMC were not accurate with report info from PIREPS as relayed by ATC. No Master Caution illuminated. No CBs popped. PM discovered EEC [in] alt mode on overhead, depressed recall then engine light noted. PF sought VMC conditions with ATC and maintained aircraft control and ATC comms. PM performed QRH checklist, comms with Dispatch and Maintenance via phone patch as VHF comm frequencies on release weren't satisfactory. Dispatch recommended ZZZ (close by) and later [continue to destination]. Crew chose to maintain VMC above undercast with good ambient lighting all the way to destination reported with straight-in long runway and VMC conditions. Fuel log with Dispatch, IAS and ALT cross checks with ATC were performed while troubleshooting malfunctioning systems. Landed uneventfully at destination, maintained VMC entire portion of leg. System operated normally on descent after Descent Checklist completion. Air data computer failure of this nature not common. Never experienced kind of indications without associated Master Caution prior to this event. Felt risk of descending into IMC conditions or congested airport environment with degraded flight instruments could have become compounded further with any more malfunctions of PFD instruments PF was monitoring. Both PF and PM had never been exposed to a similar malfunction in training. Exposing this scenario would be valuable. We discussed [previous] pitot static aircraft problems where PF used HUD as only info available to maintain aircraft control and situational awareness. PM PFD erroneous indications matched in HUD and EEC soft alt mode switchover.		At approximately 15,000 feet in IMC, icing conditions, all probe heat and engine anti ice on; PM (me) noticed a/s alt roll back. Queried PF--he had more reliable data, and maintained a/c control. I believe I heard a lone callout of 'airspeed' from the GPWS. I thought; why aren't we getting the stall warning? Tried to analyze all seemingly unrelated malfunctions: Bad data in HUD (269 knot tailwind) and CDU's, checked circuit breakers (all in). No master caution light or display source light illuminated. Noticed EEC's in soft alt, hit Master Caution and ENG remained illuminated. Pilots conferred and agreed that returning not as desirable as seeking VMC conditions to get out of a possible cause (icing conditions). Wanted VMC to analyze the situation, in case it worsened and the only way was to climb. Climbing to better fuel economy altitudes would also buy us more time, and provide more options if we had to divert, once we knew what was wrong. Verified our altitude and airspeed with ATC and requested block altitudes. After being stabilized, attempted contact with Dispatch/Maintenance. Could not raise on several frequencies, got phone patch. Was hoping for an easy fix from Maintenance. Phone patch became unreliable, made contact on VHF. PF continued to verify alt and a/s with each controller. PM made fuel checks with dispatch. At some point Dispatch offered ZZZ as a divert. We did not like this idea as we still did not fully know what was wrong, would have to go into IMC, and it was close so we would have been rushed. ZZZ1 was also not liked as an option for similar reasons and traffic. The previous leg we flew was from ZZZ2 so we knew the further east we went the more VMC we'd have. At one point Maintenance asks if we had a 'display source' light, we did not. When referencing the display source checklist, our problem and overall situational awareness became clearer: With the opposite autopilot on, a DEU failure will cause the erroneous readings (failures) to the other pilots displays. Also it says the EEC's will be in soft alt and to run the EEC failure checklist. We were unable to restore anything, but at least we had a pretty good idea of the nature of the problem. At this point, our original destination, long runways and VMC conditions, seemed like the best option and we were almost there, so we continued to original destination and considered preparations for a safe arrival. At 13,000 feet, for no apparent reason, all of our instrumentation returned.		B737-700 flight crew experiences airspeed and altitude anomalies on the Captain's displays during climb. Crew elects to maintain an intermediate altitude in VMC and continue to destination also VMC. During descent the Captain's instruments return to normal.

The First Officer confirmed the smell as well. I then transferred control of the airplane to the First Officer and contacted the flight attendants. They also confirmed the smell as well. We told them we would be retuning to departure airport and to prepare the cabin for landing. We then notified ATC that we would be returning. I contacted Maintenance and they notified Company that we would be returning. The smell started getting worse. Since we were above landing weight we completed the Overweight Landing Checklist. We landed and then returned to the gate a half hour after takeoff. All the crew was experiencing effects of chemical inhalation so we had paramedics come to the gate. Many passengers were also experiencing symptoms as well according to the flight attendants. A few of the passengers approached me and were very thankful we landed and confirmed that they were also worried about the 'smell' as it was very strong. The paramedics recommended that we (the crew) all be transported to the hospital for further treatment and observation.		Captain called Flight Attendant A, asked if we smelled anything, we did not. Asked Flight Attendant C to due a walk through cabin. I was C, so I did a walk through cabin. Asked B if he smelled anything, he did not. As I walking back up to my jumpseat and reached overwing, I did smell a bad snuffy odor. When I got to my jumpseat, I told Flight Attendant A I smelled the odor at overwing. She called Captain back, and apparently the odor was really bad in the flight deck, and the Captain then made an announcement, we were going to return to the gate, we were probably only 10-15 minutes out. Passengers all deplaned, [and] then all crew stayed in the jet bridge. Captain called paramedics and they met up us. Paramedics checked us all out upstairs, and took us all to the hospital were we all spent approximately 5 hours in ER.		An A320 developed a strong odor after takeoff, so the Captain asked the flight attendants to confirm cabin odor then returned immediately to the departure airport where paramedics suggested medical treatment for the crew.

We were able to send and receive ACARS messages with Dispatch and Maintenance. Per Maintenance, we attempted a reset of all three RMPs and were able to use VHF-3 for radio frequency changes and communication. We were able to continue and land at ZZZ1.	Reporter stated the reset procedure for the Radio Management Unit RMPs suggested by Maintenance was to cycle the 'On-Off' power switch and wait five seconds between position selection, before returning to the 'On' position.  Only # 3 RMP was functional for frequency and communications after that on the A320.  The 'on guard' reference was the phrase they use when they monitor 121.5 on Comm # 2 and not meant as a reference to the 'guarded' NAV selection on the RMPs.

Captain said to stay a dot high on glideslope (GS) to avoid wake. I, pilot flying, agreed. As we started intermediate descent from about 6,000 FT to 5,000 FT we encountered moderate turbulence with rolling tendencies. Without hesitation I disengaged autopilot (AP), as I correctly interpreted encountering the 747's wake. Told the Captain (pilot not flying) that I was going to hand fly. He said no problem. A final vector/heading we were told to intercept localizer for Runway 28L. I engaged the VOR/LOC to arm and capture localizer. After getting LOC CAP displayed on FMA and following FD commands we were then told cleared for ILS Approach. I then armed APCH to capture GS. Captain said, 'GS alive' followed by GS CAP. I followed FD commands with AP off, continuing to configure with gear and flaps, fully configured in the slot by 1,500 FT AFL. AT approximately 700 FT AFL on GS Captain said LOCS not armed and that I was in HDG SEL with a 3/4 - full scale deflection to the right, meaning I was left of course. I began to maneuver the aircraft back to the right to get back on the LOC immediately and at almost the same time we broke out of the clouds and I maneuvered the aircraft back onto the LOC for a safe and smooth landing. We do not know why the aircraft fell out of LOC CAP mode and defaulted to HDG SEL. We never lost GS CAP mode. I was fully configured and on speed with no excessive maneuvering. We talked about possible go around but broke out of the clouds almost immediately when all this took place. While a go around may have been the better option, I felt due to rising terrain to the left and right of the aircraft may have put us in an unsafe situation since we were off the LOC and we did break out by 500 FT AFL. We advised ATC after landing they said no one reported problems with localizer. We took same aircraft [out] and had no similar problems.				B737-800 First Officer reported losing LOC capture on approach to SFO for unknown reasons.

They were getting ready to perform a Ground Pressurization Test and asked us to remain at the top of the jet bridge while they performed their test. The test was due to a previous write-up for pressurization leak. Maintenance completed their test and signed-off the logbook along with our ETOPS sign-off. We then loaded the aircraft and proceeded on our leg from ZZZ to ZZZ1. On climb out above 17,000 FT we started to get a really loud air leak sound and could not determine where it was coming from, but it was very pronounced. We discussed the fact that this airplane had just had the pressurization check performed back on the ground in ZZZ to try to find the leak and the fact that the leak still existed even though all indications for cabin pressurization was normal. We also discussed whether it was prudent to continue the flight. Captain talked to the flight attendants in back [of cabin] multiple times to find out what 'they' were also hearing and feeling [and if] what sounded like a possible pressurization leak and also eventually a vibration coming from somewhere on the left side of the aircraft. After talking to Maintenance, Dispatch and the Flight Attendants in the back of the aircraft and based on the noise that we could hear and the vibration that we could feel, we agreed that the best course of action was to not continue this ETOPS flight and to return to ZZZ as soon as possible, therefore an emergency was declared and we came back to ZZZ and performed an uneventful overweight landing. After returning to ZZZ, we switched to a different aircraft, re-boarded and then departed to ZZZ1. Climb and cruise within first 30 minutes of flight. Use of Captain's emergency authority [and] priority handling from ATC.	Reporter stated they were flying a B737-800 ETOPS aircraft. The aircraft did maintain normal cabin pressurization up through 34,000 FT, but the loud air leak squeal and cabin vibration, especially on the left side of the aircraft, was not making the passengers happy or comfortable; so they returned to field. No abnormal engine vibration was noted. He does not have any current information as to what the corrective action might have been.	Before we accepted it, aircraft came in with maintenance write-up concerning a loud squeal coming from Door-1l while operating above FL300. ZZZ Maintenance advised that significant debris was found around door seal and was removed. Door seal was cleaned and aircraft pressurized to 1.5 PSI on ground, no squeal was heard and aircraft returned to service. Departed ZZZ, upon climbout passing FL180, loud squeal was heard coming from Door-1l. Cabin pressure was normal to FL340; squeal increased in volume and could be heard through cabin.[We] elected to return to ZZZ, initiated phone patch through ZZZ2 ARINC to Dispatch and Maintenance Control to advise/discuss intentions. Cleared to ZZZ arrival at 17,000 FT; squeal stopped descending through FL250. Advised ATC of need to hold and burn off fuel to preclude Overweight Landing. During hold, experienced very pronounced and unusual vibration coming from Door 1l (1-Left) vicinity for about 10 seconds duration. Flight attendants advised vibration was felt all the way to back of aircraft. Declared emergency, requested clearance to airport and performed overweight landing without incident. Weight and Balance. Air Return. Mechanical.		A Captain and First Officer report a very loud squeal sound and vibration could be heard and felt throughout the cabin as their B737-800 ETOPS aircraft climbed through 17,000 FT. Emergency declared and aircraft returned to departure airport. Cabin pressurization had remained normal.

We were on a straight in approach to Runway 35L in IFR conditions with reported heavy snow and parallel operations being conducted to Runway 35R. Approximately 23 miles from the field we were instructed to contact Tower. The Captain was flying the aircraft with both autopilots engaged for the briefed Cat III approach to autoland. At an approximate altitude of 10,000 MSL the TCAS gave a commanded descending RA because of an aircraft on approach to the parallel Runway 35R. All procedures and radio calls were made appropriately with the Captain disengaging the autopilot and immediately initiating a vertical descent while remaining on the lateral profile and I made a radio call to Tower of TCAS descent. While the Captain was primarily engaged with the maneuver I focused on the intruder position and mentioned he was to the right and below. We both agreed that a descent into the intruder did not make sense, but the TCAS command was followed as we do not know what the intruder is being commanded or if they were receiving any TCAS commands. I would approximate 10 seconds later the TCAS gave an abrupt reversal command for a maximum climb which the Captain immediately performed and I gave another call to Tower of a TCAS climb and told the Captain they were close to the right and 200 FT below.Shortly after initiating the TCAS climb the event was over. I asked the Captain if he would like to do a go-around which he instructed yes since we would not be able to get back on a stabilized vertical profile. We were instructed by Tower to maintain heading and climb to 10,000 FT and eventually we were switched over to Approach Control. At all times we remained on the proper lateral profile for the approach to Runway 35L. At no time did I hear any response from Tower to the two TCAS callouts made.Our TCAS was obviously operating in the TA/RA mode. Subsequent discussion with the Captain about the event was the Company FOM mentioning of an allowed procedure to switch the TCAS mode to TA only when intentionally operating in close environments to other aircraft to prevent RA's. In contrast to a PRM approach where there is a monitoring Controller, in this case we have two aircraft more than 20 miles from the airport on different Tower frequencies, on different approaches, to different runways, approximately 5,000 FT apart. While I understand the intention of the procedure of switching the TCAS mode to TA only and its benefits while in VFR conditions it should be noted this is not a required procedure and I personally do not agree with the procedure when in IFR conditions operating outside Tower's normal area of responsibility, not knowing who is responsible for monitoring the positions of close aircraft on non-PRM approaches, on different frequencies, coupled with the fact that this procedure will never prevent an overshoot or blunder into the path of an adjacent aircraft.Further discussions with the Captain was that I am sure even with parallel runways approximately 5,000 FT apart that Approach Control was attempting to stagger (offset) the aircraft to adjacent runways but for some reason it did not work out that way for our approach. Our second approach had the adjacent aircraft between 2-3 miles ahead of us on their profile and no TCAS events occurred. If possible I would like to receive notification of how close our two aircraft came to each other.		I was pilot flying on ILS 35L at DEN between CHOLA and CELBI descending between 10,000 FT and 9,000 FT on glideslope when we got a 'traffic, traffic' advisory followed by a Resolution Advisory (RA) commanding descent. Intruder was to our right and approximately below us. It did not make sense, but I followed the RA as required. A few seconds later TCAS reversed the command calling for a maximum TCAS climb which I immediately followed. The First Officer made the 2 appropriate 'TCAS descent' and 'TCAS climb' calls on Tower frequency. During the reversal the First Officer called out to me 'traffic close on right 200 FT below.' Within seconds after establishing the TCAS climb the event was over. Soon (seconds) thereafter I initiated a go-around because there was no way we were going to be able to get back to glideslope in a stabilized condition. We leveled at 10,000 FT, informed Tower and accepted vectors for another ILS 35L Approach which was normal. All proper TCAS maneuvers and Tower calls were made thus avoiding what really looked to us like a near midair situation. Tower never acknowledged our calls during the event. After leveling at 10,000 FT following the go-around I asked Tower about the position of the intruder aircraft. Tower said that the other aircraft was established on the Localizer for ILS 35R. I do not believe this was true. We had been established on and identified on the Localizer for ILS 35L since at least CPPER. It should be noted that the altitudes and positions noted in this report were reconstructed by myself and the First Officer following the event and were therefore approximate notes.		An A320 crew on the DEN 35L ILS took evasive action in response to a TCAS DESCEND command with lower abeam traffic on the 35R ILS, but the command reversed to the correct CLIMB command after about 10 seconds. A go-around was initiated at that point.

I selected Flaps 15 and, subsequently, the aircraft began to shake as though we had thrown a tread off the front tire of a pickup truck traveling 30 MPH.  The First Officer discontinued the descent and I immediately declared an emergency with Tower indicating we would be flying straight ahead.  We were completely unsure of the cause of the rhythmic shaking of the aircraft.  The First Officer asked if I wanted to fly the plane as we both had our hands on the controls, and I said, 'No, you fly the aircraft.'  I began to scan instruments and found both the N1 and EGT gauges for the number one engine completely shaded red indicating that limits had been or were being exceeded.   The First Officer called for the engine failure emergency action items and we shut down the number one engine.  When the start lever reached the cutoff position, we heard a loud bang, but the shaking subsided. The Tower asked if we wanted to land and that we could use any runway.  I considered 'engine failure in the approach configuration' procedure, but we were probably too high to land without additional flaps and elected to fly around the pattern.  Tower asked if we could climb and I asked the First Officer if he wanted to climb and he did so we accepted a clearance to 4,000 FT.  I asked the First Officer if he wanted to reconfigure and he said he would rather leave the flaps and gear as they were.  I set up flight director guidance for him and proceeded to accomplish items on the Engine Failure Checklist as we flew downwind for our second approach including bringing APU power to the number one bus.  I tested the fire system and it was normal, and did not want to fly any farther than necessary from the airport.  We were cleared to land and the First Officer continued flying until we were approximately 1,500 FT AGL.  I indicated to the First Officer that I would have to make the landing and inquired whether the aircraft was in trim before transferring control.  We were slightly fast, and I was distracted by not being able to reset my flight director as it would not capture the approach mode.  We were on speed, but I flew slightly below the glideslope probably because of the Flaps 15 attitude.  Landing was normal and, as we slowed, I asked the passengers to remain seated and told them we would be having the fire crew inspect the left engine.  I asked the flight attendants about the cabin; it was normal.  I asked the 'B' Flight Attendant to open the aft entry door to observe the number one engine.  He indicated that all appeared normal to him.  The fire crew also indicated that the engine appeared normal and I opened the cockpit window and saw nothing unusual.  We taxied to the gate and deplaned the passengers after I apologized for the unusual events.  I told them that I was uncertain what exactly had happened.  A deadheading Flight Attendant and several passengers told me that they observed shaking and flames coming from the number one engine in-flight.  I inspected the engine and found nothing unusual other than the sooty tailpipe. Maintenance Control indicated this morning to me that the engine would be changed and that perhaps one of the shafts had separated and thrown the engine out of balance causing the shaking we experienced.  If possible, I would like to know what is found during the tear-down.  I am quite surprised that the engine failed while idling; we normally expect to see this during acceleration and high output.  The event began with the selection of Flaps 15, which made our initial reaction to the event seem to be related to the airframe rather than the engine.  We obviously had several checklists to choose from.				A B737-700 Left Engine failed at idle during descent for landing but because the aircraft was high, a go-around was begun, the engine shutdown, an emergency was declared, the QRH completed, and an uneventful landing followed.

As I (pilot not flying) was reading and completing the QRH checklist items as the pilot flying continued to fly, I noticed that we were rapidly approaching Vmo and no longer in much of a climb. I informed the pilot flying of this information and the pilot flying said we were about to stall and proceeded to increase power. The Overspeed Warning is going off at this point. I crosschecked with standby ASI and ALT and told pilot flying that the standby and the pilot not flying instruments agreed. I told pilot flying to reduce power. The pilot flying then consulted the HUD and said the HUD showed impending stall as well. I told pilot flying to reduce power again and repeated that pilot not flying instruments and STBY were in agreement. Around FL250, the pilot flying agreed that the pilot flying's instruments were incorrect and the unreliable airspeed appropriate actions taken. We transferred control of the aircraft since I had the instruments we deemed to be correct. We asked ATC if we could level at FL280 due to equipment issues/RVSM restrictions and they agreed and even gave us a block from FL280-283. We leveled at FL280. The following Controller upon check-in queried our altitude at which point we realized that we had not switched our transponder to report altitude from #2. We told ATC, made appropriate switch, and ATC confirmed that we were at FL280. We completed/complied with all appropriate checklists and confirmed all circuit breakers were in. The pilot not flying then contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. It seemed that the issue trying to be resolved was that the #1 EEC could not be selected to the 'hard alternate mode,' not the fact that we had lost data inputs, possible computers, instruments and/or their capability. As the pilot not flying tried to resolve this with Dispatch/Maintenance, I (pilot flying now), began to check weather for diversion options. We still had the FMCs' navigation functioning; however, the data portion was obviously not working. Fortunately, we and Dispatch determined that we had enough fuel to continue to our filed destination at FL280. On descent through FL180, all systems began to function normally. We completed the flight uneventfully. We spoke with Maintenance and after 20 minutes or so they were diligently working on finding the problem. I couldn't stay any longer because I had to swap aircraft to fly two more legs. In respect to actions taken to prevent/handle situation, it would be beneficial if we as pilots could find out what actually malfunctioned in a far from normal 'non-normal' situation like this one.				During climb through FL200 both B737-700 engine EEC's transitioned to the Soft Alternate Mode with the Captain's airspeed indicating stall and an inaccurate transponder #1. ADIRU 2 data was functional and indicating an overspeed. Descending out of FL180 all systems returned to normal.

No fault alerts or warning lights were given. I transitioned duties of flying to the First Officer and worked the problem.  Uncertain if the issue was an IRS, FCC or something else, I declared an emergency and returned to the airport uneventfully.	The reporter stated that follow up on this event determined that the Number 1 ADIRU failed even though no fault annunciation was displayed. The Captain's PFD has the compass rose with tick markers, the speed and altitude tapes were displayed but no data accompanied the tapes. He did recall that even though the First Officer's Flight Director initially was lost, by the time they began the approach Flight Director information was again available. He said there was great deal of activity during the air turn back and he was basically without information to back up the First Officer during the night VMC return.			After takeoff a B737-800 Captain's PFD and HUD lost altitude, airspeed, vertical speed, FMA annunciations, the autothrottle/autopilot would not engage and the yaw damper disengaged. An emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

We were about 5 south of airport awaiting clearance from ATC for an approach. I noticed traffic at one o'clock departing the pattern at BIL climbing towards us on TCAS. As we proceeded the traffic continued towards us but ATC said nothing. We eventually got a TCAS climb and climbed approximately 4,500 per TCAS direction. The other traffic continued to climb into us on the TCAS. As I told ATC of the TCAS climb the Controller pointed us out as traffic to the aircraft causing our TCAS climb. I inquired if the other traffic was VFR or IFR and was told it was VFR. The Controller was controlling us and in radio contact with the other aircraft, but never attempted to prevent the TCAS event. As I watched the map display the other aircraft came within 400 FT of us on the TCAS. It's disconcerting that ATC did nothing to prevent this avoidable TCAS event.		[Report narrative contained no additional information.]		A320 Captain reports a TCAS RA approaching BIL at 7,000 FT with a VFR departure, both talking to ATC. ATC makes no attempt to prevent the conflict and the A320 climbs 4,500 FT at TCAS direction.

The aircraft was towed from Maintenance Hangar and a note left on center pedestal 'Do not move flaps due to ice on the wings.'  During the pre-flight I noticed about 3 inches of ice accumulation on the wing surface of both wings (mid chord to trailing edge). The flaps were left at 40 until the certified deicer deiced the aircraft wings and tail with Type 1. The certified deicer completed the deicing. I moved the flaps to 5 per the TPS. On takeoff we retracted the flaps on schedule. As we accelerated I noticed that we needed almost 3 units of rudder trim and still needed aileron trim to maintain heading. Once we leveled off I went to the back to check on the wings. By doing so I noticed the right TE Flap was not completely flushed up and 2 of the spoilers were out. We had no indications in the cockpit. The right TE flap was not up and not at 1, but the left flaps were viewed up. We declared an emergency and returned. Because of the unknown of structural damage we did the following procedure in the QRH, All flaps up landing. The landing was uneventful. Significant damage to the TE flap linkage.				B737-800 First Officer reports receiving an aircraft from Maintenance with ice on the wings and the flaps full down and a note not to move the flaps until the aircraft has been deiced. After de icing the flaps are set for takeoff and the flight departs. Once airborne the aircraft requires significant rudder and aileron trim to fly straight. A trip to the cabin by the First Officer reveals that the right TE flap is not fully retracted and that two spoilers are partially extended. An emergency is declared and the flight returns to the departure airport for flaps up landing.

At approximately 400 FT AGL, the pitch mode dropped out, causing the flight director to disappear.  The aircraft roll mode automatically went into HDG.  At about this time, I noticed that the Captain's Navigation Display (ND) started blanking out intermittently, just for a few seconds or less, for approximately one minute.  As this was occurring, my ND also began doing the same thing.  We leveled off at our assigned altitude of 3,000 FT, and everything seemed to stabilize.  The displays returned to normal and the instruments appeared to be reading true.  There were no cautions/warning to indicate any continuing problems, so we proceeded.  We continued our climb as instructed.  At approximately 12,000 FT, we began to experience the same issue with the ND displays again.  This time we were presented with a DISPLAY SOURCE annunciation on both sides.  We ran the QRH for the item and checked all of our DC and AC power sources, which all appeared normal. The DISPLAY SOURCE message cleared before we even were able to complete the QRH checklist.  The ND displays were once again back to normal and stable.  At 18,000 FT, when changing the altimeter setting, I noticed a brief intermittent freezing and releasing on my altimeter.  It only lasted for about five seconds and then seemed normal once again.  We continued the climb.  At approximately 30,000 FT, the ND displays once again began to flicker and blank out.  This was almost immediately followed by both the upper and lower engine instrument displays also blanking out intermittently.  I watched the engine displays closely, and they were not blanking out entirely at once. Only some of the gauges were blanking out at a time initially. Soon, however, those screens also completely blanked out.  At this point the PFDs also began blanking out intermittently.  All six displays were flashing on and off for a few seconds at a time.  At one point, I witnessed all six display screens black at the same time.  After a several moments, the screens returned to normal.  We made the decision at this point to return.  During our turn, the screens began blanking one last time, just for a few seconds.  After that, the displays remained on and normal for the remainder of the return flight. The Captain stated repeatedly that the HUD display was true and correct throughout the incident.  We were in night VMC conditions the entire time.				B737-700 First Officer experiences intermittent freezing and blanking of display screens from takeoff to FL300 where the decision is made to return to the departure airport.

We had some weather ahead that we decided to deviate around and climb above as well.  The autopilot and autothrottles were engaged in LNAV and VNAV and FMC modes.  We received a clearance and began to climb first and then entered a right 15 mile offset into the FMC.  The engines were not quite up to full climb N1 as the aircraft began the turn.  It banked directly to 30 degrees bank and we immediately felt an aerodynamic buffet.  I immediately put my hands on the controls and checked airspeed but left the autopilot on as by then the aircraft was approaching the offset heading (45 degrees from our original track) and began to roll out.  This stopped the buffet which lasted only 1-2 seconds.  Our speed was about 20 KIAS above the lower buffet margin (yellow band) and 15 KIAS below the upper yellow band.  I saw the red stall tape rising from the bottom (it was out of sight in level cruise) and it topped out approximately 10 KIAS below the yellow band.   We both immediately felt and identified the same thing: stall buffet.  As we approached the parallel course at 15 NM offset, we decided to use heading select limited to 10 degrees of bank to make the turn to prevent a reoccurrence. As we rolled onto the course we then put it back into LNAV.  This was a deviation from SOP AFTER the event to prevent a reoccurrence as we were unsure of why this had occurred and had not had time yet to process the likelihood of it happening again. We spent some time discussing the event and wondering why we got a buffet with such a large margin on the stall tape and why the autopilot would command 30 degrees of bank at 35,000 feet.  The autopilot commanded too high a bank angle at high altitude.  It appears that the FMC commands a 30 degree bank when using the offset mode regardless of the altitude.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AND NEEDS TO CHANGE.  If it is supposed to only use 23 degrees, then it should be reprogrammed to undershoot the bank and then correct up to it rather than allowing an overshoot in bank.  If the speed margins were smaller it could have caused a stall and upset. Additionally, the SOP of using ONLY LNAV in any and all situations in ETOPS/Oceanic ops needs to be reevaluated.  I understand the concept of threat reduction but when doing deviations for weather it unnecessarily complicates the task which introduces a whole bunch of other threats.  You have to use offset (which uses 45 degree off course turns; what if I need to turn only 30 degrees?) and potentially stair step your way around the storm or you have to figure out by trial and error a LAT/LONG that happens to sit between the moving TS cells.	Reporter states that company procedures have been changed to allow manual entry and exit from offset routes (not due to his experience). He is still curious why buffet was encountered with IAS 10 knots above the yellow band. The B737NG FMC is designed to enter and exit offset routes using up to a 30 degree bank angle regardless of the altitude.	During cruise flight over the ocean in ETOPS airspace we detected weather ahead. We asked for and received a clearance for a deviation right of course. We were below optimum altitude due to ATC so we also asked for and received a clearance to climb 1,000 feet to our new optimum altitude. We had a very comfortable and wide airspeed envelope between the high and low limits displayed on the airspeed tape. We programmed the FMC for the new altitude and we started the climb first, then we programmed R15 (right 15 miles) and executed that. Per our company procedures we stayed in LNAV and let the autopilot fly the deviation. As soon as we executed the deviation the aircraft rolled quickly to 30 degrees of bank and we immediately felt an aerodynamic buffet. This got our attention real quick and I immediately glanced at the airspeed indicator which showed the yellow band coming up from the bottom but we were still at least 20 KIAS above the yellow band. I contemplated pushing the nose down or reducing the bank angle with force on the yoke and/or disconnecting the autopilot but I didn't want to risk aggravating the situation with a large control input. Also by then the aircraft was starting to come out of the turn and of course the buffet immediately went away. At no time did the airspeed ever get even close to the high or low yellow buffet band, and yet there is no question that I felt an aerodynamic buffet. There are two issues here. One, according to the 737NG systems handbook, LNAV bank angles are limited to 'not more than 23 degrees' and yet the autopilot took the plane quickly to a full 30 degrees and held it there. Later on this same flight I noted that when making LNAV course changes (even large course changes), the aircraft banked at 23 degrees. For some reason when doing a course offset, it went to a full 30 degrees of bank. I have noticed other aircraft overbanking to approximately 27 degrees and then shallowing out the bank to 23 degrees and holding it there. I would think that above 20,000 feet it would be better to under bank rather than over bank initially and then fine tune from there. The second issue is what the airspeed indicator was showing. The 737NG systems handbook says the yellow band on the airspeed indicator shows 'low and high speed buffet margins' and the note says '1.3 G maneuver capability occurs at 40 degrees of bank in level flight.' I know we weren't in level flight but we were established in a climb and we were nowhere close to 40 degrees of bank, and we were also nowhere close to the yellow band on the airspeed tape, so why did we get the aerodynamic buffet? I think the requirement to do all ETOPS deviations in LNAV needs to be re-evaluated. An LNAV track offset only gives you one option and that's a 45 degree turn off course. What if I need 25 degrees to go between cells? Secondly if you need to fine tune your offset you get large heading changes (45 degrees again) and large bank angles that are unnecessary and sometimes downright dangerous, especially if you're in turbulence which is obviously common when deviating around thunderstorms. Not only that but creating offsets is a whole lot more work and button pushing that in itself introduces threats and errors which I think are more hazardous than the potential to forget you're not in LNAV. It also causes you to be heads down typing when you could be easily navigating between cells, heads up, and using the heading select option to smoothly avoid the cells.		B737-800 flight crew reports encountering aerodynamic buffet at FL350 as a 15 NM offset is entered and executed in the FMC. The aircraft had rolled into a 30 degree bank to track 45 degrees off the course line and intercept the offset.  The indicated airspeed remained 10 knots above the yellow band on the airspeed tape during the maneuver and the reason for aerodynamic buffet could not be explained.

The Captain was the pilot flying and noted that his elevator trim switch was intermittent. After our initial level off, the Captain engaged Autopilot A. Within a few minutes we noted the Stab Out of Trim light had illuminated, but extinguished within approximately 10 seconds as the autopilot began to trim the aircraft once again. A few minutes later the light illuminated again. We also noted a momentary Speed Trim Fail light. The Stab Out of Trim light illuminated and extinguished again several times.The Captain asked me to run the Stabilizer Out of Trim Checklist from the QRH. As I was running the checklist, the autopilot kicked off and the trim wheel had stopped moving. The Captain noted heavy down force pressure on the control column as he flew the aircraft by hand. He slowed the aircraft to around 270-280 KTS to lighten the control column pressure. I completed the Stabilizer Out of Trim Checklist and began the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative Checklist. ATC was step-climbing us behind another aircraft and the constant radio calls, climbs and level offs were very distracting. By the time we realized the extent of our malfunction, we were half way to our destination. We were only able to trim nose down, either manually with the trim wheel or with the electric trim switches. I discovered that I was able to move the trim wheel nose up, a little at a time, if I moved the trim wheel very slightly nose down first. But we moved it only enough to keep the aircraft controllable because it was binding. After completing the first portion of the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative Checklist, we traded off hand-flying the aircraft. We contacted Dispatch and determined it would be best to continue to our filed destination. We declared an emergency with Center, and once with Approach Control, requested vectors for a 10-mile straight-in to Runway XXL. The airport was landing another runway, but Runway XX gave us an additional 3,083 FT and worked with the winds. The Captain discussed the situation with the flight attendants after we had determined our course of action and had me convey to them that we anticipated a normal landing after we were fully configured and the aircraft was controllable. We determined to not notify the passengers. We completed all required items on the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative Checklist and landed without incident. Once cleared by the responding emergency vehicles, the Captain taxied the aircraft to the gate.		The First Officer's report is exactly how it happened. My only question is why is the stab clutch disconnect switch only mentioned in the jammed Flight Control Checklist for aileron, elevator and rudder. I guess Boeing figures the stabilizers to be a secondary flight control. It is never referred to in the Stab Trim Inoperative Checklist. Only on left side of QRH for jammed or restricted flight control for aileron, elevator or rudder. No mention for Stab Checklist.

I then engaged the 'B' autopilot and re-engaged the autothrottle. We then ran the Drive Light and Source Off Light Checklists per the QRH. Since the APU had been deferred we decided to return to our departure airport, due to having only one electrical power source remaining.  We coordinated our return with ATC, then notified Dispatch, the flight attendants, and our customers of the situation. We also ran the Diversion Checklist. The weather remained VMC throughout the flight. We flew an uneventful approach and landing. We were not overweight upon landing, and Maintenance personnel met us at the gate. We did not declare an emergency.		The weather remained VMC throughout the flight.		Dispatched with an inoperative APU the flight crew of a B737NG was forced to return to their departure airport when the left generator drive and source off lights illuminated thus rendering them with only a single AC electrical source.

The First Officer set 1,500 feet in MCP window and started a slow Vertical Speed descent from 3,000 feet. At approximately 1,800 MSL the Obstacle Alert sounded. The First Officer leveled [the] aircraft. I then took manual control and initiated a climb. The EGPWS changed to a PULL UP Alert. I pitched up and rapidly increased thrust to correct the flight path (go-around started). Once we climbed to approximately 2,300 FT, conditions returned to normal. We then decided to restart the [descent]; the First Officer became flying pilot again and continued the approach to landing.		While descending to 1,500 MSL (the FAF alt) on an extended left base to a visual approach for Runway 10, we received an Obstacle Alert.After climbing approximately 300 FT, the alerts subsided and the approach was continued uneventfully. Simultaneously, as we were executing the procedure, we noticed several towers in our vicinity and assume that was the cause of our alert.A more detailed chart review would have revealed the towers' existence and resulted in an intermediate level off until they were visually identified.		While descending on a base leg direct to the FAF, cleared for a visual approach to Runway 10 at BWI and planning to cross the FAF at the ILS charted 1,500 MSL the flight crew of a B737NG experienced an EGPWS terrain warning and directive to 'pull up'. They did so and, when the alarm silenced continued to a safe landing.

We all laugh, and expect changes in the arrival procedures into LAX.  This event illustrates the danger that we are faced with.  On our arrival, we had planned a 280 KT descent to comply with speed at KONZL.  During our descent, we were slowed from 280 to 260.  During a descent, it is difficult to slow and stay on descent path.  Our aircraft was heavy and not slowing very well.  After passing KONZL, we were given descent via, but sped up to 280 again.  Another programming requirement while complying with the various altitudes.  Shortly thereafter, we were slowed to 250.  After jumping through hoops with the FMC programming, were slowed to 230, then 170.  All with a 30 KT tailwind, attempting to maintain altitude restrictions as well as put the aircraft in a position to be stabilized on final approach.  During the arrival, the speed changes were so drastic, I went to the old school method of stepping to the next altitude and turned off the automation.  I can appreciate automation, but when confronted with the rapid speed change requirements on an LNAV/VNAV arrival, the task at hand becomes quite daunting and even confusing.  We were tired, but we both recognized the futility of trying to make automation work, so we reverted to old school procedures.  My point here is not to show my superiority, but to point out that the numerous speed changes we are frequently faced with are distracting and possibly dangerous.  I don't want to be the Crew that is too absorbed in making the automation work that they forget to fly the aircraft.  SoCal needs to pick a speed and go with it.  Multiple speed changes on an arrival lead to non-compliance with chart restrictions and could lead to a dangerous flight condition.  The situation doesn't sound that bad here on paper, but it is a concern, and I think that if we don't speak up to ATC, then to them it is tacit approval to continue with this dangerous practice.				B737 Captain laments the speed changes issued by ATC during the SEAVU 2 RNAV arrival to LAX.

As I recall, when we first noticed the imbalance after receiving the caution, we had about 7,300 LBS in the left main and 6,100 LBS in the right with the right going down quickly. We started with the Fuel Imbalance Alert Checklist in the QRH. As we worked through the possible causes listed in the checklist, we enlisted the help of a Captain that was jumpseating and riding in the back to help us look for visible signs of a fuel leak. As he was looking for that out the passenger windows, we tried the crossfeed valve and it appeared to work correctly; meanwhile, the right tank was going down at a rate of double or a little faster than double of the left tank. The jumpseating Captain then joined us on the flight deck as we decided an extra opinion and help would be beneficial. It was determined that it would be necessary to continue to the Engine Fuel Leak Checklist. By this time we had climbed to and leveled off at FL350. As we looked ahead at the checklist and saw that it mandated an engine shutdown, we declared an emergency with Center and coordinated our return to the departure airport. We were now heading west back when I ran the Engine Fuel Leak Checklist. That checklist then refers to the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist. I read through every item and every note in all the checklists and conferred with both these Captains to ensure that we weren't missing something or misdiagnosing the problem before we shut down that #2 Engine. All three of us agreed that the fuel was going down on the right side at a rapid rate and it warranted continuing with the Shutdown Checklist. At this time, as I recall, we had about 6,900 in the left tank and about 5,400 in the right. The checklist was run and the right engine was shutdown. We made a long slow controlled descent back into the runway with no further incident. We were greeted by the fire trucks, informed Tower that we needed no further assistance, and proceeded to the gate where we were met by several Maintenance personnel, a Chief Pilot and several other people. After our long descent with the right motor shut down, upon arrival at the gate, the fuel gauges were nearly equal again. We had time on our next deadhead flight to review what we'd done. The question comes to mind that what if it was an issue with the fuel crossfeed valve that we somehow overlooked? We feel that we checked it adequately during the event enough to rule it out, but the possibility exists. We feel that if anything we erred to the side of safety in making an air return. We did have questions about why the engine shutdown was mandated through the series of checklists, but can only assume it is to reduce the chance of fire from not knowing where the fuel leak could be. I felt good about our CRM, teamwork, and the added benefit of having an additional Captain helping back up our decisions.	The reporter stated that no mechanical faults were found and in the final analysis Maintenance assumed that for an unknown reason the fuel crossfeed valve did not close completely which allowed the right tank to feed both engines. The reporter stated however that the crew operated the crossfeed valve several times during troubleshooting and it appeared to operate normally with the light either OFF, BRIGHT OR DIM when in the commanded position.	During step climb to cruise, Master Caution illuminated and a fuel imbalance alert was identified: left 7,300 LBS, right 6,100 LBS. I asked deadheading Captain to assist with a visual inspection of the #2 Engine and wing area to determine if there was an external fuel leak. None found. Captain then joined crew in cockpit. First Officer referred to QRH for Fuel Imbalance Alert Checklist, as directed, and we began to address the fuel problem. After going through that checklist, the fuel imbalance increased to: left 6,900 LBS, right 5,400 LBS. A fuel audit showed approximately the correct fuel for our position; however, the bulk of the fuel was coming from the right main tank. The cross feed and fuel pump operations all indicated they were functioning normally.We proceeded with the Engine Fuel Leak Checklist because of the increasing imbalance. We requested return to the departure station, declared an emergency, shutdown #2 Engine, per the QRH, and landed.		A B737-700 FUEL MASTER CAUTION alerted when the right tank fuel quantity decreased more quickly than the left tank and after completing the Fuel Leak Checklist the crew shutdown the right engine, declared an emergency and returned to the departure airport. A faulty crossfeed valve was suspected.

We ran QRH, Resets, Normal Checklists and consulted the AOM. The only guidance we found was in the AOM. It dealt with the number 1 or 2 reverser fault. The action was to reduce thrust in the right engine. We called Dispatch and Maintenance and consulted as to the correct course of action. We involved a phone patch with our Fleet Manager. With their concurrence we confirmed and reduced thrust on the Number 2 Engine to idle. As a precaution and to ensure priority handling we declared an emergency with ATC. The AOM guidance included language to land at the nearest suitable airport. By the time we had the situation under control we were only about fifty mile from the destination airport and still about 25,000 FT MSL. We felt the best course of action was to continue our descent and prepare for a straight in landing. It was already programmed and the runway is over 11,000 in length and 200 FT wide. We felt confident that this was the correct course of action. We used the single engine guidance from the AOM and did a flap three landing. The emergency was really a non event with a positive outcome.				A320 First Officer experiences a reverser fault during descent. After consulting the QRH, AOM and Maintenance Control the crew elects to reduce the engine to idle and continue to destination after declaring an emergency.

It was only a 200-LBS imbalance, but it was clearly getting worse. We checked the crossfeed and the light didn't work using the lights test and then looked up where the circuit breaker was. The circuit breaker was tripped (it's right by the shoulder harness). Right as we noticed this, the fuel imbalance indicator turned Amber, we had gone from 200 LBS to 1,000 LBS in the time it took to look up and check the breaker. We used ACARS to ask Dispatch for advice from Maintenance Control, who replied, 'follow QRH' with no additional comment. This is where this report is important: the QRH procedure does not work, it is incorrect. The QRH has two lines of logic, one with the breaker tripped, one without. The old QRH was simpler: 'fuel balance maintain.' The QRH has been changed, probably to deal with the crews that mistakenly performed engine shutdowns for using the fuel leak procedure for this same circuit breaker problem. The difficulty is the new procedure doesn't work in the air. It tells you to check the breaker (good), but then it gives this instruction: Verify that sufficient fuel is available to both engines to complete the flight. There is no way of either a) knowing if the imbalance was going to drain a tank or b) if it didn't, know that control could be maintained with a severely out-of-balance aircraft. Remember, we were at 1,000 LBS of imbalance within just a couple minutes of noticing: we had 50 minutes to go, to land at absolute destination airport minimums. The nearest airport with good weather was more than an hour away. I suspect this QRH procedure was created in the simulator. In the airplane, once it starts getting out of balance, it gets worse very quickly. The wrench in the works is Note 2, 'It is not possible to determine the position of the fuel crossfeed valve.' They took out 'maintain fuel balance', the old procedure, presumably because there is no way to know if the valve is open enough to be able to safely shut off pumps to one tank at altitude. We did not want to do this, we were at 38,000 FT. However, following the circuit breaker tripped logic; the QRH had a hard [stop]. This is one of the times I felt like I was out of options. The destination was at minimums, (300-1, the lowest for Runway 4), there was nothing below us that was good, our alternate was more than an hour away and I was now over 1,500 LBS of imbalance and getting worse by the minute. Adjusting rudder trim to lift the heavy wing didn't make a difference. There was zero chance that I could make it to destination with more than minimum fuel in the low tank, it was possible it could even run dry (remember, we're already in the Amber 'IMBAL'). If the imbalance got to 4,000 LBS, or 3,000 or whatever, I assumed the autopilot would kick off and the airplane would be difficult to control. It was possible I was going to miss the approach into our destination regardless, since weather was at minimums with freezing drizzle. Shooting an approach to 300 FT with a huge weight imbalance, then diverting, no way. So now what? We agonized over the breaker. Is 'fuel crossfeed' the same as a 'fuel control' circuit breaker? I've been flying Boeings for 20 years and I don't know the answer. We both agreed it wasn't, but either way, I am loathe to touch any breaker that says 'fuel.' Do I crossfeed, and run the chance that the crossfeed is only partially open and I flame out an engine? The QRH certainly does not call for crossfeeding. Do I divert? I can't, my alternate is an hour away and I have no intention of letting the imbalance get more than 500 more pounds, since I don't know how the airplane will handle; it was already flying sideways at 1,500. Even if there was a closer 'nearest suitable', from 38,000 FT the imbalance would put one tank into 'min gas' and give me a possible controllability problem. This was one of those times when QRH procedures didn't match real life. I had no tools to 'verify if sufficient fuel is available to both engines to complete the flight,' I don't know how to do that. How fast is the imbalance going to progress? I assume it gets faster as the wing gets heavier. I don't know how many minutes I have for it to get to emergency fuel. I don't know where my destination is, is it ZZZ or ZZZ1? Nearest suitable off-line that was above minimums? What if I missed the approach? The QRH doesn't say what to do next. It gives an impossible instruction ('determine something you can't determine with the tools you have') then doesn't tell you what to do next. Divert to nearest suitable? Doesn't say that. Mine was upstate [far distance from destination], so not an option. Fuel balance: manage? Doesn't say that. Reset the breaker? Doesn't say that either. In the end, we read (out loud) the QRH instructions about resetting circuit breakers. 'An in-flight reset should only be accomplished if, in the judgment of the Captain, regaining use of that system is critical to the safe conduct of flight.' I determined that the safest course of action was to attempt a reset, then the second safest was to attempt to manage imbalance by shutting off fuel pumps, and the third safest to continue on with no action. I reset the breaker (the crossfeed operated normally) I contacted Maintenance Control on the ground and made the Info Only write-up after explaining my decision process, and proceeded on. The QRH procedure needs to be updated to list the options in order of desirability: a) reset breaker, b) risk flameout by turn off fuel pumps to manage fuel or c) immediately land at nearest suitable (which wouldn't have worked in my case due to low weather). There isn't time to do anything else other than these three. Including guidance on how to determine 'sufficient' fuel would help as well.				A B737-700 crew discovers a fuel imbalance while in cruise at FL380. With the Fuel Crossfeed Circuit breaker tripped and because the QRH does not address all reset possibilities, destination weather was at minimums and arrival fuel would be at minimum safe quantity, the Captain reset the Cross Feed circuit which corrected the problem.

Finally gave us HF frequency. About that time my crew meal came up, I began to eat and the relief pilot called Gander radio, advised we were CPDLC and requested a SELCAL check; but it did not register with me that he did not specifically request an oceanic clearance. Shortly, after crossing the FIR boundary, we received SELCAL and were given an oceanic clearance. Poor HF made the process very difficult but finally heard 'readback correct.'		What followed throughout the remaining time span contained within this report was a virtual constant struggle to obtain and maintain a clearly understandable HF communication with Iceland. Static, in/out fad, and weak signals were dominant. With the Oceanic Clearance, and multiple HF SELCALS from Iceland, numerous attempts on primary, secondary, and other frequencies printed on the Navigation charts were attempted. The secondary frequency of 11279 was totally unusable, and 8879, 8891, 4675, 5649, and 5616 were also utilized to no avail. After much difficulty an Oceanic Clearance was received and read back on HF 8864.During this HF fiasco, both CPDLC and ADS either dropped offline or were intermittent. At no point in this process was a route flown other than what the clearance that was understood by this crew.		Flight deck confusion and intermittent communications with ATC resulted in a B777 entering oceanic airspace without a clearance.

We hit severe turbulence for 15 minutes followed by continuous MOD TURB. It lasted nearly 30-45 minutes. When my break was over I returned to cockpit. They told me they gained/ lost 100 FT and it set off the overspeed warning horn for 4-5 seconds. They did not know how much the VMO exceedance was because of the side to side and up down motion of the turbulence. Prior to flight the weather picture showed a severe blob of weather. But the flight plan has notes telling pilots to not even ask for [the normal alternate routing around] Mendoza valley then up the Pacific. The flight plan notes discourage pilots from even asking for [company specific alternate routing]. We are told in ground school it is only 100 miles difference. Yet the flight plan notes say that route costs $9K to 16,000 dollars more. I find that hard to believe.  Net result we scared a full flight of CUSTOMERS because some guy who sits at a desk and has never flown this route decided to write notes on the flight plan demanding that pilots disregard safety. Please look at the notes on the flight plan. Fleet CA 777/787 and some other guy wrote these notes DO NOT ASK DISPATCHER FOR [alternate routing].  This was the one time that if I'd been the CA I would have called and asked for [the alternate routing]. I know this sounds harsh, but I am a Captain in training. And things like safe flight planning must prevail. The pilots told me they deviated more than 100 NM around this weather and even that was not enough.				B777 Relief Pilot reports encountering severe turbulence while he is in the bunk. The area of severe turbulence was known prior to departure but the Dispatcher did not plan around it and the crew was discouraged from requesting a different route.

The aircraft began an uncommanded right turn which the crew noticed immediately and corrected back onto the arrival by disconnecting the autopilot. The next waypoint was in fact the next point in the FMC. ATC commented on our right turn but we were already correcting and reissued clearance.Automation failure. Three crewmembers verified that the FMC was programmed correctly for the arrival. Uncommanded turn occurred after discontinuity closed and close to the waypoint.

The PDC was not available so the clearance was read over the radio. The initial part of the clearance was read and then an 'as filed' was given for the remainder. The pilot not flying entered KU03O in the route instead of KU03M and entered PDT based on the canned flight plan used on other flights. The pilot flying did not verify the entire route of flight as the De-ice Coordinator entered the cockpit and interrupted our checklist. They de-ice aircraft at the gate in [our departure airport], so we had to initiate communication with the truck and configure the aircraft for de-ice. Enroute we caught the discrepancy as we approached KU03O and requested direct to JKNOX. We were approximately 3 miles off course as we were cleared to JKNOX and the HHOOD arrival. The route of flight was input incorrectly into the FMC and a full route cross verification was not completed by the other pilot on the ground.				A B737NG flight crew failed to manually enter their aurally transmitted clearance into their FMS and a minor track deviation occurred prior to their discovering of the error.

The flight time was 1:22 with light to moderate turbulence and mountain wave during the descent into Denver. The First Officer is on high minimums. I believe he did not have a lot of experience using FMC in complex arrival settings. The Captain was new to the seat. During a short time we had 3 runway changes, 2 SID transition changes and numerous airspeed and altitude changes that did correspond with the airspeed and altitudes and the actual MOLTN 2 arrival. The 3rd runway change was the RNAV Z (RNP) 34R. The weather was clear and this was our 3rd flight together. The CRM setting was above average between the two crew members. The airplane has speed and altitude intervention.  The error occurred on the MOLTN 2 arrival. We had the arrival programmed with no transition in place since we were given [Runway] 35L. About 10 miles from HIMOM ATC changed to RNAV 34R. The pilot flying was looking for charts and pilot not flying was watching airplane. We were then given the clearance cleared RNAV Z 34R HIMOM transition. The pilot flying came back and programmed the FMC and when he moved HIMOM up he put HIMOM on top of HIMOM when there is a discontinuity and I verified and he executed. Since we didn't put HIMOM in the discontinuity boxes it defaulted to the previous route. The error occurred when the pilot not flying was running the Approach Checklist running through the RNP procedures and didn't monitor. We flew past HIMOM to KALME instead of turning on the transition. ATC asked if we had field in sight and cleared us for visual approach. We landed uneventfully and there was no traffic conflict. I debriefed the First Officer on the FMC issues and my failure as a Captain to let him get overwhelmed by the ever changing clearances. I wanted him to get experience programming and changing the box instead having him fly the aircraft and the pilot not flying help out with more of the duties.	The reporter stated that because the FMS arrival programming was complete for the MOLTN TWO RNAV with the Runway 34L ILS the aircraft was supposed to fly HIMOM, KALME, WASKL then a heading for vectors to the ILS. When ATC changed to approach to the RNAV (RNP) Z RWY 34R, the FMS reloaded the entire MOLTN TWO RNAV and the FMS alerted using RSVR FUEL because of the added distance it had calculated. If left alone the aircraft would fly back to the MOLTN waypoint and re-fly the entire arrival. The end result was the First Officer had to go back and delete all of the waypoints up to HIMOM and then close the Route Discontinuity between HIMOM on the STAR and HIMOM on the RNAV Z approach. Essentially two MOLTN TWO Stars were in the FMS. In this case the aircraft continued to KALME because the FMS could not be programmed quickly enough to fly the clearance. The reporter commented that ATC should understand that when a runway and/or approach change is given the flight crew needs several minutes of FMS programming work before the aircraft is capable of flying an approach utilizing automation. In addition, the programming for an RNAV (RNP) approach requires disabling DME,DME updating and setting the RNP parameters in the FMS. That takes additional time because the correct FMS pages first have to be located, then the data entered. It would best if ATC could make no runway/approach changes late in the arrival sequence or if a change is necessary put the aircraft on a heading, so the crew can go heads down to make the necessary changes.	During preflight, DEN ATIS reported arrival Runways 16R, and I believe 17L and R. Flight plan had us arriving from West, so we selected 16R. I pulled out all three approach plates to south-landing runways. Approaching Top of Descent, the winds changed and so did the runways. Our runway was now changed to 34L. Fine, winds change, runway did too. After I pulled out the ILS plates to all north-landing runways, we reloaded the arrival runway, checked the arrival routing, altitude/speed restrictions, approach routing and altitudes then briefed the approach. Descending thru about 19K, (DEN at 5,350ish), ATC told us to expect landing on Runway 35R. Again we changed runways in the box, checked the box, briefed the approach. Shortly there after, ATC changed landing runway back to 34L and issued clearance for RNAV approach. I had 6 approach plates out by now and this wasn't one of them. We were in IMC, in typical DEN turbulence and ensuring RNAV approach procedures in QRH were complied with. We broke out at about 9-10K. It was clear below and we were then offered and cleared for a visual approach to Runway 34L. Being cleared for visual approach indicates to me that congestion was minimal. While there may have been extenuating ATC circumstances that we were unaware of, I heard no mention of emergencies on the frequency, Controller didn't sound like congestion was an issue, it appeared to me that unnecessary indecisiveness in runway selection was the culprit in this situation.		B737NG flight crew arriving DEN report a track deviation due to multiple ATC adjustments during the arrival, transition changes and three runway changes. The HIMON transition to the RNAV Z 34L is not correctly entered in the FMC and when detected by ATC, the crew is offered a visual approach.

Aircraft encountered wake turbulence. [We] could not maintain altitude, pitch or roll [and] abruptly lost approximately 300 FT, rolled left and right, pitched nose down. [We] turned off course [and] recovered control of aircraft. Informed ATC, passengers, and flight crew reported no injuries. Landed and received ACARS message for Severe Turbulence Logged incident in logbook. ATC caused this by too close spacing. Also, no wind at altitude was a major contribution. Amazing that 24 hours later, same flight, same place, ATC tried to put the flight too close to 777 heavy, different winds. ATC needs more spacing.		We were at level flight at 10,000 FT, clean configuration, 250 KTS, inside of FLIPR on the FLIPR 2 arrival. I noticed an aircraft 8 miles ahead of us about 11,000 FT descending. I asked ATC the aircraft type and they responded it was a 747. I noticed there were calm winds so I began a speed reduction to 220 KTS to provide for more spacing. We continued and a few moments later we ran into the 747 wake turbulence. The aircraft rolled sharp right pitched down and began to lose altitude. I corrected as trained we lost about 400 FT, and were off course about 30 degrees about a 340 degree heading. We contacted ATC got a lower altitude to 8,000 FT and than a turn to 280 degrees heading off course. To my knowledge no one was hurt. The seat belt sign was on and all flight attendants were in their seats.I wish ATC would let you know when you are behind a Heavy and not only when there is minimum separation of 5 miles. This way the pilot could better look at all the factors such as wind at altitude, the heavies relationship to your aircraft to name a few. I feel 10 miles should be a minimum for separation behind a Heavy.		B737-800 flight crew reported wake vortex encounter in trail of a B747-400 on arrival to MIA that resulted in loss of pitch and roll control and 300 FT altitude excursion.

Weather was 1,000 FT overcast in rain at dusk. While decelerating after touchdown Tower said to, 'Turn right on Charlie 7 high speed and contact Ground.' At approximately 50 KTS we exited on the high speed and I looked down to tune in Ground frequency. Approximately 150 FT into the high-speed the Captain stopped aircraft due to orange chalks crossing taxiway. It was discovered that the high-speed taxiway we were on was actually C6, which is NOT depicted on our 10-9 page. Unable to turn around we requested a tug to push us back onto the runway and taxied to the gate without incident. Although the NOTAMs stated that there were numerous taxiways under construction, no specifics were listed. Given that standard practice after landing is to exit the runway on the first available taxiway, nothing seemed unusual about Tower's directions to 'exit the high speed and contact Ground.' Since there is ONLY ONE high speed depicted on our Airport Diagram nothing seemed unusual, until we saw the barricades. While the obvious conclusion is that we failed to follow the specific instructions of the Tower by exiting the C7 high speed and not C6, my concern is that this could very easily happen again for the following reasons: 1) First, and foremost, this high-speed taxiway is not even depicted on the 10-9 page. While there are gray 'X's around, they don't give a good idea of what is actually there. There is no dirt or obvious signs of construction, rather a completed high-speed taxiway system that looks exactly like any other. We even specifically briefed a right hand turn off on the high speed. 2) We landed at dusk, in the rain with both wipers going continuously. Tower gave us instructions while we were decelerating, verifying speedbrakes and reverser deployment and making required speed callouts. While we both heard the general instructions we did not perceive that he was issuing very specific routing. And having easily slowed to normal taxi speed we just did what we do everyday, took the next available high-speed taxiway off the runway. 3) There were no obvious barriers preventing us from turning onto a closed taxiway. If fact, the tail of the aircraft was completely clear of the runway before we encountered the 6 foot tall chalks crossing the taxiway. Reduced visibility, during a rain shower at dusk, made it hard to see any obstructions at all. Had it been daylight we might have seen their orange color in the distance or at night their flashing lights. As it was, we felt fortunate to have been proceeding slowly enough to react in time prevent us from running over them altogether. 4) This was my first time ever to this field and I have not encountered anything like this before. My feeling is that the Tower Controller could have helped prevent the situation by using verbiage such as: 'the 2nd high- speed' or 'continue down to the C7 high-speed,' etc. We often times are issued instructions during high-speed rollout and have to put responding on hold until we've got things satisfactorily under control. It is an obvious time of distraction for pilots to receive specific instructions to commit to memory. If one is extremely familiar with the standard taxi routing of a particular airport it's normally not a problem. But in our case, what seemed routine, actually became very confusing. This is not to shift blame to anyone else, only to prevent a similar occurrence from happening to the next unsuspecting crew unfamiliar with the particular nuances of this airport.		This was a landing in the rain around dusk, which made the visibility very poor. Taxiway C6 is not depicted on the Jepp plate and was not NOTAMed closed or listed as closed on the ATIS. The only high speed taxiway on the Jepp 10-9 page is for C7. I assumed after landing and rolling down the runway that this was the only high speed exit available, and did not see the chalks across the taxiway because they were well back from Runway 28L (these chalks were about 140 feet from runway edge). It was not dark enough to see the portable lights on the chalks, or light enough outside to see the chalks from the runway. After tug pushed us back, we taxied to the gate.Taller, more visible barricades and moving them closer to runway would help. Better information from ATIS or ATC tower that the only high speed open was C7. The high speed C6 was not depicted on Jepp 10-9, therefore I was only expecting to see one high speed exit.		A flight landed on CMH Runway 28L at dusk in rain and exited onto a closed taxiway after being cleared to exit on the next Taxiway C7. The barricades were not seen until they were on the closed taxiway well clear of the runway.

The forecast for our arrival time was 400/1 and well within our landing minimums for the RNAV approach. When we were approximately within 600 miles of the airport the weather had deteriorated to VV 100 and 1/16 of a mile. I notified Dispatch that this made any approach impossible and that I felt it was time to divert to our alternate airport. The new forecast did not have the weather improving to RNAV landing minimums until XA:00 CST. I was informed that he would like me to continue in hopes of improvement. We were within 200 miles of the alternate and moving further away as we flew. After another ACARS message to company I was informed that I was to continue on and hold for an hour and then divert. As we got closer, the weather was still not improving, so I decided to contact Dispatch. At this time I made it clear that there was no way to land in this weather with the downgraded conditions of our aircraft. He felt that by that time we would be able to shoot the RNAV if there were no simultaneous approaches being conducted. I was told to continue on and hold and hope for better weather. When we arrived in the terminal area we were placed in holding and I once again contacted Dispatch via ACARS. I was then told to refer to the chart for the RNAV. I was then told that my landing minimums were RVR 2400 with no simultaneous approaches. I explained that the minimums for us were RVR 4000. We were not category A or B aircraft and that the best visibility on the field was only RVR 1200. He then wanted me to try the approach and if I went missed to continue on to my alternate. At this point I felt there was a lack of understanding of how poor the weather was and decided to depart for the alternate before something bad happened. Upon arrival at the alternate, maintenance met the aircraft. The aircraft was restored to CAT 3 status and we departed for our original destination. We shot a CAT 3 autoland and the weather was VV100 and RVR 1100. We did not see the runway until 50 feet and would never have gotten in on the RNAV. When I got to the gate I was told MX had been waiting all night for us because our aircraft had all the MX parts for RON aircraft. I suddenly got the feeling that this may have been the reason for all the pressure to get in at all cost. I don't feel Dispatch had any malice in pushing me, I just feel he was pressured to get us in. I had notified them that the aircraft was downgraded and my First Officer was high minimums on his first trip out of OE. I had a MX Supervisor on the aircraft the whole time and he couldn't believe the aircraft was not signed off before being dispatched into that kind of weather. I don't really have any suggestions on how to fix this type of problem. I just hope the next guy doesn't shoot an approach that is illegal because of being pressured. I would hate for someone to lose their license or worse.				A320 Captain reports being dispatched in an aircraft downgraded to CAT I with weather forecast to be above approach minimums. Enroute the weather goes below minimums and a diversion is requested from Dispatch but denied. After holding with no improvement, Dispatch suggests that the Captain attempt an approach with the weather below applicable minimums. The Captain diverts to his alternate.

We were progressing on the SWFFT ONE Arrival to BNA/Runway 31. ATC cleared us to the ONUGE intersection and to track in the Localizer to 31, which we did. An opening in the cloud base gave us a view to a Runway 31. I reported to Tower field was in sight. Tower immediately replied cleared the visual approach to Runway 31. Aircraft was level at 4,000 feet MSL and the glideslope had not even started to come down. Visually the runway appeared in front of us through the broken layer of clouds. We were getting much too high for a stable approach. I stated to the Captain something was wrong, but I was confused by what I saw outside and what the ILS was telling me. Captain called for the gear down and I lowered the gear handle. I think the Captain keyed the radio and told the BNA Tower we were too high for the runway and turned the aircraft to the left, off the Localizer. We might have lost 100 in altitude as well, but the Tower responded that we were not high and asked if we were lining up on Smyrna's runway? Captain immediately turned the aircraft back to the right and centered up the Localizer again. He quickly climbed back to 4,000 FT and followed the ILS approach to Runway 31. I responded to the Tower something like, 'Yes, we lined up on the wrong runway.' At that point, I could see BNA Airport further ahead on the horizon. We flew the visual approach to Runway 31 at BNA with no further incident. We rushed through the instrument briefing prior to our descent into Nashville. It was the first time for me to fly that arrival from the southeast and land on Runway 31. The Captain failed to mention there was a note on the approach plate about confusing MQY Runway for BNA's runway ten miles to the southeast. I failed to see the same warning too. Every approach should be given enough thought about what could happen besides the standard mechanics of Localizer frequency, inbound course, runway elevation, etc.		Narrative 2 contains no additional information.		Air carrier flight crew, cleared for a visual approach to Runway 31 at BNA, confused MQY for BNA until advised by ATC.

There was around 2,000 LBS in the center tanks and the main tanks were full at departure. The tanks were now showing around 700 LBS less fuel in the left main tank and decreasing while the right main tank showed an ever so slight decrease. Simultaneously, we sent an ACARS to Dispatch about the situation and consulted the QRH. We felt the most likely culprit was the fuel crossfeed valve and used the Crossfeed Selector Inop Checklist, which directed us to check the circuit breaker. It was found to be tripped.  The next step was to check that sufficient fuel was available to both engines. We determined there was not enough fuel to complete the original 2.5-hours flight. At that time, there was still no word from Dispatch so we used commercial radio to establish contact. While we waited to hear from the Dispatcher, we decided to divert to a much closer Station and advised ATC of our intentions and also advised the Dispatcher as well when we made contact. Passengers were informed and the rest of the flight was uneventful. We landed with an imbalance of approximately 2,600 LBS.	The reporter stated that the center fuel tank quantity was about 2,000 LBS on takeoff so the pumps were off in accordance with the minimum 5,000 LBS quantity for pumps on during takeoff. During climb, the intent was to open the center tank crossfeed and activate the pumps, but when the reporter looked at the fuel quantity and saw the imbalance, the QRH was referenced. What was confusing about the system indications was that all pumps and valves appeared to be in the correct position with no lights on, including the Fuel Crossfeed blue light out. They were also confused why right tank fuel pumps did not feed direct tank to engine since the pumps appeared to be operational. The only abnormality was the tripped crossfeed circuit breaker. The crew choose not to turn fuel boost pumps off while troubleshooting for fear or flaming an engine out and instead diverted and were assigned a different aircraft for the remained of that trip.Maintenance later stated that the crossfeed cannon plug connector was cleaned, valve operation verified and the aircraft released. One possible explanation for the fuel usage was the crossfeed valve failed either open or partially open and the left wing tank fuel pumps providing a higher output than the right tank, and therefore feeding both engines. The question remained if the crossfeed valved was in a position other than closed when the reporter was ready to commence crossfeed, why was the blue crossfeed light not ON.			A B737-700 crew discovered a fuel imbalance during climbout caused by a fuel crossfeed fault with a circuit breaker tripped so, while completing the QRH, the crew diverted to landed with a 2,600 LBS imbalance as the left main tank was depleting.

Flying in VNAV, as the speed decayed I pushed FLCH to continue our descent and capture the speed as the airplane would smoothly pitch over. The airspeed continued to decay, but the airplane did not start down, it seemed to level off. I disconnected the autopilot to arrest the speed reduction by continuing the descent. The Relief Pilot and I both noticed that the lower foot seemed excessively high. To prevent the airspeed from approaching the foot, I incorrectly called for flaps one to lower the foot. The Relief Pilot put the handle to flaps one but within a few second he stated that our altitude was too height for flaps so he re-selected flaps up. I do not believe the flaps came out. We were both distracted by what we thought to be an excessively high foot, and I was distracted further by the airplane not descending fast enough with the autopilot on and subsequently hand flying to remain within the appropriate envelope. The foot is higher at higher altitudes, but we both thought it was higher than normal. Using a Green, Yellow, Amber, Red analogy, I was not willing to let the airplane exit the Green realm and I wasn't willing to try and figure out the automation anomalies that seemed to exist. This may or may not be related however the trim setting on the close out was 6.0 and the FMC indicated 8.0 which we all three noticed as being unusually high. Not any of the three of us had seen a trim setting this high. The trim setting actually worked fine for take off, maybe better than usual. The First Officer was on break and not in the cockpit. Next time I am in this situation, I will not be so quick to try and comply with the requested speed reduction but rather coordinate with ATC to possibly delay the speed reduction or maybe take a turn if necessary. I remained well within the proper flight envelope but ATC would probably have been cooperative in delaying the speed reduction.				B777 Captain reports getting slower than desired when directed to slow to 250 KTS by ATC above FL200. FLCH is selected as the speed passes through 250 KTS, but the aircraft does not pitch over. Flaps 1 are called for then immediately retracted due to the altitude and the autopilot is disconnected and the nose pitched over manually. A high nose up trim setting on departure was thought to be factor.

Procedures handled in accordance with QRH. [We] returned for a normal underweight landing. After adrenaline rush of handling the emergency, fatigue set in and I felt I could not safely continue a late night flight.		During turn-out on departure at about 600 FT, Number 1 Engine compressor stalled twice. Engine operated normally at idle and an emergency return to the departure airport [was] executed in accordance with QRH and ATC.		Shortly after takeoff, a B737-800 left engine had two compressor stalls, so an emergency was declared, the QRH completed and the flight returned to the departure airport.

Using our QRH procedures, we tried a reset. The bleed tripped again after about 10 seconds. As we delved back into the QRH, the left bleed tripped also. We tried a reset which failed. We then declared an emergency and began an emergency descent and turn back. When we then detected a smell of something overheating we decided to land at the nearest suitable airport. On landing, we had emergency vehicles assess the aircraft for signs of smoke or fire. Since there were none, we proceeded to the terminal.		While in cruise flight FL410, the right bleed tripped off. This was after smelling a hot odor. We ran the QRH and reset it; it tripped off again. Approximately 30 seconds later the other bleed tripped off, we tried to reset it without success. At this point we declared an emergency and began an emergency descent initially diverting back to the departure airport. The hot odor became much stronger while in the emergency descent, so we elected to divert offline.		B737-700 flight crew experiences a right bleed trip that cannot be reset at FL410. Thirty seconds later the left bleed trips and an emergency descent is initiated. When the smell of something overheating is detected the crew elects to divert to the nearest suitable airport.

Conditions: ILS approach required for ceiling and visibility, blowing snow, wind shear reported on ATIS, braking action good reported by Tower, strong winds aloft, approximately 50 KTS at 2,000 FT AGL (approximately 200 degrees at 50 KTS). Icing conditions on descent and arrival. Engine anti-ice on and wing anti-ice used several times before starting approach (changes stick shaker logic). Autopilot and autothrottles engaged during event. Event Description: ATC usually gives a base turn and then a last vector to final to intercept the Localizer. This night we received a left turn to intercept the Localizer of approximately 120 degrees. The aircraft was clean, airspeed bug approximately four knots above [maneuver] speed. Bank angle set 30 degrees. In the turn, we encountered continuous moderate turbulence. I was the pilot flying with hands on the controls monitoring the automation. In the turn, we received several intermittent bank angle alerts and one intermittent stick shaker that lasted about one second just prior to localizer intercept. The autopilot was managing aircraft control; however, I did not set the automation in a state that allowed enough of a buffer to handle the turbulence with 30 degrees bank at current airspeed. Approach was armed after localizer capture. The automation was used to configure for approach and then disconnected in order the control airspeed on final approach. Wind shear plus/minus 15 KTS encountered during approach which was not relayed by proceeding aircraft. Other areas which increased risk this day were: Crew Scheduling of over eight hours flight time per new regulations, last flight of day running late, first flight with First Officer, fourth First Officer flown within two days. Select a higher speed to increase stall margin in turbulent conditions or select flaps 1 or flaps 5 and fly above bugged speed to increase stall margin. Reduce bank angle during turbulent conditions to increase stall margin, accepting flight path through localizer if needed. Approach could have given us several turns to final which would have made the final intercept less challenging for the current winds and conditions.				B737-700 Captain experiences stick shaker during the turn to intercept the localizer in the clean configuration, along with intermittent bank angle annunciations, in turbulent conditions. Speed had been set at clean maneuver plus five KTS.
